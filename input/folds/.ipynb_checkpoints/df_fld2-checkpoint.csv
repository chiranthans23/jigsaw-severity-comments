"""Kurt and Dave get it on?==

Groaning Kurt released his cock. For the past week he hadn't been able to get off. He tried a cocktail of drugs and a cocktail of whores. Nothing was doing it for him. Masturbating in the shower wasn't even working. Oh he was getting hard all right, he just couldn't fucking cum. And it was driving him nuts.

To top it off, he didn't know why he couldn't cum. The girls had been either hot enough or slutty enough. Even the couple of guys he brought home had been decent. Despite that, he couldn't fucking cum. And a week of that was enough to make anyone more pissy than normal.

Which meant band practice was unlikely to be much fun for anyone.

That was made abundantly clear the moment Kurt stepped into the rehearsal studio. His eyes flicked from Krist to Dave and he came to a sudden stop. Dave was sitting on a couch, a pretty girl in his lap giggling. It was like he was taunting Kurt. And he would have nothing of that.

Stalking over to the drummer and the floozie, Kurt pulled her forcibly out of his lap. The girl squealed and Dave growled, but Kurt paid no attention, forcing the girl out of the studio. After slamming the door he headed back over to Dave. Without a word he pulled the drummer to him and kissed him possessively.

Dave shoved Kurt away, """"What part of no don't you fucking understand!?""""

Krist's eyes widened and he took a step forward, """"Guys, I think—""""

Kurt sent him a silent glare, silencing and stopping him.

""""I don't want you, Kurt. I don't even fucking like you right now,"""" Dave growled. """"In fact, I fucking quit! I don't have to put up with this shit. You're fucking insane. You need some other crackwhore to take my place. I'm not it.""""

Sidestepping the singer, Dave headed towards the door. He barely made three steps before Kurt grabbed him again. This time his back was pulled to Kurt's front. He could clearly feel the singer's erection pressing into his ass.

He wasn't going to be anyone's bitch.

""""I'm just gonna... go,"""" Krist muttered before slipping out of the room quickly.

""""You're fucking mine, Dave,"""" Kurt declared, licking Dave's neck. """"Always.""""

For as small as he was, Kurt had more strength than Dave expected. With considerably less effort than he would have figured, the singer forced the drummer down to the floor. Dave wiggled and tried to crawl away, but all that resulted was in Kurt pulling the drummer's pants off.

Laying down on top of Dave while he worked his own pants off, Kurt hissed in his ear, """"You're mine. You hear me? Fucking mine.""""

""""Stop! Kurt, stop!"""" Dave struggled.

With Kurt's weight on him, the drummer had very little maneuverability. He was completely trapped. But that didn't mean he stopped trying to get away. While wholly his struggling was probably a good thing, it wasn't really helping. If anything it was turning Kurt on more.

Not having the patience to remove Dave's boxers, Kurt reached down and tore the back seam, exposing the drummer's ass. He didn't even pause to warn Dave. His hands spread Dave's cheeks, spit down his crack to provide some lubrication, and quickly pushed his cock in. Dave screamed, wiggling once more to get away. With Kurt's hands holding onto his hips, he had no chance to go anywhere, at least not until the singer was done.

Dave's screams faded into sobs. That alone drove Kurt further, faster. He loved everything about it. The way Dave's ass squeezed his cock better than anyone else's had before. He was a perfect glove, a perfect fit. Before too long a week's worth of unreleased cum spurted from Kurt's cock.

Slowly he pulled out, not really caring about the mixture of blood and semen leaking from Dave's ass. Grinning to himself he refastened his pants. He glanced at Dave, a feeling of superiority infusing him. He totally owned Dave now. 

Does anyone have any basis for this rumour? I would love to put it on the main page.

Well, sure, but that's weak""""35000 is notable, but 19000 isn't"""". Come on. That's not serious.

But even if you had 50,000 hits on Google, I might also have refrained from voting. This is mainly because I am concerned about you putting so much pressure to have your own article. If I was in your position, I would probably keep my distance from the discussion. You are a primary source of information for yourself and, in that sense, your position might be biased. I am not sure whether your attitude fits with the Neutral point of view policy (which applies to articles, but probably also to the way the encyclopedia should be created as a whole). I don't know, and I prefer to abstain from the vote.
Understandable, and advice well taken and appreciated. But I am a justice seeker. I really don't care as much if my entry is deleted or not, as for whether I fight to vindicate my unfair treatment (as I perceive it). Here I was, many moon ago, minding my own damn business, and someone tells me I have a Wiki entry. Interesting. Then someone says it's up for delete. What do I care. I really don't give a damn. But some jerk says it's non-notable (okay by meI didn't konw Wiki policies on this at the time anyway); and vanity. Implying I did it, as self-promotion. This pissed me off. I rebutted the latter charge and did not even mention the notable charge. Later, many months later, someone tells me he has initiated VfD for Palmer's site. Now this was right after the Wiki entries of some CLEARLY notable friends of mine were vandalizedHans-Hermann Hoppe, Lew Rockwell with ridiculous charges of racism etc., of the same type made by Palmer. So I figure, let's take a look at his entry. I did so, and in the ensuing VfD debate, realize there are actual policies on this; I studied them and thought, """"son of a bitch. I qualify. By their own policies. These wikinerds should not have deleted me. And to top it off, the same one who voted to delete me is voting to keep Palmer. Something ain't right."""" So, instead of dishonestly putting up my entry anonymously or through a meatpuppet, I did it myself, nothing hidden. And instead of rolling over and playing dead as I did last time, I decided this time, I will make noise and make sure that if I have anything ot say about it, the voters will be made aware of the policies. That is all. If a fair evaluation of my site and aplication of the policies leads to a good faith vote to delete my entry, I don't care. But what do I see? Peopel who vote to keep Palmer up on the grounds that he is openly gay, or has a large number of publications, or has 13000 google hits, voting to delete me, even though I have similar criteria. It makes it seem arbitrary to me. So can you blame me for monitoring this a little bit, and being a bit frustrated at the seemingly arbitrary actions of some people? Nom.

"Another common theme of the financial 'media' is to claim that Japan is a source of liquidity to the world.  Low interest rates actually reduce liquidity as interest payments are not being made on loans, and thus, money isn't available for financial intermediaries to recycle back into making new loans.  The money supply in Japan has been steadily declining for at least the past few years, yet world stock markets have been reaching new highs, and assets of all kinds have been bid to sky-high valuations.  Thus, it can be argued that the asset bubble is being driven by money supply expansion in Europe and the United States, and not by the shrinking money supply in Japan.

The bottom line is that I don't feel this will have a happy ending for the United States.  The dollar has dropped 5.5% in the past week, which, for the world's largest economy, is pretty much on the threshold of a currency crisis.",0.0

 ban or block? 

As I understand it, a ban is something imposed on a user by the community appointed Arbcom or Jimbo Wales by fiat for whatever reason, and a block is something any admin does to an individual user account or IP address for predetermined reasons (usually vandalism, sometimes immediately if the vandalism is severe or offensive enough, or in the case of continued actions by users blatantly against policy in the face of multiple warnings). They can both be for a set time or permanent. Bans can be permanent, blocks of user accounts can be permanent, but we don't like to permablock IP addresses. As in the case of Jessica, I blocked (what I believe to be) her IPs for 6 mos., so it ever gets reassigned to another computer after that time that computer can conceivably register for a new user account. Known shared IPs are blocked for much less time. Admins are supposed to use Arbcom mandated block ranges to enforce bans, but don't themselves declare bans on other users in order to block or have other admins block. That way, admin actions can be reversed by other admins or even by themselves if they change their minds, but bans """"from above"""" can't be lifted by admins.

Surely, even the most ardent supporter of animal rights can see that this is simply supposed to be a list of material facts about an aspect of human behavior that has existed in one form or another since the dawn of time?  There are many other places on Wikipedia where they can read and contribute their individual viewpoints on the ethical, moral and practical points of animal consumption.

NOT BEING NEUTRAL & CONFLICT OF INTEREST

Blackpearl14 does not understand what vandalism is, and wrongly calls anyone who contributes per the polices of wikipedia a vandal.  She is not neutral and is in complete conflict of interest.  Based on Blackpearl4's own posting comments about herself, she believes Wikipedia is her forum and that she is owner and controller of anything to do with the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean.  When you complain about her actions, she wrongly calls you things, like saying you are attacking her and such.  

NOTE: Blackpearll4 - calls herself evidently Mrs. Johnny Depp and Pirate lord-ess and such.  She  celebrates on her official wikipedia bio pages that she did many pages and articles on the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean for wikipedia.   Why would someone devote so much time to 24/7 check the site and on these pages?   Has her judgement become impaired?   Her goal to fuse her love and fantasies with the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean is very clear.  That is a conflict of interest and that is not being neutral.  Sorry if your feelings are hurt,  but if one purchases products, such as Pirates of the Caribbean posters, toys and Walt Disney merchandise and also using emotional love and fantasies for wikipedia / wikinews articles, doesn’t make the articles neutral and it causes a conflict of interest.

Since “conflict of interest” “neutral” is an important subject since “conflict of interest” is being herald by wikinews / wikipedia staff and volunteers, including being used by wikipedia/wikinews administrators and editors with which to have an article /story be deleted, and is grounds for action against a contributor, then please immediately provide documentation that editors, administrators and people providing articles and information to wikipedia and wikinews have no conflict of interest to the articles and stories they create, edit, supervise and/or contribute.  For example, did any editor have sexual relationship with a porn star or purchase movies or magazines of a porn star whose bio is listed on wikipedia?   This is a conflict of interest.   Another example, does any administrator, editor or volunteer of Wikinews and Wikipedia including “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra”, “Chris Mann” and “Whoville” own Disney stock, have gone to any Disney theme park, watch Disney movies and/or buy Disney products?   Then “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” and all of these editors and administrators are in conflict of interest.  Does the people involved with the wikinews articles about fossilized fish found in Canada, or with scientific discoveries or with lawsuits, have any connection to these products, places or businesses?  Then this is a conflict of interest.  What kind of verification did Wikinews and Wikipedia use to determine that volunteers including “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” don’t sell Disney products and have no business with the Walt Disney Company and their affiliates?    As documented volunteers including “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” together claim “conflict of interest” and delete any contribution in regards to Pirates of the Caribbean for either wikinews or wikipedia, and control it by upholding double standards.  Thus first we must verify wikinews / wikipedia enforcement of their policy of “conflict of interest” and “neutral”.

Wikipedia and Wikinews editors don't follow Wikinews' own written polices... “Do you know of an issue that has been forgotten?”. Then you generate and justify reason after reason to state that the above article is not newsworthy, and that wiki does not write old news. You even say one thing, and then later change that to be different claims to justify deletion.   You keep throwing different claims at an article you have targeted because someone had shown the charges to be untrue.   Wikinews and Wikipedia continues to uphold double standards, and then make statements with which to justify it.  Incredible, you ignore any details provided to your counter your claims, and then accuse the person of not acknowledging your control and your new set of claims.  Are you aware that Wikinews editors and wikipedia are in conflict of interest as well?   They proven that they have a network of supporting friends, using double standards, without following Wikinews and wikipedia's own written polices, and such. 

Wikinews and wikipedia allows editors “fans” to be bias, controlling whatever they choose to write even placing things like porn stars penis size, (copies of that have been documented as well) and to write articles that are one sided, promotional and links to various sites that further promote their cause, yet the editors delete anything that is added that they don’t approve from other people, and then justify reason after reason, such as claiming other people as being a conflict of intere",0.0
"""==Kolyma==
I came across the Kolyma article while checking out some facts presented in a Danish newspaper article and was surprised to see that it had been marked as lacking neutrality in view of assertations made about the Kolyma Gulag (without reliable references, etc.). As I believe it is extremely important to ensure that the story of the Gulag is presented properly, I have spent a few hours on this article. The main problem seems to be that the author is not too familiar with Wiki editing. So I have begun to straighten a few things out - in particular correct internal links to the authors cited, additional links to the outside world and some footnoting. It would be great if some of the experts on Russia and Russian (Soviet) history could chip in too.
There has been a suggestion that the geographical page on Kolyma should be separated from the article on the Gulag. Sooner or later, I think we should do that but the immediate problem is one of establishing the authenticity of the current write-up.
I found it interesting that of all the Kolyma articles in other languages - and there are currently 16 (see http://bs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolima) - only two (French and Catalan) describe the Gulag. Poland has a special page on this.
I look forward to hearing from interested parties.
 Thank you for your effort in cleaning this up. I had several concerns about how these historical topics are reflected in the Wikipedia, in particular:
 Gross inflation of casualty numbers (I think the current version is more or less ok for that)
 Use of strong emotional terms to describe an encyclopedic subject, which is completely unacceptable in my opinion. List the numbers, the facts and let the reader do the math. There is a little bit of that left in the current version, but it's probably ok now, too.
 Biased representation of the camps as working only to destroy as many people as possible, and comparison to Nazi death camps. The goal of the Soviet system was to industrialize the country in 10 years (something that the Western countries covered in two centuries before that), and to prepare for the inevitable large-scale war against countless aggressors  Germany, the US, Japan, etc, each of whom has invaded Russia just two decades prior to that. To that end, the most important purpose of the camps was to build the industry that has later launched the man in space and up to this day is in the heart of modern Russia, and to manage to do so in complete isolation and with very few available resources, before getting attacked. The brutality of the methods is very regrettable, but should be mentioned in an objective article along with the actual productive goals of the program, and the benefits the country has reaped, although at a very, very high price.
 Drawing most of the information from Solzh's Gulag and dissidents' accounts, who most certainly should not monopolize the license for eternal truth. As I mentioned in the page's discussion, eyewitness accounts are important, but not the only one and by far not the most objective source of info. If you record testimony of 227 inmates of Abu Ghraib or Guantánamo Bay, they will say that those places are hell on Earth, the most mercilessly terrorized, particularly sadistic and the most unimaginably cruel human-run organizations, and the whole US concentration camp system is """"evil"""", as, they would probably claim, are the US themselves. This alone would not make a good article on Guantánamo Bay. 
 Furthermore, Solzh's book was used as an ideological weapon against the 70's and later Soviet Union to present even the second part of the 20th century in Russia as one endless deadly torture and gulag, which is, of course, a complete nonsense.
Given that hysterical overestimation and bias are very common in the West when it comes to these topics, I long ago gave up on trying to thoroughly improve related pages, because every time it sparks an endless flame war with people who tell me about tens and hundreds of millions of fictional casualties, and then my edits get erased or lost in the never-ending stream of b.s. So now I only do minor corrections, and appreciate when people try to constructively research the topic. If the arguments I presented here would help you in your further editing, then good; if not, then Wikipedia will remain a place of hysterical hatred for anything Soviet, especially in comparison to much more mellow and well-researched Britannica and Encarta.  
I appreciate these comments and will certainly bear them in mind for future editing.

"Vinny Burgoo = suspected sock puppet

Are you ever going to withdraw this accusation? It's currently the second hit with a Google search with 'Vinny Burgoo' (my one and only online identity for nearly ten years) and it's wholly bogus. Someone posted something in support of something very stupid I had done at Wiktionary (I called a serial Wiki tyrant a 'c**t' after he had unambiguously broken Wiki's rules, then I compounded this by threatening him in what I thought at the time to be a transparently jocular manner, but wasn't) and this 'supporter' was assumed to be me using another identity and another IP trying to get around a temporary block. I still use Wikipedia a lot but have no interest whatsoever in editing it ever again, so by all means say that I was blocked for disruptive editing (guilty: I got fed up with the lot of you) or whatever else I was accused of before this puppeteer nonsense was settled on (the crime kept changing) but I'm not happy with what you currently show.

"This is a special case because while it is a commonly accepted usage, it is also commonly accepted usage for a host of other concepts of divinity, that often differ dramatically from the YHWH of the Hebrew Bible and Ezekiel. Specifying YHWH as per the text is surely an improvement over the generic term, being more precise. And if I'm not mistaken, the Vatican is the major significant party to restrict usage of the Hebrew term among themselves, in favor of non-Hebrew names, for some doctrine of theirs of papal infallibility.  I don't see that as an overriding reason not to use the more specific Hebrew name where it is more appropriate.  However I agree with John that use of the name YHWH for God in Ezekiel can be more fully explained in a section of text.  /talk/",0.0

"""ok, agree, is this suitable? (I still think - to reasonably define the lemma - it is needed to mention the rough figures 130% and 13% when the debt crisis started, but not as a cause; and it it short enough to qualify for a lead):

Ok, taking into account the various discussions (thanks for the constructive contributions), I am deriving a lead start not mentioning the 130% debt and 13% deficit ratios so nobody is inclined to think this is already mentioning the causes:

 The Greek government-debt crisis (also known as the Greek Depression) is an ongoing multi-year crisis having begun between late 2009 and April 2010. At that time Greece had a €300 billion debt level. This situation was broadly recognized as the start of the Greek government-debt crisis because Greece lost the ability to service its existing debt, as it was neither capable to refinance due payments with new debt issues because of a reduced creditworthiness, nor able to meet its debt obligations via a budget surplus including any sale of assets.
 Starting autumn 2010, the eurozone states Ireland, Portugal, Spain, and Cyprus also slid into a debt crisis. These debt crisis together including the Greek one also have been referred to as the """"European debt crisis"""". The five debt crisis shared some similarities, but also had its differences with respect to causes, measures, and crisis evolvement.

The third paragraph should now list the causes. I have no problems that overlapping causes are listed as that is how reality was. I also have no problems if there is one sentence about there being special views on causes (but please let's stop to put sources close to Marxism in any prominence as these is not the broad view)

"""

Example:
""""The opening movement  is performed by all forceswith the exception of the recorders """" can be sourced to a score
""""The opening movement  is performed by all forces with the exception of the recorders """" (emhasis added) contains an interpretation which can not be sourced to a (primary source) score. Unless the editor of that score inserted a text note to that effect (or Bach wrote such note in his manuscript which I don't think is the case here). In that case the name of the editor needs to be given (the editor is the source, not the music Bach wrote down and which was transferred to a printed score), preferably also date of publication, etc.
I'd recommend to change all """"score"""" references to a publicly available score (if possible). Then the interpretations that aren't directly clear from the music notes and accidentals on the page, get different references with named authors.

Anyhow, what is interpretation and what is non-interpretative deduction I can't check, while the references are made to a publication I currently have no access to.

More important is to understand what WP:PRIMARY is about, when writing an article. The answer above didn't put me at ease... so yes the dozens of references to the (Bärenreiter) """"score"""" source need to be checked. I don't feel like putting the  template on top of the page while probably most of these are in order, but that's in fact what I should do until it is all checked. Now anyone can familiarize themselves with WP:PRIMARY and do the checking, but failing time and means and/or other candidates to do the checks, I'd have to put up  until it is done.

"A Short History of Republican Sinn Féin  

In 1902, Arthur Griffith, Editor of the United Irishman, presented to the third annual convention of Cumann na nGaedheal the most revolutionary political idea since the fall of Parnell; it was that the elected Irish Members of Parliament should refuse to sit in Westminster, demand reinstitution of the Irish Parliament of 1782, and pledge allegiance only to a king of Ireland, not to the King of England. While the Liberator, Daniel O’Connell, had once considered such unilateral action, he had not forced the issue. Griffith provided a strategy of passive resistance by turning an assembly of Irish MPs into a de facto constitutional convention. Modeled on Frank Deak’s policy, which resulted in the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary in 1867, Griffith serialized his abstentionist program in the United Irishman as the Resurrection of Hungary, and then published it as a pamphlet and distributed it widely in 1904. The direct result of this idea was the formation of Sinn Féin on 28th November 1905, as an abstentionist political party, with internal self-reliance as its principal plank, pledging never to recognize or use the services or forces of the enemy. The founders of Sinn Féin were Arthur Griffith, Seán T. O’Kelly, Bulmer Hobson, Countess Markiewicz and Seán Mac Diarmada. In addition to contesting a Parliamentary election in North Lietrim in 1908, Sinn Féin was also active locally, electing a number of men to county councils and other local bodies. 

Historian, lecturer, Conradh na Gaeilge president and Radio Free Éireann (public service broadcasting, 99.5 FM in New York) commentator Nollaig Ó Gadhra points out that the big change in Sinn Féin came in the Árd Fheis of 1917, when the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) under the guidance of Michael Collins and the Irish Volunteers under Cathal Brugha, caused Sinn Féin to change its policy from monarchist to republican abstention. After the Rising, Sinn Féin adopted an election manifesto for all elections, insisting upon the Irish Republic Proclaimed on Easter Monday, 1916. Éamonn deValera, campaigning in an Irish Volunteer uniform, was elected for East Clare in June 1917. At the Árd Fheis of Sinn Féin in October 1917, Arthur Griffith graciously stepped down from President to Vice President of Sinn Féin, to allow the election of deValera, who, after the death on hunger strike of Thomas Ashe, was the senior surviving Commandant from 1916. 

This was the Sinn Féin which contested the general election of 14 December 1918, promising to NOT represent their constituents or their country in the mighty Westminster Parliament in London, but rather to set up, without foreign let or hindrance, a Republican assembly which would form an Irish government for Ireland. Sinn Féin won over 79% of the popular vote in all Ireland, and 73 of 105 seats, in what can only be described as a plebiscite for independence. The delegates who assembled in the Mansion House in Dublin formed the First Dáil Éireann and issued the Irish Declaration of Independence on 21 January 1919 (legally the equivalent of the American Declaration of Independence by the Second Continental Congress, promulgated on the 4th of July 1776). That Easter Monday, 1916 is regarded as the significant date is a consequence of the pre-existing Army Council of the Irish Republican Army – Óglaigh na hÉireann (the IRA) insisting upon the First Dáil Éireann recognizing the Irish Republic proclaimed in arms in 1916, as a condition for the IRA coming under the authority of the government formed by the First Dáil Éireann. [See also Dorothy Macardle, The Irish Republic (New York, 1965).] 

The democratic voice of the Irish people had spoken (vox populi, vox Dei), and their elected representatives sought the recognition of their national self-determination as promised by American President Woodrow Wilson’s Fourteen Points, on which basis the Armistice ending the Great War on 11 November 1918, had been accepted by the Central Powers. Ireland was denied recognition and a seat at the Versailles peace conference. The ensuing conflict between the forces of the Imperial Government in London and the Irish Republic has become known to history as the “Black and Tan War” (1919-1921). But, the military lessons of Dublin 1916 having been studied in the internment camp of Frongoch, the forces of the Irish Republic waged an asymmetrical conflict against the alien forces of occupation. Modern guerilla warfare entered on to the twentieth century. England, though still in control of many strong points, could no longer coerce Ireland into remaining peacefully within her empire. A Second (Republican) Dáil Éireann came together in August 1921 (124 Sinn Féin and 4 Unionist members). Nollaig Ó Gadhra, in Civil War in Connacht (Cork & Dublin: Mercier Press, 1999), points out that the Sinn Féin delegates regarded their mandate to be as Teachta Dála Éir",0.0

I continue to disagree. Other articles demonstrate that it is entirely possible to have readable, easy-to-use tables with sufficient numbers of columns to display results for all the parties under discussion. They also show techniques to deal with parties sometimes being reported and sometimes not, and sometimes being reported together. There is no need for the opinion polling table to be so abbreviated. Thus, we should reflect what the citations say. If polls are released that lump everyone other than the four biggest parties as """"other"""", that's fine  we report """"other"""". If polls are released that give results for the Greens, BNP etc., then we should report those. We should be doing our best to avoid a situation where we are in danger of original research: I understand the 'cliff edge' argument, but that approach should be a last resort.

I have presented several factual arguments, and they were quashed almost instantaneously. This is not your own personal website to cover up the truth.

Evolution is not a fact. And before you go delete-happy again, answer any one of these points.

You say """"this article references evolution as an observable natural process and as the valid explanation for the diversity of life on earth.""""

Evolution has never been observed. Ever. Not one single transitory fossil, out of hundreds of thousands found from hundred of millions of years ago, not one has ever been found. Ever. Not one. No proof.

Fossils of mammals, found tens of millions of year ago, that look exactly like they do today. Through continental shifts, wild temperature changes, mass extinctions, floods, asteroids; they look exactly like they did from the beginning.

200 million year old lobsters look like 2 year old lobsters

There is no mention that gas does not clump in a vacuum, proving the big bang could not have happened, using the very laws of physics that you hold so close.

There is no mention that no one has ever observed a blue shift.

There is no mention that it's mathematically improbable for evolution to have occurred. No mention that human DNA is so incredibly complex it could not just have come in to being through pure chance.

There is no mention that not enough time has passed for cells to randomly have created the diverse life on earth.

There is no explanation of the Cambrian Explosion - only 1 phylum before, yet 13! afterward.

Sphinx Facing Leo vs Orion Rising - Witness to God

The real reason for the Sphinx is that at the top of Orion , above the shoulders is a faint face , the very same face as the face of the Sphinx, and additionally, this face did formally, paint the side of the great pyramid to shows its clear outline and facial details , which are the same as the face of the Sphinx (before the local massive desecration by the Muslims who defaced all 3 pyramids by removing the outer very polished face of all 3 pyramids). And that face there at top of Orion and the same face as the Sphinx, IS the face of Allah/God there for all to see and there projecting on the side of the great pyramid, before that gigantic desecration of Allah by Muslims.

In addition, this alignment at the time of ORION RISING (at sunrise) ALSO predicts the time of the coming of Allah/ God / Jesus (about NOW) the reason for the alignment. AND HOW could the builders of the Sphinx and the Great Pyramids know all this, by revelations from God/Allah, and NOT ALIENS flying about to TEACH THEM.

This face is also more universal than even this, as the Srinagar, India Buddha, on side of small hill in India has the very same face (instead of the usual, many generic stylized normal Buddha faces) and this particular Buddha is thought to be Maitreya , which is the Buddhist version of Jesus Second Coming.... And on and on.... Now Look Up & SEE ,

f.n. and that face of the Sphinx (heavily damaged by mainly those firing rifles at it again in huge desecration) but STILL visible adequately to anyone giving a little thought to it ,,,, is ALSO the 'pillar at the border of Egypt , a witness to GOD/Lord (not a witness to you but a witness to God himself, who is ALLAH as there is ONLY ONE GOD) as it IS HIS FACE, see Isaiah 19: 19 - """"In that day shall there be an altar to the LORD in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof to the LORD."""" please add above to 'correct' whole article thanks 47.18.43.166 (talk) C, MP

 Addditionally, the Pleiades constellation has the very same face there for all to see, and is the reason for alignment of many ancient temples with the Pleiades as their 'presentment' or back temple walls so aligned to SHOW ALSO (as the side of the great pyramid, that same face of God/Allah at certain times of the year .... ref also Lauscau cave apse alignments ... add'l note for the Doublas Wells, can you ever allow adding normal facts as these, without obstructing the very point of Wikipedia to have articles discussing the facts pertinent and involved in the relevant article, without defacing endlessly the very discussion with drivel claims ... thanks curator astral record sr ... 47.18.43.166  """,0.0

Not because of presentation of scientific arguments which are presented much better in later reviews which includes later reviews. The same would apply to, say, the Mismeasure of Man.

Hello Túrelio. I have a question: how do I remove redirects in Commons? The reason: I have been trying to rename categories in the Portuguese namespace with appropriate English variants. Anyhow, I discovered several propriate English category names with redirects to Portuguese variant. The issue to rename to English has been discussed at an appropriate Commons discussion page, and I had begun converting the Portuguese-language names into English. But, one of the users responsible for Portuguese-only naming has created English-to-Portuguese redirects rather then the reverse. How can I remove the redirects, to therefore, apply Portuguese-to-English redirects? I attempted to blank, and obviously, the system did not permit this. Any counsel?",0.0

The text added in the article translates this entry as: In an ecclesiastical entry .... noted that some of the Christian Greek clergy had linguistic difficulties in administrating to their congregation, as Christian villagers living within the region of Delvinë were Albanian speaking.

It's hardly enough from the original text to conclude that the villagers were in general monolinguals, indeed it claims that Albanian speech was present and in significant numbers (it doesn't also conclude that all villages were Albanian speaking). Moreover, the fact that this produced linguistic difficulties in eclessiastical administration is something that only indirectly can be concluded, since the Codex mentions that """"a specific bishop, who came from Smyrna, found it not pleasant to hear his flock speaking Albanian, beacause of the Albanian speaking villages in  his periphery, and resigned after 25 years of local service.""""

In most cases in this article the lawsuits filed against MonaVie are used as sources of information about the company.

When editors say that the company is controversial and add multiple lawsuits filed against the company as direct support of the controversy the editors are providing their original research and opinion about the company. Wikipedia has a policy of No original research, and all of these lawsuits must be removed and the underlying statements that are supported solely by the lawsuits must be removed.

 M-hmmmmmm....... 

So, you think that I was ranting, when during the entire article I explicitly noted that I am not, and that this is a serious issue that need not be """"stricken down"""" as hate speech or ranting. Let me rebut all the things you posted on my talk page:

- Ok, """".com"""" stands for commerce, but if you read my post without any bias in mind, that wasn't even my argument. I was just basically pointing out the fact that """".co.uk"""" is explicitly UK, and that """".com"""" can be anything, though it is necessarily NOT explicitely UK, as many of Wiki's articles seem to be.

- Yes, I said I didn't know where to start, meaning I didn't know where to begin addressing the issue, not that I don't know where to start addressing this issue.

- """"Secondly, there is Wiki policy that articles dealing with American topics have American English spellings, and articles about British stuff have British English spellings. If White House has British spellings in it, by all means change them to the US ones.""""
    
 I'm not exactly sure what you're trying to tell me here, but my guess is that you assume that I don't know about the current Wikipolicy, and that you obviously don't understand what I clearly stated. I am arguing that Wikipedia should either have ALL British spelling, or ALL standard English spelling (a.k.a - """"American english), but preferabally standard English because this isn't a British website, and because as an encyclopedia, all the information should be unified under one context and/or dialect.

- My point wasn't """"British are the only people that use British spelling."""" (although in a literal sense, this is a strong point outside of context), it was that """"The majority of the English speaking population use Standard English."""". If I seemed to use the former point, then either the way you interpreted my words was wrong, or I misworded my intentional argument. If I did, then my apologies.

- """"But every other English-speaking country used the standard spelling, which is generally based on how the word actually sounds"""" 
Again, you missed a subtle point that changed the entire meaning of my words. See the word generally? What I mean by this, if you can't already comprehend, is that many words in the British spelling include silent letters. Here's an example of one: pAEdophile. If one trys to pronounce this word by the letters, it would sound something like """"PAH-EHD-OH-FILE"""", adding an extra syllable, when it's really pronounced """"PE-DOH-FILE"""", which pretty much follows how the Standard English form is spelled. 

- I'm not very new to Wiki, and if that's a subtle way for you to try to undermind my intelligence, then I resent that statement. And again, do not take my words as rants. Anybody who understands the inherent nature of an encyclopedia understands that this is an important issue. Anyways, the way I worded my post was nowhere near the definition of a rant, please use a dictionary and find out what a rant is for yourself.

Please, if you can't understand the importance of this issue solely based on personal agenda (I understand you are British), then stay out of this. You have no credibility if this is the case since you cannot make a rational decision. If you haven't noticed, everything I posted had rationale behind it.

 Dear Just plain Bill 
 Please explain why you could ignore the fact that User:Michael Bednarek couldn't have answered at all and, moreover, revert as if you were User:Michael Bednarek and User:Spinningspark.
 Please explain why you cannot wait and see for a while(only 72 hours, as mentioned above). 
 Apparently your vandalism reverts have no reasonable reason as well as Bednarek's and Spinningspark's, because you, Spinningspark, and Bednarek have left the 1)lead 2)unsourced, that looks like evil vandalism and cruel personal attack with bald-faced lies. Please explain why you could ignore your obvious contradictions(lies).
 Please explain why you can think that disambiguation pages without necessary important lead can be helpful as an encyclopedia(WP:5P).
 Please explain why you can think that disambiguation pages without necessary important lead can be written from a neutral point of view(WP:5P) and why you have tried to force us stop kind and quick-witted human beings with common sense. (It seemed that , , and User:Spinningspark are cruel Nazis, or facists, unfortunately.) 
 The third pillar of WP:5P says, """"Wikipedia is free content that anyone can edit, use, modify, and distribute"""". This means that Wikipedias are not even admins' private websites and that to revert other editors' distributions unreasonably is not helpful and not preferable at all. Please explain why you can have been doing the contrary.
 The forth pillar of WP:5P says, """"Editors should interact with each other in a respectful and civil manner"""". Please explain why you can have been doing the opposite.
 The fifth pillar of WP:5P says, """"Wikipedia does not have firm rules"""". Please explain why you can have been saying and doing the contrary.
 Please explain why you can ignore all of WP:5P?
 Please explain why you can delete the most important lead which explains from its original meanings. The important lead that you deleted unreasonably is below: """"Harmonic is originally an adjective relating to the combination of musical notes to create chords, later, becomes a noun meaning a soft high note played on a stringed instrument by not pressing the string all the way down"""". 
 Please explain why you can leave the unsourced OR sentence while unfairly accusing me of """"unsourced OR"""". The OR lead you have left is below: """"usually refers to the frequency components of a time-varying signa"""".  
 Please explain why you can express(lie) """"restore"""", though in fact you """"ruin""""ed the lead apparently. 
 Please explain why you didn't edit positively at all when you are not satisfied with others' edits.

 Please explain why you cannot be responsible at all for the  tag""""For other uses, see Harmonic (disambiguation)"""" in the article page """"Harmonic"""".

There are not a single contemporary scholar (academics university professors) linguistics, historian, population geneticist on this planet, who support that fantasy theory.

These shaman """"scholars"""" are usually electricians, blacksmiths, masons, car-mechanic in the real life, so they have no any university degrees.

Just read our discussions in the talkpage of Hungarian turanism: Forexample he consider Ferenc Zajti (shaman-scholar) as one of the greatest historian, Zajti was who invented the theory of Parthian - Hungarian Jesus. (according to Zajti Jesus Christ was not a Jew but a proto-Hungarian). These turan-believer-boys are often racist, they consider the Indo-Europeans and Semitic people and their culture as inferior and subhuman who created a very low primitive culture, and they consider the culture and race of Central Asian nomadic Turkic people as superior culture and race.

Get this, they have 2 pumpers, 1 mini pumper, 1 tanker, 1 ladder truck, and 1 rescue truck from the city.... AS WELL AS 1 pumper, 1 mini pumper, and 1 rescue from the southern door fire dept...... And they have only started (as of this writing) to try and put it out!!!!! Even then, there are only 3 people actively fighting the fire - the rest are just standing around WATCHING!!!

WHAT.... THE..... F***!?!?!?!?!?! When did the fire dept turn wimps??? And WHY are the citizens paying for all these firefighters when they're not doing anything???

Will fast-track the photos, and get them up on the """"sturgeon bay"""" yahoo group by tuesday, should anyone care to see them.

""":As a sub-mariner, I'm sure you are quite aware what """"over and out"""" means.
However, your request is very polite, and entirely reasonable, so it would seem both very impolite and very unreasonable not to reply, and hence I had intended to respond usefully.
But Mr Beestra has taken on the role of divine retribution and dramatically interferred.
I hope you won't be offended if I don't reply right now.
In very brief summary, I  had intended to say something to the effect that your knowledge in the area is thorough and reliable. However, your manner is somewhat abbrasive - in my personally admitted completely biassed opinion: """"It ain't what you do, it's the way that you do it.""""
Any further response would almost certainly lead to me making comments about Mr Beestra's objectivity, so I won't continue.
My closing comment would be: Please keep up the good work, but take off your hobnail boots and replace them with soft slippers.
Best wishes,

 Oregon Vortex 

 Hello Queen Cake!  Your comments to me about the """"veracity"""" and the """"worthiness"""" of my edit to the article on the Oregon Vortex were nothing short of rude.  Have you been there?  Do you believe an eye witness is less reliable than someone with a Ph.D., or less who has NEVER been there?  Someone who has never been in the energy and has had the oppotunity to experience all the things that the article derides?  That """"optical illusion"""" that occurs with two people does not happen in a controlled environment.  It takes place in the great outdoors.  And I have also seen the golf balls, and many, many other things.  I now see that Wikipedia is nothing more than a forum for frustrated editors and writers who have never sold anything worthwhile and this is their last claim to fame, and they're going to go for it for all it's worth, regardless of whether they distort the truth or not.  Getting your name out there is what's MOST important.  What arrogance!!!  You don't even live in the US, let alone Oregon!  I have been to the vortex many, many times, and I will swear on a warehouse of Bibles that all the phenomena is just that:  PHENOMENA.

"Regarding AZ helping Ahmed Ressam get to Canada  my reading of his CSR Transcript is exactly the opposite.  He asked Ahmed Ressam if he could get him five (stolen?) Canadian passports, because he was tired of being a stateless person in Pakistan.

Regarding whether AZ ran the Khaldan camp  didn't he testify that he hadn't paid a visit to Khaldan for years?  I thought his testimony confirmed that he was part of the camp's management team.  But, if the camp had been a college I think his role(s) would be closest to that of the college registrar and placement officer.  A registrar confirms that applicants grades are in order, and officially informs them that they have been admitted.  AZ ran houses where he formed an assessment as to whether applicants were good candidates for training.  And, once they finished their training, he helped those who wanted to go fight in Chechnya or Israel to slip into those conflict zones.  He had helped grads slip into Bosnia, during the civil war there.  

I think it would have been more accurate to say Ibn al Shaykh al Libi ran the camp.  His location was a secret for four years.  He was found in a Libyan prinson in April, by human rights workers, who conducted an initial interview with him.  And a few weeks later the Libyans reported he committed suicide.  I really think it would serve public safety if we had heard his version  his pre-torture versions  of what the camp did.",0.0

To repeat what I'd already said at ANI, I am not alleging a topic ban breach, except perhaps under the """"broadly construed"""" wording. I am stating that, based on the manner of this series of reverts on The Automobile Association , followed by this 'rewrite', and based on the fact that HighKing has yet to make any associated comment at Talk:The Automobile Association, instead choosing to treat this as an issue of """"vandalism"""", HighKing has inarguably ignored the warnings Cailil gave him when he re-enacted the BI topic ban about his future conduct. Those can still be seen on his own talk page under the """"Removals of the term British Isles (again)"""" section on HighKing's talk page, so he has no excuse for not remembering them. You're going to have to read that whole thread to get the picture, but it shows quite clearly that Cailil was quite explicit in what he expected from HighKing going forward, in addition to simply adhering to the topic ban: he must stop edit warring and start discussing, he must stop this behaviour of policing terminology on Wikipedia, he must stop introducing (and maintaining by reverts) innacuracies (his altered version of the quote is not in the source, so is clearly innacurate). Basically, he was telling him to just go and find something completely different to do than this, because it is of no benefit to the project. What he has done instead, is just transfer his focus from policing usage of the term 'British Isles' on Wikipeda, to policing the term 'Republic of Ireland', while mainaining the same bad behaviours - edit warring, lack of discussion, misrepresentation of sources, misuse of guidelines/policy, etc, etc. As an administrator, the onus is on you to step in and stop it. Five years is long enough to be still getting away with this sort of WP:TE in the way you have so far allowed him to in this case. You need to block HighKing now until he gives cast iron assurances he understands why Cailil wrote those things on his talk page, and tells you precisely how he proposes to avoid it in future. That's it. As far as evidence goes, short of me pulling out direct quotes of what Cailil said to HighKing, I don't see what more you need to see, to do what is required of you.   """,0.0

I appreciate your reasoned explanation of the edits, Lucericr, but it is still troubling that Chzz chose to enforce Wikipedia's policies for personal rather than objective reasons (and please, no more inane references to WP:AGF or the like; it is perfectly obvious why Chzz felt motivated to decimate my contributions to the Soft3D page). It is becoming abundantly clear that this web site's objectivity is compromised by a small group of privileged admins, some of whom manipulate policy and selectively enforce standards to their own personal tastes. So much for the encyclopedia that """"anyone can edit.""""

John Peel
Thanks Wikiklrsc, I had forgotten that he'd phoned in an article to the Liverpool Echo, though at the time he had pretended to be a reporter.
On the 1st Marriage I don't know why you've modified my edit on that as it is accurate (source: Peel's autobiography & a few websites). You say the modification was """"due to being unclear on the motivation of prior edits by """"AllanHainey"""""""" - my motivation is to have a full & complete wikipedia entry. I will check Peels autobiography tonight for more details & re-add info on this, as a 1st marriage (especially to a 15 year old) is a significant part of his life & should be included. If you've got any objection or reason not to include this we can discuss it on the talk page.

Hi, thanks for email. I deleted your article because 
it did not provide independent verifiable sources to enable us to verify the facts and show that it meets the notability guidelines. Sources that are not acceptable include those linked to the company, social media and other sites that can be self-edited, blogs, websites of unknown or non-reliable provenance, and sites that are just reporting what the company claims or interviewing its management. Your references where all linked to the company, no independent sources. The claim that would make it notable, the number of downloads, has no independent verification.
it was written in a promotional tone. Articles must be neutral and encyclopaedic. The list of features is entirely unsurced, and makes unsubstantiated claims like ''this is one of the most used features in APUS Launcher... According to APUS(!), it can intelligently push useful information like weather, traffic, etc. to users.

Your edits indicate that you have an obvious conflict of interest when it comes to editing articles about this subject. Thank you for declaring your interest. If, after reading the information about notability linked above, you still believe that your organisation is notable enough for a Wikipedia article (and that there is significant coverage in reliable, independent secondary sources), you could, if you wish, post a request at Wikipedia:Requested articles for the article to be created. See also Wikipedia:Best practices for editors with conflicts of interest.

 The nature of your edits also gives the impression you have a financial stake in promoting a topic. Paid advocacy is a category of conflict of interest (COI) editing that involves being compensated by a person, group, company or organization to use Wikipedia to promote their interests. Paid advocacy is prohibited by our policies on neutral point of view and what Wikipedia is not, and is an especially egregious type of COI; the Wikimedia Foundation regards it as a black hat practice.Paid advocates are very strongly discouraged from direct article editing, and should instead propose changes on the talk page of the article in question if an article exists, and if it does not, from attempting to write an article at all. At best, any proposed article creation should be submitted through the articles for creation process, rather than directly.Regardless, if you are receiving or expect to receive compensation for your edits, you are required by the Wikimedia Terms of Use to disclose your employer, client and affiliation. You can post such a mandatory disclosure to your user page at User:. The template  can be used for this purpose – e.g. in the form:  {{paid|user=|employer=InsertName|client=InsertName}}. If I am mistaken – you are not being directly or indirectly compensated for your edits – please state that in response to this message. If you are being compensated, please provide the required disclosure. In either case, please do not edit further until you answer this message.

 Power Station Vandalism 

I am writing to question you of your suspected involvement in a vandalism attack on a local power station in Reading, England. We have reason to believe you are the ring leader of a vandal street gang known as the 'Purple Unity and Red Jack's' that are localised to southern Reading. On Thursday 21st April 2011, upon the residents of the area witnessing the attack, in which seven vandals caused costly damage to the structure and it's fences as well as many surrounding trees, a cardboard banner was attached to the fence reading """"Under orders of Gwern"""".

This is not the only occasion in which your Wikipedia account has been referenced. On Saturday January 1st 2011, the same gang was seen attempting to transport themselves onto the Madejski Stadium roof using cannons to release a banner over the East Stand reading """"We will never bow to hatred; we will never fall to society, we will never rest for fear of our mission failing - All Hail Gwern"""". The initial aim failed, they never were able to reach the roof; however, their banner was slung over a nearby house for all to see.

Also, on 12th December 2010, a middle-aged man was seen sprinting away from elderly people with several teenagers following and aiding him. On his shirt, he was revealed to be sporting the words """"Gwern"""". 

Now, we have strong suspicions that you are this Gwern person, and we have every intention of arriving at the truth. We will be in contact if we arrive at any more information. Thankyou for your time.

I have removed the above because it is simply wrong, as mentioned in the previous talk page section.  We do not know which search terms it applies to, but certainly under google.co.uk this page is the first hit and Italian WP the second.

The conclusions of User 84 above may be correct, but would be WP:OR and so cannot be used in the article.  The request may be significant in some other article, such as the Right to be forgotten or Wikipedia articles, but without more information it is not relevant here.

First of all, reverting your edit wasn't a challenge to whether or not the information was correct. It was purely based on the lack of a citation. Wikilinks are not acceptable substitutions for inline citations. Each article must be able to stand on its own set of references and not rely on a wikilink to another article's reference. Refer to WP:CITE for more information. Secondly, comparing the flags and drawing a conclusion – no matter how reasonable and obvious it might be – can be considered a form of original research which is not permitted on Wikipedia. Citing a reliable source that supports the analogy alleviates the concern. It also helps us establish the significance of the information as it relates to the topic. Without that verification, it may be a trivial observation that doesn't necessarily belong in this article (see WP:DUE). As for your """"sky is blue"""" analogy, it's an apples-to-oranges comparison. Take for example the statement that """"the Eiffel Tower is in Paris"""". This is widely accepted fact that doesn't require research, and therefore doesn't require a citation. However, the statement that """"Gustave Eiffel designed the Eiffel Tower"""" would need a citation, although it is easily verifiable. It may be hard to see the difference, but the rule of thumb is when you think it may be challenged, it's best to err on the side of caution and include a citation.   """,0.0

 Wikipedia's lying liars & their lies...  http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html 

There are some regular writers on Wikipedia who knowingly engage in personal attacks and deletions (even of links) of anyone who explains the connection between Edward Bellamy and his cousin Francis Bellamy (author of the pledge of allegiance) and National Socialism. It is behavior that breaks Wikipedia's rules. What kind of people cover-up for Nazis and that horrid ideology?

Many regular writers on Wikipedia are lying liars and the lies they tell include the top media cover-ups. They cover up many historic photos of the Pledge of Allegiance http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html that reveal its original straight-arm salute.  They cover up the fact that the author of the Pledge of Allegiance (Francis Bellamy), and his cousin and cohort (Edward Bellamy), were National Socialists and supported the """"Nationalism"""" movement, the """"Nationalist"""" magazine, the """"Nationalist Educational Association,"""" their dogma of """"military socialism,"""" and Edward inspired the """"Nationalist Party.""""  They cover up the Pledge's straight-arm salute as the origin http://rexcurry.net/pledge1.html of the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis). As part of the cover up, they perpetuate the myth http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html that the straight-arm salute was from ancient Rome.  They cover up discoveries by the historian Rex Curry.  The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html showing the evolution of the gesture. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html is an extended military salute. A mnemonic device is the swastika (""""Hakenkreuz"""" in German).   Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent """"S"""" letters for their """"socialism.""""  Hitler altered his own signature http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html to use the same stylized """"S"""" letter for """"socialist."""" Wikipedia's liars cover up for the swastika http://rexcurry.net/swastikanews.html and its use as a sick socialist symbol. Wikipedia's liars cover up for the National Socialist German Worker's Party http://rexcurry.net/swastikamedia.html by overuse of the hackneyed shorthand """"Nazi.""""  Many Wikipedia posters are liars in that there was no """"Nazi Party"""" because it was actually the """"National Socialist German Workers' Party"""" and the party members did not call themselves """"Nazis"""" nor the """"Nazi Party.""""    The term """"Nazi"""" developed from slang using the first syllable in the German pronunciation of the """"National Socialist German Workers' Party.""""  In that sense, the author of the Pledge of Allegiance was a """"Nazi"""" too, in that the term means """"National Socialist.""""  The term """"Nazi"""" is also used to hide the National Socialist dogma behind the Pledge of Allegiance, its original gesture, and the National Socialist German Workers' Party.   

Wikipedia's liars use the term """"Nazi"""" and the misnomer """"Nazi Party"""" to cover-up the horrors of socialism. Wikipedia's liars cover up the the socialist trio of atrocities and and their socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part): 62 million people were slaughtered under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 35 million were slaughtered under the Peoples' Republic of China; 21 million were slaughtered under the National Socialist German Workers' Party. They cover up the fact that socialists helped start WWII with the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics together  http://rexcurry.net/socialistwar.html as allies in 1939. They cover up for and are deniers of the socialist Wholecaust, http://rexcurry.net/mediacoverup.html of which the monstrous Holocaust was a part.

Liars on Wikipedia repeat common lies http://rexcurry.net/mediapledge.html of the media. http://rexcurry.net/socialistmedia.html

Wikipedia should not be cited for support because it is no different than quoting various anonymous sources who have no knowledge of the topic http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html or who have lies to spread about the topic.

The Wikipedia article for the """"Roman salute"""" used to be complete disinformation, deliberately maintained by liars who tried to perpetuate myths.  Here is an excerpt of what Wikipedia used to carry: """"The Roman salute is a closed finger, flat-palm-down hand raised at an angle (usually 45 degrees) and was used by the Roman Republic.

Valid questions I guess. I'll take them point by point.

Awards: There are Barn Stars Wikipedians give to each other. You don't need to have any particular background to give one; though it is civil to not take one unless awarded )

Talk pages are not for chit-chat but you can write back here for any queries on the project.

The email link is generally on the left hand side table of the page (the third link from bottom). You can always use the code http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:EmailUser/Wifione to email me. Replace my name with any user's you might wish to email. However, in my case, I prefer the talk page discussions rather than email (no offence meant; it's a preference I hold while communicating with anybody).

Whenever you might wish to save a page, there's a diff method to do it so you can save the links properly. Using diffs, you get a perma-link to your version of the page. You could also go to the History link of the Help Page (or any page for that matter) and save any of the past versions of the page that contains your changes. For example, http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:New_contributors'_help_page&oldid;=348997206 is one possible perma-link to a version you might wish to save.

Hope that answers your questions. Like I mentioned before, feel free to ask me or any help desk member for help whenever. Kind regards.  ―Œ ♣Łeave Ξ мessage♣ """,0.0

"When I tackled this article, most all of it was a copy and paste from a 'mandobanjo' website. It is not laid out very well, tends to ramble and does not stick to the subject of mandolins. Anyhow, to do my part, I replaced a section in the history part. I believe it gives a succinct account of the mandolin's origin. The facts- names, places and years- are footnoted. Afterwards, It became apparent that the beginning of the article had to be re-written since there was really no definition of a mandolin. So I did this (footnoted also). Now as for the question left in the sandbox regarding mandolinos and mandoras, I will leave it to another to rewrite the definitions and histories of those instruments. When that is done, there will be no need to add to the mandolin's definition to try to expain why it is different from these similiar instruments.

I participated in the AFD discussion, but this is not my specialism.

The proper whay to dispute the closure of an AFD is a deletion review, but that is not what has been done.  Having decided that the outcome was to Keep, you should be protecting the full text of the article, not the redirect, and I would therefore suggest that you revert to the full article and protect that.  During that period of protection, discussion can take place on its talk page as to what should happen.  That is difficult while it is a redirect, becasue of the automatic transfer to the redirect destination.  I know how to get around that but others may not.

If Dayewalker, or anyone, is so concerned about their gender identification, and they are not an idiot, they will use a prefix like """"Mr."""" or """"Ms."""" Dayewalker has not said anything about it and it is off topic to the discussion.

Thanks for the 'typo fix' suggestion.  It certainly makes things simpler for me.  As for your other admonitions, concerning my responses to this person Hoary, I have been attempting to improve the article via a constructive colloquy with the editor Æµ§œš¹.  This Hoary person appears get his or her orgasmic jollies making asinine slurs and commentary that does not address the subject of Ebonics nor the inconsistencies in his or her logic.  I have verbally cleaned this person Hoary’s clock and yet this person Hoary keeps coming back for more.  Clearly this person Hoary loves the sadomasochistic verbal exchanges that he or she has invited and is having with me.  You would do better to make your admonitions to this Hoary person because I will not tolerate ‘dog whistle’ insults and racial slurs from Hoary, you or anyone else.  So you just block my edits all you want. Blocking my edits won’t make the inaccuracies and outright lies that Wikipedia is disseminating on the subject of Ebonics accurate or true.   If this person Hoary wants to discuss Black English or African American Vernacular English he or she should take his or her discussion to the Wikipedia Black English or African American Vernacular English section or page.  Ebonics is not Black English, African American Vernacular English or any other appellation that implies inherently that the language of descendants of enslaved Niger-Congo Africans is a dialect of English and genetically akin to the Germanic language family to which English belongs.  If you do not understand this fact then why was the Wikipedia African Diaspora project initiated? You should have called it the Black Anglo Saxon Diaspora Project instead.  But then, there would have to be historical linguistic evidence that Black Anglo Saxons brought Early Modern Black English, African American Vernacular English dialects to colonial America from somewhere in Germanic Europe.

"""[outdent]David,  I have tried in the nicest possible way to tell you that the majority of the text you are so set on using is not suitable as an encyclopaedia article. Copyvio or no, anything that builds up to soliciting money and indeed actually explicitly  requests  donations going so far as to give the bank details is not going to last five minutes. If all the time an effort you have expended trying to get the copyvio undeleted had instead been spent pulling together a new article it would all be done and dusted by now. I repeat my previous advice: base an article on Sport England. 

I'm also not sure whether you have been following the conversation on George's talk if not you might consider hopping over there as my question has been answered and it has been confirmed that as far as Wikipedia is concerned the text is still not released to GFDL. You'll also notice that your conflict of interest has been raised as a concern; personally I think that it is manageable, although Wikipedia does generally discourage people from editing on subjects they are personally connected with as we recognise that this does make it hard to remain neutral. The general rule of thumb is that if a topic is notable enough for inclusion then likely an uninvolved editor will be along soon enough to create an article about it. 

On the question of the image. I presume from looking at your talk page that you are referring to the (separately deleted) logo. This is entirely separate from the article and from reading what George says I understand that you have released it under GFDL. I would first ask you to think again very carefully about the implications of this as usually logos remain copyrighted and are used under a strict fair-use rationale. It is rarer than hens teeth that any organisation would relinquish their rights to their own logo/identity and release it for others to do with what they wish - are you confident for example that your board properly understand what this means and are entirely comfortable with it? However, if this really is the case then all you need to do is upload it (by clicking """"Upload file"""" on the menu on the left) making sure that you attribute the correct licensing and source information - the upload page will walk you through this. 

Finally on a housekeeping note could I ask that you not start a new thread every time you post here on this subject. You'll see that I have been moving your posts up under the one heading to keep the conversation together. Cheers,  talk

Um well, absence of research isn't research evidence of absence. There's no severely affected patients in that lot and they were only exercised modestly with regard to their illness status; the more sufferers push themselves the more aggravated symptoms and weakness should be. The sort of people who apply for exercise testing are not likely to be already on the verge of a relapse or struggling to cope at work (or even at home). If some of them have practical help or accomodating family they would do worse in the same tests without it. Gosh, no mention of exertional insomnia even.

Most of these studies aren't looking into a variety of somatic symptoms or even pain, only fatigue and functional strength (though the latter's good enough a demonstration of worsening after exercise for me. At the end of the day it's objective measures are most helpful).  If good evidence is totally lacking you have to use next best evidence, with caveats. 

You miss out a major notable source of good evidence in all the ME studies (and synonymous diagnoses) before c. 1988 or the 80's, for instance papers by Acheson, Gilliam, Galpine, Innes, Compston, Wallis et al.  This is after all, where exercise intolerance and severe multi-system symptoms were first described and recognised as a cardinal feature in non-remitting cases.  

There should also be some orthostasis studies. There's also Peckerman's heart studies, Les Simpson's trigger finger study, the Da Costa study, and so on. Though they might not be focussing on symptoms the sort and extent of findings likely gives indirect suppport to the extend and breadth of symptoms.

 Attempt at close of old RfC 

That is, the RfC listed on Archive 4 of this talk page, """"RfC: Does the article minimize the centrality of India to the notion of caste?"""" That the discussion wasn't closed earlier is of little surprise: it is long, it is technical, and the older it gets the less appetizing it gets: such discussions are very much not like Parmigiano-Reggiano. In fact, the discussion is so long that you'll have to accept the general conclusions I think I was able to draw without my being able to point at each and every individual comment supporting it. What I, as a non-Hundi-Indian currently middle-class college professor, conclude, are the following points:
Scholarly consensus appears to be that the caste system is still of the greatest importance to Hindu India; vice versa, discussions of the caste system in secondary and tertiary scholarly sources note the centrality of Hindu India to the very concept of """"caste"""".
Scholarly and especially less scholarly discussions on the concept of caste in other societies, esp. those outside SE Asia, mostly seem to use the term in the """"broader"""" sense signaled in various places in the RfCas a convenient shorthand for """"social stratification"""" and such. I note also that the application of the term """"caste"""" to some other cultures, popular until the 1970s and perhaps after, has now come under (academic) scrutiny and criticism.
Considering those two points, I conclude that it is 
The 1 September 2012 version of the article does suffer from OR and some coatracking; the current version is much better in that respect, though far from perfect. Note, for example, the very loose use of the word """"caste"""" in this newspaper article to warrant the inclusion of Cagot. As it turns out, there are sources """"comparing"""" their segregation to that of the Indian caste system: such a comparison is perhaps valid, but does not itself warrant calling them a caste.

Allow me a few observations and suggestions.
""""Caste"""" should (and this is supported in the RfC) include extensive discussion of the situation in India.
Examples from other cultures (some of which well established and verified in the current version of the article and associated main articles) must of course be thoroughly verified; an article from The Independent cannot suffice for what is, after all, an encyclopedic article.
I believe it is imperative (and comments in the RfC and elsewhere in the talk page archives support this) to come to a clarification of terms. The current lead does some of that already, but a separate section is warranted. Etymology should be the least important part of such a section; more important is a history of the usage of the termnot to be able to list every example of its usage, but rather to sketch the attractiveness of the paradigm to scholars of various periods, an attractiveness that has by now lost some of its currency. Parts of the lead of the 1 September 2012 version point to that as well; what's important is to delineate the term and its currency. Fowler&Fowler; cites Balkin in the RfC (""""social stratification in the United States does not really match the technical definition of caste ... caste is at best an effective hyperbole"""") and it's precisely that kind of research and criticism that need to be used here.
Sourcing should continue to be scrutinizedin Caste system in India, I read """"Caste is neither unique to Hindu religion nor to India; caste systems have been observed in other parts of the world, for example, in the Muslim community of Yemen, Christian colonies of Spain, and Japan"""", with one reference possibly very outdated (1972) and another a newspaper article from the New York Times. This is an article in which Wikipedia's crowdsourcing """"hey it's in the paper let's add it"""" needs to be held in check.

In all, I believe this was an interesting discussion in which the participants are perhaps closer to consensus than they thought. It is clear that there is no consensus that the article is redundant to Caste system in India etc.; it's clear also that there is consensus that the article should be much more focused than the 1 September 2012 version was, and that India must occupy a position of great(er) importance. In various places various quantified suggestions were made; I cannot comment on those numbers. I sensed some hesitance at perhaps """"borrowing"""" material from Caste system in Indiawell, if that's where good content on the concept of caste, its history, and its usage can be found, that's where you go.

 Korean article template 

Hi, thanks for your question.  Sorry I'm so late getting back to you.  Life on and off Wikipedia has been full of all sorts of unexpected hecticity...  Anyway, the Korean article template. 

The idea behind the template is pretty simple.  The basic idea is that every article should have the following, unless there is some reason to the contrary:
 a relevant """"See also"""" section, 
 at least one relevant Korea-related category, and
 a name table.  
 Template:Korean on the Talk page.

In more detail...
The """"See also"""" section should include a link to the List of Korea-related topics  (LKRT), and anything else that's obviously relevant but not linked in the article text.  If you prefer, you can just put in the LKRT link and let someone else add the others.  If you want to add more, here's the rule I've been following:  look in each category of which the article is a member.  If that category has a main article (like Korea in Category:Korea), then that main article should be linked  either from the text, or from the See also section.  The same for parent categories, within reason.  Here's an example:  Munmu of Silla is a member of the categories Silla and Korean rulers.  Thus, the articles Silla and Rulers of Korea are linked in the article text.  Those two categories are part of Category:Korean history and Category:Korean people.  Thus, History of Korea is linked in the See also section, and so is List of Koreans (well, it is now).   Both of those are members of Category:Korea, hence the link to the LKRT.  
You can find a complete (?) list of Korea-related categories at List of Korea-related topics#Categories.  Or just start at Category:Korea and work your way down.
Template:Koreanname noimage is fine for the vast majority of articles.  Cut and paste Template talk:Koreanname noimage#Syntax and fill in the blanks.  All Korean name tables require you to specify at least these four variables: hangul, hanja, rr, and mr.  """"Rr"""" stands for Revised Romanization of Korean, and """"mr"""" stands for McCune-Reischauer Romanization.  If you don't know what should go in these fields, just leave them blank  however, at a minimum the hangul should be provided (that allows other editors to verify the article and identify the other name-related information).  You can request help on the Korea-related notice board.  
This one's easy.  Just paste {{Korean}} onto the top of the talk page.  Done!

Most of our existing articles should already conform to this, since we just finished a housekeeping sweep in June.  But there are more new ones coming in every day...

I've also taken to adding a """"Wish list"""" to the talk pages of new/inactive articles, identifying 2 or 3 things that the article is lacking.  Hopefully this will help other contributors see where they can help.   (Of course, if I can contribute the information myself, I do so).

I hope this isn't all too overwhelming.  Your excellent work so far is much appreciated. 

Cheers,

 Well, in a perfect world it would depend on the sourcing. As it stands? You could say it goes both ways. The fact that it was undisputed before 2004 or whenever could mean that Larry Sanger was the co-founder. It could also mean that Jimbo didn't see it that way but didn't want to be a dick until things got strained between them. It could be that Jimbo didn't CARE as long as Larry was helping Wikipedia, but now that he's running Citizendium and is making all these loud noises about how his will be teh bettars, Jimbo sees no reason to allow Larry a false prop. That's what I mean about how they have to work it out. The only NPOV way to handle it is to state the bald facts: that Larry Sanger asserts he is a cofounder, which Jimmy Wales says is untrue.

I am afraid to state the known historical facts because but each side believes my idea is the POV of the other.

Thanks.   Believe it or not in the real world I think that we think mostly alike on this.   I'm for the societal normalizaion of homosexuality.   I'm not for the nasty tactics used by some folks who feel that way, including branding anybody who feels otherwise as having a phobia.    And such work against themselves.     But in a Wikipedia sense, such opinions are not relevant.  Two definitions of the word exist, and one of them is sky-is-blue obviously controversial. The problem with the article is that, as a part of a POV quest, it pretends that the more controversial """"all opposition is phobia"""" definition is the ONLY definition. That would be just a difference of opinion but the more severe problem there is the nasty tactics used by a certain cadre there against people who do not agree with their quest.  I think that they have set the record for the amount of bogus tactics and bogus accusations used against a fellow editor.  And when I see people using such tactics against people in Wikipedia to further their purposes, I really see red.

And no I do not think that you are misguided.  I think that the real world you and your thoughts and efforts are right on track and admirable. And in Wikipedia you are a kind and thoughtful editor.

CBDunkerson,
I hope this comment on my own talk page is not considered intervention. (I see I've been unblocked.)

I did not mean to suggest that MONGO was purposely inserting information as part of his job. The only reason I said """"I would not be surprised"""", is because this has been going on for a while now and Wikipedia has not stopped it. What else am I to think? (Although I admit to not being familiar with Wikipedia's procedures.) Still, that comment by me is nothing compared to what MONGO's been getting away with.

(Also just noticed this btw.)

Wikipedia is supposed to be NPOV which is why MONGO should steer clear of the 9/11 pages.

An examination of the exchanges between MONGO and myself here is a good example:

MONGO seems content with personal attacks: """"who cares how many misguided folks there are"""".

His comments are clearly ad hominem personal attacks towards me, and many others.

The following, from this page, shows he's content with namecalling as well. I removed an external link to a namecalling site, MONGO reverts me leaving the following statement: I like this weblink...it summaries things quite well

I apologize for any insinuations on my part, but also must stress my own attempts at a NPOV.

I'm sure we all agree, from MONGO's own statements here that he is neither apologetic nor neutral:

""""The POV pushers that try to add nonsense to the articles related to the 9/11 events have been told repeatedly that the vast majority of their """"contributions"""" to those article violated numerous policies. This doesn't seem to stop them. This editor I blocked routinely reverts those that support the concensus verison and yes, conspiracy theorists is what they are...they are not researchers. Simply put, and I won't apologize for this not being more civil, I will continue to block POV pushers that disrupt the discussion pages and the articles with nonsense. Two other admins responded to the unblock request and did not unblock this editor. I then moved the early parts of this conversation from an article talk page to here for all to see. It is ludicrus to assume that I was doing anything other than to ensure that the POV pushers of nonsense know that there is a limit to the level of disruption that needs to be tolerated.""""

Hello, . Please don't use the word """"important"""" when talking about notability, as you did at WP:HD#Zeeshan haider.

Here is a poem that details something I think you'll find educational.  After checking over your behavior on Wikipedia a little bit, I think you might be interested in what it's like to have a penis.  Your incessant edit warring (that you childishly deny), and your infuriating, relentless self-importance are all the evidence that I need to conclude that you either a) don't have a penis (much like Gwen Gale) or b) possess such a small penis that it just doesn't count.  Anyway, enjoy this poem - just for you.

I'll tell you a short poem; I'll try to make it quick. The subject is quite simple: The joy of having a dick.

Penises are super things; Daedalus969 should be jealous. An organ surrounded by sensitive skin. That's smooth and rarely hairless

It starts to grow dramatically, When you're about thirteen. Your testicles on either side; Your willy in between.

It dangles neatly down below; Soft, obedient and loyal. At the slightest hint of lust, It's ready to uncoil.

It often has a mind all of its own; It's like a wild untamed beast. It squirms and writhes and stretches out; When you expect it least.

Sometimes, yes, it misbehaves; Erecting when it shouldn't. A bumpy train ride sets it off; Just when you wish it wouldn't.

And during the summer, wearing little, sunning on the beach. The slightest sight of shaking boobs Makes it squirm just like a leech.

Handle it with love and care; For it can give great pleasure. Has it grown since last weekend? And when did you last measure?

Some people fret about its size; They give it lots of thought. Is thirteen inches long enough? It makes guys quite distraught.

They peek across in urinals, To compare and try to see But if another glances back at them. There's no way they can pee.

Masturbating is a sin; That's what some folk believe. But those are just old wives' tales; Cuz it really can relieve.

Without this fabulous organ, No shag would be complete. Lesbians will try their best; But must admit defeat.

It has to main bodily functions I'm sure you'll all agree. To start a whole new life and of course daily to pee

But I think the thing that's marvellous; About that one eyed brute. Is that when its trying to procreate, It knows which fluid to shoot

And always it remains with you; Until you're old and frail. Don't take it out in public though, or you'll be thrown in jail.

And so to summarise I'd say with certainty, that every male loves his little friend But girls, no matter what we do, Please don't fold, spindle mutilate and NEVER NEVER Bend!!!",0.0

Spelling. That's so 20th Century, its called typos and it has nothing to do with spelling. All I want is for the NPOV tag to stay, its a reasonable request and its not asking too much as the article is POV. Best wishes. Cheers for the heads up re AN/I,  
Bah.  Spelling is important when the medium being used is written. )
I don't understand why you are insisting on having a separate NPOV template instead of allowing the issue to be noted in the """"Multiple issues"""" template that is already in the article.  Can you please explain?   

Oh I dont doubt the importance of spelling, its typing I find difficult. This article is so POV, I do intend to seek out some other refs but NPOV demands both sides are prevsented and as I made clear on the talk that isnt happening in this article. That some rascist editors are targetting it (eg the banned fourdee) is ample evidence of that. I am baffled as to why anyone would remove the NPOV tag, I never do that before resolving the issue,  
Please answer the question: Why do you insist on a separate NPOV template when the other one communicates the exact same idea but with less clutter?   

I removed the blue tag. I want the orange tag there and I have fully explained my reasons. The article presents one side of an argument and not the other. I dont understand what the controversy is as I removed the unnotable blue tag,  
No, I'm afraid that you haven't answered the question.  I don't see a need to for multiple templates when one easily suffices.   
Nor do I. That is why I have removed the blue tag. An orange NPOV tag was created for a reason and it should stay as an orange tag. What is the problem?

 Employee Free Choice Act 

I made some edits to your additions to the United States House Committee on Education and Labor article and the main Employee Free Choice Act article. My chief concerns was the way the markup was described. The lead in that stated the full markup included """"numerous amendments proposed by Republican committee members that were rejected by the majority"""" could be interpreted as violating NPOV, even though it references factual statements. The press release it cites from committee Republicans is far from an objective opinion on the bills merits or the conduct of the markup. That being said, Republican objections to the bill and the way the markup was conducted are reasonable to include in the article. I have rewritten those sections, keeping the intent of what is being said in place while minimizing potential POV issues.

In addition, I fixed the link to the Congressional Record statement by Rep. Miller, as the temporary link from Thomas no longer works. I created a template {{USCongRec}} that provides permanent links to pages in the Congressional Record. Also, {{USBill}} is a useful template for creating permanent links to legislative text which avoids potential broken links on Thomas. """,0.0

"Research shows that one of the most prominent characteristics of infant directed speech is the wider opening of the mouth that is present in those using infant directed speech versus adult directed speech.  This differences occurs especially in vowels.  Vocal pitch is also heightened during infant directed speech and research indicates vowels are spoken with the highest pitch when infant directed speech is used.  The horizontal positioning of the lips in infant directed speech does not differ significantly from positioning used in adult directed speech.  Instead, the only observed difference remains in vertical lip positioning.  By making the opening of the lips larger, infants are more likely to focus on the face of the speaker.  Research suggests that the larger the opening of the lips during infant directed speech, the better infants will understand the message being conveyed due to the additional visual cues available.  The intensity of speech, however, does not differ from that used in adult directed speech contrary to popular belief.   

Infant directed speech does not only include the characteristics of high pitched speech and elongated syllables, but also incorporates visual body movements that assist in conveying meaning of language to infants.  One monumental visual aspect of infant directed speech is the movement of the lips.  In addition, head movements are used to emphasize various syllables within language production.  These visual cues provide infants the additional information needed to perform accurate speech discrimination during language development.  Further, visual cues allow infants to discriminate speech differences in environments in which they cannot rely on their hearing, such as in noisy environments.  The auditory and visual aspects of infant directed speech do not exist independently, however.  Infants rely equally on both methods of understanding and as development continues, infants strengthen the link between these two important categories.  

It must be considered that although infant directed speech features marked characteristics, it may not only be these characteristics aiding in development of language for children.  Due to the visual cues used  by caregivers in this method of communication, infants are more highly motivated to engage in communication.  Because infants are willing to participate in this process, caregivers are able to make significant progress through the use of infant directed speech.  

It is often assumed that infants are interested in the properties of infant directed speech and play a passive role in this interaction.  However, research indicates that infants are not only attracted to the practice itself but to people who engage in infant directed speech.  Through this practice, infants are able to determine who positive and encouraging caregivers will be in their development.  When infants use infant directed speech as a determinant of acceptable caregivers their cognitive development seems to thrive because they are being encouraged by adults who are invested in the development of the given infants.",0.0

Well, my point is that Navarre (for example) has indoubtly links to the Basque Country (some parts do speak basque, some historical links...) and even have another association much related to the IRL called EUSKARA KULTUR ELKARGOA. But that doesn't mean we should link both regions in the same basket. The navarrese government has never expressed any intention of reducing its own political or social identity, the same way Andorra, Balears or Valencia haven't either. Participating in a single cultural project such as the IRL, doesn't mean that suddenly those territories have renounced to their own identities (so close or so distanct to the Catalan proper). We are not even explaining that it is just a part of the population which may be considered as catalans... We are not talking about the spanish-speakers (around 50% of all the inhabitants of these regions), the french-speakers or simply all the foreigners living for years in these territories:

Balearic Islands: 21% of the total pop. (that's 224K)
Catalonia: 15% of the total pop. (that's 1,1 million)
Valencia: 17,7% of the total pop. (that's 866K)

They sum up as 2,2 million people who don't consider themselves neither Catalan nor Valencian nor Balearic. Then, add the national population which don't speak a word of the language (2,6 million link) or even the ones who can speak it but don't use it as primary language (it roses up to around 50% of the total pop.)...

So, because of that, I keep thinking that putting ALL the inhabitants of these territories (or just the name of the regions) in the same basket is so so so """"dangerous""""... We are talking about figures ranging between 30% and 50% of people who may have a much doubtly catalanity... And that's a LOT of people. MauritiusXXVII (Aut Disce, Aut Doce, Aut Discede!). """,0.0

"The feather will land first!! (and please don't include this in the article). Let's do a calculation. The mass of the Earth is about 1024 times bigger than the mass of the hammer. Therefore, the acceleration of the Earth is 1024 times smaller than the acceleration of the hammer, so if the hammer falls through 1 m, the Earth will move 10-24 m during the same time. Such short distances, which correspond to an energy of 100000 TeV, are not probed even by the most energetic particle accelerators! Let's now do another calculation. Suppose we're dropping the feather. The hammer, which is presumably on the ground, attracts the feather with its gravity. The additional acceleration of the feather is given by GM/r2, where M is the mass of the hammer and r is the distance from the feather to the hammer.

I assume good faith on your part, UserQuiddity, because you have always been a gentleman. Accordingly either you are mistaken, or Wikipedia is subject to easy fandalism, because the facts, as I know them are substantially different from your presentation. The page in question is Jewish Bolshevism, which is a so called noun + adjetive expression (according to Wikipedians). The fact is that those who explain or justify the hatred of Jews are crackpots and Antisemites. My position is simple: Jewish Bolshivism has only an antisemitic meaning, interpretation, usage, justification, etc. I am not responsible for the fact that that Draius/red (whatever his difficult to remember name is) user deduced that I have insulted him. The insult was his own deduction. I did not hurl at him any insult. And that term popsucker is just my paraphrase of the other dofficult Wiki word for a Wikipedia who disguises his identity. I am not allowed to name any of the people I suspect - what's that word, I don't know, and I do not wish to waste my time looking for it - it sounds something like suckpoper - can you help me out on this? Also, I can no longer locate the Wikipedia linked expression Don't be a dick. Can you please provide me with the link to it. Also, it would be helpful if you located that link to that """"popsucker"""" term. It was user:Noetica  who suspected a pop-x to be disguising himself as such. And

"""

As I'm sure many of you have surmised, there is something going on behind the scenes to which most editors of Wikipedia are not privy. My purpose here today is to expose it. In doing so, you may be tempted to minimize the problem by vilifying David Gerard or Carbonite, but their actions are only part of the surface manifestation, and penalizing them will only accentuate the dilemma. Finding fall-guys to punish will not fix the problem because the underlying problem is the system of punishment.

Systems of punishment
On Jpgordon's talk page, we see Carbonite punish the administrator with a forced """"time out."""" In response, Jpgordon leaves a message on Carbonite's talk page saying, """"Good call."""" Jpgordon's subservience to the system of punishment is directly evident in this example. Methods of indirectly empowering systems of punishment also exist.

We can disagree with Carbonite's methods while enabling them at the same time by acknowledging Carbonite's ability to control our will. But, does Carbonite have the innate ability to control our will, or do we grant him that power? Obviously, Carbonite cannot coerce us without our agreeing to allow him that authority. Our mind is our own, and our will is based purely on the systems we acknowledge.

When we buy into a system of punishment, as many of us have at Wikipedia, we are purchasing the whole package. It come complete with vandals, disrespect, flame wars, and content ultimately controlled by a very few individuals with little or no prescriptive editing experience.

Prescription
Language requires prescription. This is evident with a little thought-experiment involving two extremes. If you could only communicate with words that remained the same indefinitely after they are coined, communication would be entirely possible. However, in the opposite extreme, where official definitions instantly amended whatever meaning every disparate context assumed, propaganda and """"misuse"""" would soon render that language ineffectual.

Within the intended construct of Wikipedia, we don't have to understand how strong singular definitions empower a civilization. The Darwinism of thousands of disparate editors and competing ideas will naturally lead to a prescriptive definition. In areas of Wikipedia where we don't have top-down control of content, this is exactly what happens. Unfortunately, systems of punishment have become the rule at Wikipedia instead of the exception. Our love for this project creates expectations for its potential, but the fear of not reaching these expectations allows others to control us, closes our eyes to corruption and content control, and ultimately destroys the thing we love.

 Murder of a deposed Sheikulislam in 1821/ was this Haci Halil Efendi? 

There is information in some sources about a deposed Sheikhulislam who was travelling in 1821 to Mecca with his family for pilgrimage, it was the time of the Greek war of Independence and their ship was captured by Orthodox Christians of Hydra and everyone on board was killed. The source state that this Sheikhulislam was actually pro-Greek but still got murdered. Unfortunately the name of the Sheikhulislam is not mentioned, is it possible that this person would be Haci Halil?

Has anybody more information about Haci Halil Efendi? The source claims without sources that he was murdered in Constantinople by torture. It states that he was deposed because he tried to prevent a massacre of Greeks, but we also need Turkish/Ottoman sources.
The article needs more sources and investigation.  

The following is written in Massacres during the Greek Revolution.

""""Another similar massacre took place in the island Hydra, one of the most important Aegean islands. Besides the atrocities committed against the local Muslims in the island, two hybrid brigs captured a Turkish ship laden with a valuable cargo, and carrying a number of passengers. Among these was a recently deposed Sheik-ul-Islam, or patriarch of the Orthodox Muslims, who was said to be going to Mecca for pilgrimage. It was his efforts to prevent the cruel reprisals which, at Constantinople, followed the news of the massacres in Peloponnese, which brought him into disfavor, and caused his exile.W. Alison Phillips, The War of Greek Independence, p.66 There were also several other Turkish families on board. British historian of the Greek revolt, W. Alison Phillips noted: The Hydriots murdered them all in cold blood, helpless old men, ladies of rank, beautiful slaves, and little children were butchered like cattle. The venerable old man, whose crime had been an excess of zeal on behalf of the Greeks, was forced to see his family outraged and murdered before his eyes...""""W. Alison Phillips, p. 67""",0.0

"""==Additions to Origins: The Subjects==
I feel that it would be effective, either in its own section or within Origins, to expand on the audiences that ethnographic films are geared towards.  The article now seems to focus well on the aesthetic and historical context and the scientific research and study that can be done.  However, it is only slightly mentioned through  """"Nai, the Story of a !Kung Woman"""" on how the actual subjects or indigenous tribes react-to and can utilize this film.

In order to expand on this topic, I was thinking of a rough statement like this would be ideal:

Indigenous tribes and people often have clearly defined practical reasons for participating in ethnographic films.  Such reasons include creating a record of their lives for future generations, warning authorities of potential problems, exchanging cultural information with other cultural groups and educating dominant cultures.Aufderheide, Patricia. Documentary Film: A Very Short Introduction. Oxford University Press, 2007.  An ethnographic film by indigenous creators can also concentrate heavily on a particular movement towards indigenous activism.  The way an activist approach is accomplished is when filmmakers approach the issue with a tactic of openness, which ultimately no longer makes the camera a transparent object and instead an actor on stage that is allowed to be lead by its subjects.Aufderheide, Patricia.

Filiqurian has followed these rules. I feel like an exception is being made for PediaPress while Filiqurians being attacked when they actually ARE following the rules.

One of the articles I have contributed a great deal to is the solar system article, while PediaPress has distributerd without links to providing credit or the gfdl license. It even includes pictures that don't include the proper licenses. Give me a break. One of those pictures was even one that was created by the lab I scientific study lab that I work for.

 Kaballah and Tarot 

The article implies that Kaballah and Tarot weren't related until the 19th cent. occult movement. I assume that's a reference to the Golden Dawn. Or Papus. But that's more of an assumption than anything. The cards first appeared, albeit in a somewhat different format, at the same time and in the same place as a flowering of non-Jewish interest in Kaballah. 

I raise this here because 1) I'm not sure how to correct the article, 2) I'm a newbie and would rather not do harm in an attempt to do good, and 3) I'd like to see if anyone else has strong opinions.  

 
Tarot and Qaballah have a 1 to 1 correspondence, and are almost
certainly paralell descriptions of the same mythic archetypes.
The history presented here is propagandist christian; it assumes
that Tarot was started in Italy, which is patently culturacidal
because the cards are part of pagan European mysticism, and they
did all they could to kill off the pagans.
Italies versions were propagandist toy versions of the original,
copied without an understanding of the meanings and changed to suit
the assumptive interests of the new Italian art culture.

 """"1 to 1 correspondence"""" is one interpretation, but a poor one. Parallels between the Tarot and the Tree of Life have been drawn (Eliphas Levy?), but they do not parallel other components of the Qaballah, such as the texts on Gematria. While many neo-pagans have adopted and adapted the Tarot, I seriously doubt any kind of pagan origins (although I'd love to see evidence for such).  

 Could you offer any evidence for your statement of a Pagan predevelopment? The """"normal"""" knowledge about Tarot cards development in Italy lists various examples of really existing old playing cards called Trionfi and really existent documents which use this word Trionfi.  

 
yes, there is proof that the trionfi cards actually did exist.
No, there isn't proof that this is a verifiable point of origin.
Proof can be very hard to come by in a situation involving cultural
genocide, however, there are a variety of esoteric proofs and even easier to understand basic arguments.

The first of these is the simple question of sociology and anthropology. Okay, if Tarot is a product of Italian culture of that Time period, where out of that culture did those symbols derivate?
The answer is, they didn't and couldn't of, they were obviously
symbols from a system the Italians had no knowledge of.

 So YOU say, buddy. Can you please give us some proof that the Italians DIDN'T have any knowledge of tarot symbolism? And what symbolism! Empresses, chariots, the sun... the moon. A tower. All of it stuff with which Italians would have been completely and totally unfamiliar, huh?  Vince In Milan

Other """"proofs"""" as such hinge on increasingly more esoteric facts,
and, as weak an argument as the above sounds, if you know Tarot, it is a VERY sound argument as one starts to apply the basic principle
per card. The Tarot is OBVIOUSLY a wheel of the year mythic architecture, the Elementalist perspective would have been an anacronism in Italian culture of that time period.

new age noise, but another case of somebody who actually saw
the obvious;
http://www.psychicsahar.com/artman/publish/article_399.shtml

As a side note, Tarot suffered more than its sister system, the Tree
of life, which has also been revisionist histroied to start in the 13th century. Unlike Tarot, the proof of this is patently obvious to any who have studied esoteric judaism. The bibles symbols and images
are based on Qaballah, not the other way around. Everything is derivated in Judaism by virtue of the TREE, including even the hebrew
language. 

At the very least, we can show that the Trionfi is not the original Tarot by refering to the Tarot of the Bohemians.

You've only been on Wiki for a month and you have an adoption program? Am I missing something?   
Well, I do have 3300+ edits, and I'm trying to edit more on the mainspace more. Any comments? talk 
I think that this is ridiculous. You are not at all an experienced user, you have only 312 edits in mainspace, only one page move. Do you know the fair use policy, the naming conventions, the banning policy ? etc. I see that you want to become an admin when you'll have over 5000 edits, well, you should look closer at recent RFAs. By the way, some people are offended nowadays because some users think that Wikipedia is just another (curious) facebook, myspace, or RPG ... You should take this into account too. I don't mean to be offending either, I see that you encourage people to give their opinion (the review etc), I just give mine. Something is wrong too, why have you chosen this page to post your adoption program ? It's meant to be a user talk page (cf the corresponding policies/guidelines), it's not the community bulletin board. Back to the adoption program, I think that you should wait several months before working on this. If you wish, we can continue this discussion, somewhere else.  Talk 
 raises very valid points above. What is it you (RyRy5) are hoping to achieve here? And what do pages such as  and  have to do with improving the encyclopedia?  Most importantly, the following sort of edits appear to have more to do with inflating edit count than anything else: , , , , .

While I don't care about some pleasant humor (the BRC is quite acceptable), the sudden recent influx of cabals, most of them created by what I suspect are teenage editors, is completely unnecessary. The adoption is also premature. I don't care about the so-called """"edit-count pumping"""" edits, though; minor edits are plenty useful.

You realize, No September, that you're essentially giving in to trollery here?  John Kerry and George W Bush attract trolls, predictably.  Well, the solution they've come up with is pretty good; semi-protect, and put a trollery warning on the talk page.  Why was so much more censoring action done here, while allowing MONGO to edit without accountability and locking up the talk page and refusing to hear of the matter on his talk page, effectively giving him total control of the article?  This is not a """"value judgement"""" case; policy provides for a specific case just like this!

Do not edit or revert a temporarily protected page, except to add a protected page notice, a link to Wikipedia:Accuracy dispute or Wikipedia:NPOV dispute, or a similar disclaimer about the current state of an article, unless there is widespread agreement that the page was protected in violation of these policies.
Do not protect a page you are involved in an edit dispute over.
Admins should not protect pages in which they are involved. Involvement includes making substantive edits to the page (fixing vandalism does not count), or expressing opinions about the article on the talk page before the protection. Admin powers are not editor privileges — admins should only act as servants to the user community at large. If you are an admin and you want a page in an edit war in which you are somehow involved to be protected, you should contact another admin and ask them to protect the page for you. Not only is this the preferable method, it is also considered more ethical to do so as it helps reduce any perceived conflict of interest.
 Important Note: When a page is particularly high profile, either because it is linked off the main page, or because it has recently received a prominent link from offsite, it will often become a target for vandalism. It is not appropriate to protect pages in this case. Instead, consider adding them to your watchlist, and reverting vandalism yourself.
Why weren't these policies complied with?  This is not a special case; the policy provides for cases just like this.  WHy are you ignoring this, and why is this being ignored at the requests for unprotection?  Moreover, If MONGO is so innocent, why is he refusing to discuss it, unless he is mocking editors who raise concerns?""",0.0

"""::Just because a man says """"I have...axe..."""" (e.g. """"I have no axe to grind"""")  does not mean that he is threatening you with personal violence then, or that later if/when he has an axe that he is threatening to take it to a grinding wheel and then attack you, or that he is threatening to use an axe or knife or hatchet or anything on you, etc. If that is what you get out of that phrase, or every time the word “axe” or “cut” or “hammer,” etc., is spoken or written, you find yourself worried or uncomfortable, I think that you should discuss these concerns with someone you trust. The person(s) you trust can discuss these concerns with you and/or direct you to others with whom you can discuss these concerns further.

People, including you, commonly use even more colorful  expressions and lingo without the slightest intent to threaten someone  at least we all hope you are not intending to be threatening when you make commentds including an axe.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Queen_(band) If people are responding to you, when you say these things, in a manner that indicates that they are taking what you say as a threat, you may wish to discontinue saying such things, and, candidly, even all the more so if you are actually intending to make a threat.
 
If you are concerned that a particular phase that you feel has been directed at you is a threat, and you believe that you are in some danger, then the only responsible advice anyone can give to you is for you to contact the appropriate police authorities and report it to them. My personal opinion that you are completely wrong does not matter. It is an issue, for you, of safety. It is better that you bother the law enforcement authorities with matters that were not a threat to you (but that you felt were a threat), than to fail to report a real threat for fear that you are over-reacting. They will either provide you the help you need or arrange for that help. It may be that you are overreacting or reading more into what someone says. It may be that the help you need is not exactly of the type you think you might need. All that can be worked out in time. What is important first is that you are actually safe. What's really going on in the messages that you are reading is something that, if you are truly concerned for your safety, can be sorted out later.

 In response to Claude's last two posts.  Backwards of course.  Regarding NRMs - if you'll check the list, you'll see that Assemblies of God, Calvary Chapel, Foursquare, and CMA are all considered both NRMs and denominations.  Just a note.  Also true of the Vineyard Movement, of which there are many comparisons to GCA.  You're right that GCC doesn't like the denominational nametag,   but just like Vineyard many outsiders consider it to be and there is little actual semantic difference.  As far as what a movement is, a couple definitions I found were """"a diffusely organized or heterogeneous group of people or organizations tending toward or favoring a generalized common goal: the antislavery movement; the realistic movement in art."""" and """"An organized effort by supporters of a common goal: a leader of the labor movement.""""
 I say all that to say this.  Movement is a very ambiguous term, more appropriate to an idea.  You're right that GC does use the term frequently.  However, I think the best factual definition, and most suitable for our purposes and for accuracy within the title and intro, is """"GCAC is an association of churches"""".  That's what the AC in GCAC stands for.  Really, that's what we actually see in existence - churches.  Somehow we need to differentiate - I think we need to start with definiing the article as about an association of churches, because we have to pick a topic - that is one thing plaguing us at present as editors.  So let's start with something real, then trace the history of that association. and the present.
 I will re-edit the Today section.  It is not NPOV at present.  What I objected to was not the quote but rather your original sentence before it.  I was confused about the date, couldn't find it in your reference (I was in a hurry).  We need to focus on what we're doing here - we're putting facts up.  We don't need to interpret or extrapolate.  That quote from Bovenmeyer seems to be about  church leadership, with one sentence relating that to autonomy.  For that reason, while I think it should stay, it would be wrong to put that forth as the best description of the GC view of autonomy and congregational polity since neither of those is the topic.      Again, your statement isn't found in the quote.  The quote itself is fine, and appropriate - i don't see any reason that it needs a qualifier - as the quote i put above from the cong. polity article says, leadership/authority is a common integral part of cong. polity, and as we all have said there is no """"typical view"""" - if we're going to have cong. polity as a term in the GCA article, people need to go there and read it (also someone needs to put some serious work in on that article).  I don't have any problem with  deferring to leaders - i just want accuracy here.  Also note that there is a difference between an article in an official publication by one man and an official stance of the org (which is listed in several places), especially given the independence and autonomy of the churches within GCA.

"Indeed: “Learning curve.” I am amazed at how much learning I had to do in order to get the wiki privatized and fully operational.First off, I wanted to make an iron-clad-security main page, like ArbCom’s wiki. That wasn’t too terribly difficult but there is a gaping hole in MediaWiki’s security in the default installation whereby all uploaded files (generally images) in a completely private wiki can be directly accessed by anyone familiar with MediaWiki merely typing a URL path. That took some reading and trial & error. MediaWiki’s excuse is that “♬♩ MediaWiki is designed to be open to everyone, maaaan. It’s—like—about *openness*. ♬” The thing is, those who don’t care to think about security, wouldn’t mind if images cannot be viewed via intelligent URL typing. However, those making a private wiki who do care wouldn’t want them viewable by I.P.s.And then thumbnails of images wouldn’t work no matter what I did to LocalSettings.php file. Like many things, I would go to talk pages on MediaWiki and discover there have been many others wrestling with the same issues. It turned out that ImageMagick has been omitted from recent builds of MediaWiki. Moreover, installing ImageMagick isn’t a matter of dropping files and folders into the /wiki using FTP; it’s a Linux installer rpm and only the webmaster can do that.And, after all that is done, there are bunch of gotta-have templates like Template:!xt, Template:-, Template:-/doc, Template:Hilite, Template:Nbhyph, Template:Nowrap, and Template:Xt. I think I have all the gotta-haves now. I was the shepherding author/sponsor on a bunch of them so I’m fond of them.I can’t complain about *free* stuff. MediaWiki is an amazing product that few commercial interests could match for under $1500. I’ll take the poor documentation associated with open-source software any day.",0.0

My concept is Background, Game play (all the way to the end), Network and reaction (might have to be split depending on length, and Aftermath.  Cut out most of the present article.  The Jets were pretty upset about the officiating and were eventually fined by Rozelle, which had nothing to do with the television.

No problem. The archives are going to look a bit messy but at least we'll have a record of them.   Talk 
I care not about the mess.  Thanks.  I have a few images up, more coming but I have to get back on the road!  By the way, I saw a source that said that the 1968 AFL championship was to be played at the East Division Champ.  Alternating divisions.  The NFL did something similar for many years.  
I had a bit of a laugh out of this (snatched it off a 1962 ticket order form).  Ample restrooms?  I guess they were counting the ramps.  
Ha!   Talk 
I put a mention of ample restrooms in the image caption in the History article, and Jets fans should get a good laugh.  Images are up, I stopped because I did not want to crowd the article.  I'll keep uploading later.  I will substitute in the Namath shot, unless you have a better idea (from the four page newsletter, Jet Stream they used to send to season ticket holders, I think they did so into my tenure as a season ticket holder (since 1986).  
You have built up a very impressive collection and the article looks great! The images will help make it easier on the eyes for sure. The Namath shot is fine besides, he was an important part of the team's success and should be depicted. Some brief thoughts: After this season we'll have to re-visit the article and, in all liklihood, split it at the 90s, I would say. I'm still determined to capture the elusive photo of Rex in his element as I return to Foxboro in October, here's hoping my camera will function properly so we could add that to the article. We may also be able to grab something from the Commons for Sanchez if I can't capture him either.   Talk 
I was thinking about a split at 1969, right after the blockquote I just added.  The AFL material is more detailed.  Next time I go to a day game I'll bring my camera.  Maybe even a night.  
That's a good idea actually. Makes the most sense.   Talk

There is NO evidence in JEWISH sources that there EVER was a 'canon' in the Christian sense of the word. Most deduction is based on non-Jewish sources and modern academic research. Therefore you can not call TaNaKh a canon just so it can fall into the same definition as Christian works.

The making of humanity Robert Briffault Publisher G. Allen & Unwin ltd., 1919 Original from the University of California Digitized Oct 18, 2007
It must be admitted that, in recoil from the general conspiracy of silence of our histories, several writers who have sought to vindicate the claims of Arab culture have somewhat exaggerated the achievements of Arabian science. Against such loose panegyrics it has been objected, that Arab science produced no surpassing genius and no transcending discovery ; that it was derived from extraneous sources. That is substantially true, but entirely irrelevant. Arab astronomy did not forestall Copernicus or Newton, though without it there would have been no Copernicus and no Newton. Although the complexity of the Ptolemaic system was repeatedly criticized by Moorish astronomers, although Al-Zarkyal declared the planetary orbits to be ellipses and not circles, although the orbit of Mercury is in Al-Farani's tables actually represented as elliptical, although Muhammad Ibn Musa glimpsed in his works on Astral Motion and The Force of Attraction the law of universal gravitation, those adumbrations of the truth were not fruitful of any great reform. The only important facts brought to light by Arabian astronomy, the discovery of the movements of the sun's apogee by Al-Batani, and of the secondary variations of the moon's motion by Abu '1-Wafa, exercised no perceptible influence upon the course of research, and had to be rediscovered by Tycho. Ibn Sina is said to have employed an air thermometer, and1 Ibn Yunis certainly did use the pendulum for the measurement of time ; but neither of those devices, which were independently re- introduced by Galileo, can be counted as a contribution to the growth of science.

That, however, is entirely beside the point. The debt of our science to that of the Arabs does not consist in startling discoveries or revolutionary theories; science owes a great deal more to Arab culture, it owes its existence. The ancient world was, as we saw, pre-scientific. The astronomy and mathematics of the Greeks were a foreign importation never thoroughly acclimatized in Greek culture. The Greeks systematized, generalized and theorized, but the patient ways of investigation, the accumulation of positive knowledge, the minute methods of science, detailed and prolonged observation, experimental inquiry, were altogether alien to the Greek temperament. Only in Hellenistic Alexandria was any, approach to scientific work conducted in the ancient classical world. What we call science arose in Europe as a result of a new spirit of inquiry, of new methods of investigation, of the method of experiment, observation, measurement, of the development of mathematics in a form unknown to the Greeks. That spirit and those methods were introduced into the European world by the Arabs.
Is  Briffault's writing wp:npov? Not when cut and pasted, only when taken in context. The emphasis in this quote is mine, however wp:rs will show that systems and theories of science in the middle ages are those of Aristotle, Archimedes, Galen, Ptolemy, and Euclid. As for the spirit and methods we need a more neutral tone.",0.0

"Misrepresenting administrator scope 

Please take care not to misrepresent how administrators are expected to act, or any other policy in the future - administrators do not make content decisions. What you quoted was particular only to discretionary sanctions which are only applicable in certain arbitration cases. You view has therefore been moved again to the talk page.   

Please take care not to engage in misrepresentation - you are not outside of this dispute, and your quote was particular to discretionary sanctions. Administrators do not make content decisions. See below. Please also do not change my view - I suggest you revert your latest edit - failure to do so will result in administrator intervention for deliberate misrepresentation, misuse of the dispute resolution process and vandalism.   
 

You are welcome to your view, but you are not welcome to misrepresent administrator policy or to change my view.   

You have engaged in misrepresentation, perhaps out of misunderstanding. Administrators are only allowed to make discretionary sanctions in arbitration cases where they are explicitly allowed to - Kirill's comment was in relation to discretionary sanctions only (check the context of his comment; the heading under which he made it). FloNight's comment is in relation to administrator enforcement in general, which is why the SAB remedy has been proposed in the homeopathy case.   

It is only disruptive where there is edit-warring - that is, edit-warring against consensus (separate policy on conduct). NO administrator has made blocks for violations of WP:NPOV, WP:V, and WP:NOR because they can be desysopped for making a rulings on content - for which they do not have the authority. Would you like arbitrator clarification?   

Did you read what I said above? NO administrator has made blocks for violations of WP:NPOV, WP:V, and WP:NOR because they can be desysopped for making a rulings on content - for which they do not have the authority. See also: . 
Discussing content issues at a conduct Rfc is inappropriate - we have a clear distinction between Article Rfc and Rfc on user conduct for that reason. What is acceptable is pointing editors to an Article RFC so editors can comment on content (and hence address content issues), and that is where discussion of those issues belong in the dispute resolution process.   

So please modify your view so that there is no misrepresentation of policy/norms as it has been sanctioned by the Committee in the past (and admins have been sanctioned when using their position to make a ruling on content). Article RFC is where comment is made on the content policies you have quoted - you are welcome to direct a link to the discussion there in your view so that it is dealt with.   

It seems you don't get the point - it's ok if you think it should be enforceable, but it is completely irresponsible to misrepresent policy by saying that it must be enforcible when it is forbidden, and engaging in misrepresentation in using an arbitrator's view on a separate matter to be absolute on all matters. It contributes to the confusion editors have about Wikipedia norms and policies, and it is unacceptable. Therefore, I am referring it directly to the Committee.   

The assumption of bad faith is on your part, for you clearly have not read - NO administrator has made blocks for violations of WP:NPOV, WP:V, and WP:NOR because they can be desysopped for making a rulings on content - for which they do not have the authority.

 """"The Man of a Thousand Voices"""" 

I took the liberty of editing the following statement:

""""Little has long been known as a top impersonator of famous people throughout the world, which has earned him the nickname """"The Man of a Thousand Voices,"""" a name which notable voice actor Mel Blanc once held.""""

Besides the grammar errors (a title is not a """"name"""" or a """"nickname""""), the latter half of the sentence is not an objective statement  it makes it sound like Little and Blanc faced off in a bid for the title and Blanc lost. That's simply foolish and inaccurate.

Blanc was the first to be given this title and he will forever be """"The Man of a Thousand Voices"""". Little would more accurately be """"The Man of a Thousand Impressions"""", but Blanc's title has been used to refer to Little also by less-informed individuals (primarily media reporters unfamiliar with Blanc or his huge volume of work and repertoire that frankly make Little's look like a dwarf by comparison).

I changed the statement so it reads more objectively:

""""Little has long been known as a top impersonator of famous people throughout the world, which has resulted in him being refered to as """"The Man of a Thousand Voices"""" (a title also associated with voice actor Mel Blanc).

"""
BTW, /where/ a particular critic is published or quoted is 'technically' only relevant (for verifiability) as far as the 'reputation' of the publication. Time and Womens Wear Daily are equally 'reputable sources', in the very sense I mean, as in that if either one publishes an interview with a major personality you can be pretty damn sure the person actually said the quotes. Writing """"Bob said 'I love it!'"""" is a 'statement of a fact directly known to the author'. The interviewer saw and heard the interviewee say it, unless they are lying, the publisher let them get away with it, and the interviewee didn't scream bloody murder. Doubtful for either of those magazines.
The same critic's interview published on the fansite 'www.ilovebooks.com' fails that test (His published quotes are 'notable', but not 'verifiable'). In the little known 'Collection of My Interviews of Book Critics', written by 'Joe English Professor, Ph.D.' and published by Oxford University Press it definitely passes due to scholarly review.
OTOH, the interview quotes of an 'unnamed Palestinean' as part of an article in Time about the West Bank pass the verifiability test, though 'notability' of the quotes would depend on context. The same article in Womens Wear Daily does not, as they are much less likely to have fact checked it as thoroughly, which is needed for something such as that. It's much more plausible that the WWD author spent his entire 'in country' time sitting in the hotel bar writing a fake article and got away with it. Get it?
It's also unlikely, TBH, that Bloom would have said anything different if he was asked the exact same questions, in the same order, by the same person, in the exact same context except that the interview was for Time. Also, a formal 'review' by him would have said the same thing....just in better language.
As far as a book review by a professional, which is a 'direct statement of opinion by an expert', where the critic is published is a function of his 'reputation', not vice versa. Peeps write reviews for Time instead of The Podunk Daily because of their reputation, and the fact they are published in Time is just an indication of that.
Say that famous reviewer retires, and only writes occasional reviews for his hometown paper, The Podunk Daily, to 'keep his hand in'. They are just as usable, though it might be harder to verify that (you can assume a reviewer published in Time is a 'good' one, you have to check the other one out).

There is a problem here, is that some editors claim Detroit is not the birthplace of Techno, but do not provide citations to back up their position. At the same time, the internet is bulging at the seams with information showing that Detroit is where Techno was birthed. Certainly, Europe has adopted Techno as it's own, more than America or even Detroit ever has or did, but unless we can get some REAL citations going we need to remove, what I see as, the wishful editing claims that Techno began in Western Europe. We REQUIRE citations. I'm honestly pretty neutral in this, I enjoy techno, but I prefer other genres.

I support the idea of wikicode. Basically I think we should present code in a Python-like language that doesn't carry so much baggage. For example, we can use English sentences (or sentence fragments) instead of requiring the reader to understand some obscure Python library. (Further, Python has the baggage that there are no block-terminators: i.e., no """"}"""" or """"end""""s or """"fi""""s or """"repeat""""s. By adding such terminators, we can make it a lot less ambiguous to all readers.) In otherwords, we're basically right on track: removing the quirks of Python, and making it higher-level. So, I support the idea myself.  20:55, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)""",0.0

This has been done because the article appears to be about a real person, organization (band, club, company, etc.), or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

Answer to Mütze
Well, I am surprised to see that I am unblocked! At least, you still have seen that you targeted the wrong person for the wrong reasons!!

Mütze, I have used this Wikipedia for only a few days but I am still not an idiot. Of course, what I say further below on what I think you did is an assumption but I believe a very good one! Here is what you did. You saw the following I posted on the Bosendorfer discussion page:
""""Very soon, this article will be published and you will have to leave it this way; otherwise, the censors at Wikipedia will be forced to side with me (!!) considering the fact that I gave you the opportunity to challenge what I wrote in my article."""".

As you clearly told me yourself, you did not want my article to be published. This quote clearly threatened you because I told taht I will soon publish my article and it will be with the full support of everybody because I used the discussion page of Bosendorfer. You then contacted Andrew Norman to block me to prevent me from editing the Bosendorfer discussion page and then you thought you could keep me away on my own user page with the intention of blocking me indefinitively. When you blocked me indefinitively through RobertG, you knew too well that no one could read my user page afterward! That is what I believe you did! And it is probably easily verifiable by people at Wikipedia.

Now, what is your role at Wikipedia? You are not an administrator; otherwise you would have blocked me yourself directly!

Anyway, I propose to carry on the discussion on the Bosendorfer discussion page concerning my article. I am ready to change sentences that cause problems. It is just up to you to mention these problematic sentences on this Bosendorfer discussion page and if you have a valid reason to have this sentence changed, it will be changed. I am not a fanatic and I am ready to please people. I will use logic and reason to assess a request to change sentences, not emotions. If I do not want to change a sentence, I will say clearly why and we could discuss further on this refusal to accept a change if it happens.

And I will answer the points you raised in your previous postings, Mütze.

So, I hope you will behave a little bit more relaxed about what I intend to do. The goal: publish a good article on a good product that inform people who read it. Apparently, for the time being, mostly the group of administrators and their friends (!!) who are the only ones who complained about my article so far.

But to have had to go through such a nightmare just to want to publish a good article on Wikipedia is surely not the right way to do at Wikipedia with people who are ready to contribute positively!! You are really going to put people off wanting to write on Wikipedia! And I especially target the administrators who have been in contact with me in a very aggressive way. Just a few days ago, I did not even know that what an administrator was at Wikipedia!

Here is what Jimbo Wales says on his user page:
""""Newcomers are always to be welcomed. There must be no cabal, there must be no elites, there must be no hierarchy or structure which gets in the way of this openness to newcomers."""".
If he knews what I had to go through and the very aggressive behaviour I experienced from administrators at Wikipedia, he would not be very pleased. What I say above, he call it one of his main principles!

So, administrators, when you contact people, make sure you remember this very core principle of one of the founders of Wikipedia and target the true vandals instead of people like me who are willing to add a good article to Wikipedia!

Jimbo Wales wants people to write as many articles as possible on Wikipedia. Your role as administrators is to help and encourage them to do so instead of trying to block them indefinitively!

So, I hope you can now all relax and not get emotional or upset on this coming article. I follow the process used by Wikipedia to deal with an article that causes opposition. See the new comments now on the Bosendorfer discussion page and state the sentences that cause you problems and especially why these sentences are problematic. Then, I will do my best to change them to please everybody.

 On recent edits regarding English section 

I have reverted some edits by Capnprep.  I'll address a few of his concerns:

1.  Do as aspectual auxiliary.  This is the only function of DO as an auxiliary verb and is its primary function within the language.  The non-durational aspects in English (everything not progressive/continuous aspects) are marked by the aspectual auxiliary DO followed by its subordinate in bare form.  English has two aspectual auxiliaries, DO & BE.

2.  Do is not a modal auxiliary.  It does not express emphasis / emphatic mood.  Rather, DO when used as an aspectual auxiliary may be emphasized just like any other word in a sentence.  There is no emphatic modal auxiliary in English.  English simply uses vocal stress (or in type, boldface or ALL CAPS) to emphasize the desired element.

3.  Perfection / perfecting auxiliary is valid.  Perfect is not an aspect but rather a verb in any aspect may be perfected.  Perfection is a grammatical category used to express completeness of a verb.

4. I have changed the repeated phrasing """"Most auxiliaries"""" / """"Most modals"""" to ...some... because this sort of generalisation is simply untrue and unfounded.  If anything, of the modal auxiliaries, those that subordinate to infinitive form are at best in approximately 50% distribution to those that do not.

5.  In the discussion of the various forms following make, I have once again removed the claim for passive voice.  That usage is not in passive voice at all as BE is not acting as a vocal auxiliary but rather BE+MADE is acting as a single unit forming a modal auxiliary.  Whereas MAKE as a modal auxiliary conveys internal force and subordinates to bare form, BE+MADE expresses external force and subordinates to infinitive form.

6.  Within the section on defective verbs I have eliminated some poor and misleading examples while rewording others.  That section comes close to conflating infintives with infinitive form and as worded was misleading.

Please do not revert any of these changes without first addressing and resolving these points here on the talk page.  """,0.0

A Nursing Model – Hildegard E. Peplau from Townsend, M. Essentials of Psychiatric Mental Health Nursing: Concepts of Care in Evidence-Based Practice. Chapter 1, 25-28. 6 ed. F.A. Davis Company. Philadelphia. 2014.

The referenced literature presents the Nursing Model of Peplau is based on an interpersonal theory structured on the nurse-client relationship development. Peplau created the Psychological tasks as a learning process which nurses could help their patients achieve personal maturity, since their illnesses have been caused by breaks or failed development during this process. The four Psychological tasks are learning to control others, learning to delay satisfaction, identifying oneself, and developing skills in participation. These stages are classified by age, childhood, following concepts developed by Freud and Sullivan. There are some important understandings about Peplau’s nursing model: Nursing is a human relationship, Psychodynamic nursing is a tool to oneself and other-selves development, and Rules are social establishments important to keep functional the social structure. As an example of nursing rules Peplau define social actors as a stranger, resource person, counselor, teacher, leader, technical expert and surrogate. These actors have an important function to improve the relationship between nurse and patient. The nursing-client relationship is oriented by four phases, Orientation, Identification, Exploitation and Resolution. The Peplau’s model provides the nurse as a facilitator of the process of the client development, where the professional - armed with the rules and techniques – interacts through relationship with the client to achieve a missed learning and maturing process.

Hi, I have started a discussion on the talk page of Desinicization to end this pointless revert war. Perhaps you would like to contribute your point of view.",0.0
"""power versus energy
Good article, very well cited.  [User:Dick Mills]

While very many people confuse the terminology for power and energy, it is particularly embarrassing to do it in an article with such a title.   The Watt is a unit of power, the rate of consumption. Power can not be consumed.  Energy, which can be consumed, is measured in watt-hours or joules. 

The openening sentences which say, """"In 2004, the worldwide energy consumption of the human race was estimated at 15 TW with 86.3% from burning fossil fuels.[1] This is equivalent to 0.5 ZJ (= 1021 J) per year."""" should be changed to """"In 2004, the worldwide energy consumption of the human race was estimated at 0.5 ZJ (=1021 J) with 86.3% from burning fossil fuels.[1]  The average rate of consumption is thus 15 TW.""""   

Similarly, the labels on the the graphs should be changed. 

Unfortunately, the association of consumption with power (watts) continues throughout the article.  Again, """"The energy used to generate 2 TW of electricity is approximately 5 TW, as the efficiency of a typical existing power plant is around 38%."""" is incorrect.  One needs 5 TW of power (not energy) to create 2 TW of power at 38% efficiency. 

Even more unfortunate, I worry that some of the numbers are wrong because of the confusion between power and energy.  For things like wind, where a 100 MW generator operates at only 11% capacity factor, the difference between installed capacity and average production over a long period of time is 9:1.  A dominating factor.  I checked a couple of the references cited, and they too use power and energy inconsistently.  

It will take a major rewrite to correct this article.  Both the nomenclature and the numbers need to be checked.

If, after reading WP:ROLLBACK, you promise to follow the rollback rules to the best of your ability, just drop a quick message on my talk page saying as much and I will update your rights.  —",0.0

 Article Licensing 

Hi, I've  to get users to multi-license all of their contributions that they've made to either (1) all U.S. state, county, and city articles or (2) all articles, using the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike  (CC-by-sa) v1.0 and v2.0 Licenses or into the public domain if they prefer.  The CC-by-sa license is a true free documentation license that is similar to Wikipedia's license, the GFDL, but it allows other projects, such as WikiTravel, to use our articles.  Since you are among the top 1000 Wikipedians by edits, I was wondering if you would be willing to multi-license all of your contributions or at minimum those on the geographic articles.  Over 90% of people asked have agreed.  For More Information:
Multi-Licensing FAQ - Lots of questions answered
Multi-Licensing Guide

To allow us to track those users who muli-license their contributions, many users copy and paste the """"{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}"""" template into their user page, but there are other options at Template messages/User namespace.  The following examples could also copied and pasted into your user page:

Option 1
I agree to [[Wikipedia:Multi-licensing|multi-license]] all my contributions, with the exception of my user pages, as described below:
{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}
OR
Option 2
I agree to [[Wikipedia:Multi-licensing|multi-license]] all my contributions to any [[U.S. state]], county, or city article as described below:
{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}

Or if you wanted to place your work into the public domain, you could replace """"{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}"""" with """"{{MultiLicensePD}}"""".  If you only prefer using the GFDL, I would like to know that too.  Please let me know what you think at my talk page.  It's important to know either way so no one keeps asking.    (comment| talk)

Please note that I never called him or any other editor a """"liar"""" ever. Before the last ANI I had commented about Wee's clear misrepresentation of facts as """"lies"""" about 4 times, these are all presented at that ANI. After that I toned it down to """"misrepresent of facts/comments"""" or """"untrue statements"""" simply because there is no other way of calling it. Have you looked at the diffs presented in that ANI by Wee and me? Can you point to any specific one where I have failed to present evidence (or the evidence presented was insufficient) as to back my claims of him misrepresenting my comments? As I've said, other editors agreed that if an editor makes it a habit to engage in such disruptive behaviour it is not a personal attack to mention it. How would you react to an editor purposely and repeatedly misrepresenting your comments in a discussion? Do you not agree that such behaviour should be brought to the attention of that editor?
It would appear as if you looked at the former ANI and took Wee's word for granted about me """"casually calling him a liar"""". Let me repeat myself: I have not, there's a big difference between calling an editor a """"liar"""" and pointing out that he is simply """"lying"""" (for which I have provided evidence absolutely every time).
You say I'm in the wrong for stating that Wee """"made untrue statements"""" and apparently believe I've not presented evidence for such.

 Full listing of pages deleted in umbrella nominations 

Hi there. Would it be possible to have a full list of all the pages deleted as a result of the Esperanza MfD? Normally with umbrella nominations there is a record of all the pages deleted at the XfD page itself, but I don't think there was in this case. This case is complicated by the fact that several admins did the deletions. Trawling through the deletion log can also be a pain, unless you know of an easier way to do this.

Hey, thanks for participating in my recent RFA.  You were amongst a number of editors who remained neutral on the topic.  The RFA did not succeed (69/26/11).  I am extremely grateful that you took the time to advise me on to improve as a Wikipedian and I'd like to assure you that I'll do my level best to develop my skills here to a point where you may feel you could trust me with the mop.

I've been blown away by the level of interest taken in my RFA and appreciate the time and energy dedicated by all the editors who have contributed to it, support, oppose and neutral alike.  I hope to bump into you again soon and look forward to serving you and Wikipedia in any way I can.  Cheers!    (the non-admin, formerly known as Budgiekiller)

 A very Californian RfA thanks from  

  
 Thanks for your support in my not-so-recent RfA, which succeeded with a final tally of (97/4/4)! I've never been able to accept compliments gracefully, and the heavy support from this outstanding community left me at a complete loss for words  so, a very belated thank you for all of your kind words.

I have done and will continue to do the utmost to serve the community in this new capacity, wherever it may take me, and to set an example others might wish to follow in. With a little luck and a lot of advice, this may be enough. Maybe someday the enwiki admins of the future will look back and say, """"Yeah,  was an admin."""" Hopefully then they don't start talking about the explosive ArbComm case I got tied into and oh what a drama that was, but we'll see, won't we?

Surely some of you have seen me in action by now; with that in mind, I openly invite and welcome any feedback here or   help me become the best editor and sysop I can be.

 Phases of migraine terminology 

Migraine (history page) 
2006-10-08T13:23:04 Msteri (Talk | contribs) m (?Aura phase - This was NOT a typo. """"Headache phase"""" is appropriate AND from the source cited. Please do not change this again.) 

From User talk:Milomedes 
When I typed """"headache phase,"""" that's exactly what I meant. It was not a typo. Headache phase is as correct as pain phase, and headache phase is the terminology used in the source that I very carefully cited. Why did you feel it necessary to make this change? It makes no sense to me to take up people's time in this fashion. 
Thank you, 
 

This is a community issue so I'm moving it to the talk page. Milo  

First, I didn't think it was a typo. Both """"headache phase"""" and """"pain phase"""" terms are (or were) in use, though I don't know which is used more commonly. I do know that """"pain phase"""" is a better term for three reasons: 1) abdominal migraine isn't in the head, 2) the """"headache"""" word is recursively overused, 3) """"-ache"""" underdescribes the sensation, and, 4) """"pain"""" is shorter. You can argue with 2), 3),4), but 1) is technically a debate stopper.
Second, with all due respect to your professional writing expertise, just because you carefully copied the words that were used in your source, doesn't mean that I can't substitute different words that I have reason to think are better. I quote from concluding text at the bottom of every edit page: 
""""Please note: If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed by others, do not submit it. """"
Third, Wikipedia isn't about you or me. I didn't know you wrote it, and it shouldn't matter that you did. This is an interactive community process. If you think I'm taking up your time, then you probably don't have enough time to write here. Furthermore, if you assume that anything you write here is still going to be here, say, 10 years from now, then you probably don't understand the nature of Wikipedia. 
As to disagreements about which terminology to use in the article, that is usually handled with a talk page poll. I respectfully suggest that we use that tool as needed.  """,0.0

I moved the 69-72 Markham and Dixie championships from the Central B/Mid-Ontario to the Metro League, where they played.

DIXIE BEEHIVES 

(1957 - 1986)

Perhaps the first team to operate in the OHA under the Dixie name was the Dixie Staffords of the pre-Metro Junior 'B' Grouping that operated during the 1949-50 season. In 1952, the East York Rockets of the Metro grouping moved to become the Dixie Rockets. A few years later, the team changed its name to the Dixie Beehives. The Metro Junior 'B' Hockey League was a strong league and the Beehives were the league's most stable team. In 1972, a new Tier II Junior 'A' Provincial League was formed and the Dixie Beehives were one of six Metro teams to move up to the new league. The Beehives played in the league until 1986 when they ceased operations. The league managed to last only one additional season.

PATEY, Larry
Hockey
Born: March 19, 1953
Toronto, Ontario
Lary Patey played most of his young career in Mississauga, first in the Port Credit Hockey Association and later with the Metro Junior B Dixie Beehives. It was with the Beehives in March of 1971 that Patey suffered a near fatal accident during the Metro Junior B final against the Markham Waxers that Dixie would eventually go on to win in five games.

Hammered into the boards by 6- foot-6 defenceman Bob Dailey, Patsey slumped to the ice. While trying to get up, Patsey's teammate Rick Cornacchia took on Dailey in a tussle and the ensuing melee, Patey was caught in the face by a skate blade. 

From that horrific evening, Patey went on to a long and successful 12-year National Hockey League career as a centreman. After leading the Western League in scoring while with Sault Lake City Golden Eagles where captured rookie of the year honors, Patey was soon called up to the now defunct California Golden Seals. Later, Patey was traded to the St. Louis Blues in 1975-76 for Wayne Merrick and he concluded his career with New York Rangers before having to retire because of lower back injury.

A workaholic on the ice throughout his career, Patey later applied the same hard work ethic in the world of real estate and earned President's Club Honors as one of the Gundaker Better Homes and Gardens in St. Louis after only being in the business for four years.

While Patey had his most productive season offensively for California in 1974- 75 when he scored 25 goals to go along with 20 assists, it was during his stay with the Blues that the seventh-round draft choice drew the most attention for his strong two-way play.

""""St. Louis didn't care how many goals I scored- they had Red Berenson, Derek Sanderson and Gary Unger up front to do that. They wanted me to play defensively and aggressively."""" Patey combined both skills to set a St. Louis club record for most shorthanded goals in a season and was always called on to line up against the Bryan Trottiers, Bobby Clarkes and Phil Espositos of the NHL.

""""I enjoyed doing it because there was less pressure in having to score goals and I took a lot of pride in my role.""""

Living the life as a shadow, Patey did manage to score 153 goals in his 12 year professional career before retiring after the 1984-85 season.

While the league's fans didn't always notice Patey, or the fine job he did in shutting down opponents, his peers throughout the league certainly did.""",0.0

(Ebyabe made comments which appear to be reasonable at first glance, but are actually unreasonable because one is fraudulent and the other was untrue regarding a place where she could see that it was untrue.)  Well a sort-of reasonable comment anyway because he claims that I am being """"confrontational"""" when it is clearly visible at my talk page that other users are attacking me and not the other way around.  I have not caused any confrontation...   I have replied to other users who are putting a confrontation to me.  (I did ask how to report a user, but I did not actually report him because nobody answered regardless of several posts made, and the user himself did not comment there, so that was not a confrontation like it would have been if I'd been able to make the report.)  I would like to leave a message at this user User:Stwalkerster's talk page but I cannot, because for some reason those are blocked to, so I have to do it this way instead.  Hopefully he has the notifications turned on (tags of username).  I can be calm and work with other people.  This is noted in my first reply, where it gives several examples of how users should have had discussion instead of attacking and reverting me and arguing hostilely on my talk page.  Users who wish to work with me should not make attacks, write words like """"compliance"""", revert edits when they could have further fixed the edit instead (details of referred-to edits in a separate paragraph below, make false claims against me, or delete my replies on discussion pages (not talk pages) and then ARCHIVE it after removing them!!  (Users should not do these kinds of things to anyone.)  What this means is that if users act in a reasonable manner, then a normal discussion can ensue (including from myself).  Merely because someone has used a template, written a shorter reply, or wrote their aggressive, confrontational remarks in a business-style manner, does not mean that they are """"being reasonable"""" or """"writing nicely"""".  When someone makes a falsified report about you or writes a falsified comment, etc., it is not reasonable to expect the victim to reply without mentioning this, or to want to """"be friends"""" with the attacker.  If the other people are being reasonable then of COURSE I am going to reply to them in a different way.  Editing an article by...(below) is not reasonable, nor is """"ganging up"""" (the discussion page), nor is replying in several places at once, etc.  How can replying to other users stating bad and/or false things about you be """"confrontational""""?  I have mentioned several times about having an actual discussion but no one did this and instead just kept replying on my talk pages.  The fact that I mentioned having a discussion indicates that I think reasonable discussion is the right or reasonable way to do it.  Just no one wanted to do anything but attack me so I did not have another way.

The headlines are not """"veiled"""", they are in plain light.  It was not any attempt to be """"hidden"""".  For headline #5, I literally do or did not know of a different way to title this headline which is not an attack on myself.  For headline #8, it is truthful and the falsification was blatant by Ebyabe, and I actually expected her to edit it to something on her next message.  I mean she directly mentions it; edit summary says a reason but her message says differently (directly, not implied).  For this headline, it is not a """"personal attack"""" because it is true and evident: Administrator complains about my signature even though signature has been changed, and messages by me since posted, before the block happened, as well as direct linking to comments which contain no personal attacks as a reason for """"personal attacks"""".  If the titles were UNTRUE they would be attacks, but since they are true unambiguously then they can't be attacks. The last headline yes, somewhat motivated/hostile, because he is the one put an useless headline so that there's TWO AT ONCE, *AFTER* my notice is up, while also writing the things that show the actual tyranny (a word used in this case solely because it is already being talked about, and not meant as any attack/instigation/hostile/etc.). Although the link by Jamie appears to say something about political opinions, if someone is making false claims then it is appropriate for them to be exposed.

So as you can see my intents are to be reasonable and normal (with the 'possible' exception of this particular headline), and repeatedly asking other people to do this, but being annoyed by all their attacks and false remarks as well.

Latest from Sarfatti about the Ira Einhorn case

""""Most of Ira's book is like reading Casanova, about his erotic exploits with women in Ireland. I have no doubt they are true, but the tales, though entertaining at first quickly grow weary if one is not a teenager or an Oprah addict. They are irrelevant, except to prove that Ira did not smell. Women were attracted to him. He did not smell at all when I met him in 1974.  Ira's understanding of """"free energy"""" and his reference to Tom Bearden are not to my liking because the physics is wrong. However, his connections to the Yugoslavs in 1977 when Holly was murdered, the Shah of Iran's family and many of his political activities made him many powerful enemies with the motive and opportunity to frame him and to weaken the movement he was spearheading. Ira's account of a UFO close encounter rings true. Note Ira's mention of Michael Murphy, Kit Green and Jacques Vallee.

For """"free energy"""" read """"zero point vacuum energy"""". Ira is not a physicist and he was fooled by disinformation agent Colonel Tom Bearden whose claims are worthless. At that time I had not yet figured out the physics of what Ira was after. He was my book agent and I was one of his network of """"300"""" that corresponds also to http://stardrive.org/cartoon/spectra.html

THIS IS MY REPLY TO YOU THAT YOU HAVE DELETED ACTING AS A FASCIST FROM THE DISCUSSION ON NICOSIA PAGE:

Nicosia and discrimination against Greek contributors and the Greek character of the cityDear Salvio,

You have accused me of abusive behaviour against other users and consequently blocked me from editing the article on Nicosia for a 24 hour period.

May I draw to your attention that it is fairly obvious that those three users namely Seb az86556 , Seric2 and Chesdovi are clearly constantly creating a picture of Nicosia as a decadent muslim city that serves their religious beliefs and are all clearly hailing form Turkish backgrounds.

There is a constant undermining of the city´s Greek identity i.e. whenever a Greek flag appears in any single picture the aforementioned users delete that picture instantaneously and prefer to throw in pictures of the flag of """"shame"""" and occupation that is equivalent to a legalisation of a human crime of continuous brutal occupation of the island of Cyprus by the Turkish army.

The Greek flag is OMNIPRESENT in the Republic of Cyprus whether some people like it or detest it but this is the reality and an Encyclopedia that wishes to be UNBIASED should depict the REALITY and not the subjective views of a minority of readers that are furthermore based on extremist religious and nationalistic views. On the other hand, such users do find it appropriate to throw in pictures using the Turkish and the ILLEGAL, yes illegal according to United Nation referendums flat of the non-recognised internationally illegal self-proclaimed state of the so-called TRNC.

It is totally UNACCEPTABLE to have extremist nationalistic individuals, that strategically reached the level of administrators, deteriorating all the time the article on the city of Nicosia, promoting an unrealistic Turkish character and undermining the Greek character of the city AND at the same time having an ADDITIONAL article on """"North Nicosia"""" that is depicting a totally FALSE picture w.r.t the city. The TRNC is illegal, not recognised by any state other than Turkey and some terrorist states that are non-democratic and yet Wikipedia has a page on Northern Nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of Cyprus. This is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on Northern Nicosia stressing how Turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for Nicosia and emphasize the Turkish character of the city, talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the Greek character.

This is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable Greek character of the area controlled by the Republic of Cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the Republic of Cyprus the mere fact that Wikipedia has a site that is CONSTANTLY vandalised by several ethnic Turkish extremists and Wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour.

In the light of all of this, I shall stop contributing to Wikipedia as I consider it downgrading for my own self. Furthermore, I do not wish to participate in an """"encyclopedic"""" project that is totally biased and discriminatory.

 Human rights section should be removed 

After reading through this section it should either be removed or renamed """"Why Chinese are dogs and Tibet deserves freedom"""" section. Referenced or not it's a far cry from unbiased. I don't even see why a section like that is needed   

I have added some more references to the ‘human rights’ section. I have also removed a number of the “XYZ claims that…” phrases, because they (a) disrupt the flow/readability (b) are unnecessary; just click on the reference if you want to see who is making the claim.
I am not too surprised that this new section is upsetting some editors. Nevertheless, I absolutely disagree with claims that the information presented is biased, false, or unverified. Regarding neutral POV, what about consensus POV? Information about human rights in Tibet falls into 2 categories; in one the sole source is the Chinese Government, and in the other side is every other source (including UN, HRW, Amnesty, RSF, etc, etc….). 
I would like to see the “neutrality disputed” tag removed from this section, can we please continue the discussion here to resolve specific concerns? Provide additional sources if you disagree with the information from existing sources.   
At best this section is a place for pro-Tibet to post links to anti-China websites and vice-versa. It really doesn't contribute to the article as a whole.   

 I will say it again - if you disagree with the existing sources then add your own, otherwise quit whining. And surely you cannot be serious about removing the section. Human Rights in Tibet is a very serious issue, and this page is the right place to cover it.   
I'd agree entirely. However, some of the wording could probably made more neutral while preserving the facts. For instance: adding """"According to Human Rights Watch, a non-government organization, Tibetans are denied..."""". (Which is done for several other sentences). It might also allay some concerns if sources could be found from a less-biased source. I'm not really disputing the accuracy of HRW or FreeTibet, but it's rather harder to argue that an article from the New York Times suffers from a bias. Just my $0.02.   
It is essential to state where the sources is retreated from in a particular statement.  In a controversial section like this, its important to differentiate the origin of the source, because many links cited in this section came from a particular organization.  
The user who started this section grouped a bunch of statements (with various citings) together.  Some of the statements are not supported by one reference but the other, we have to pick them out and make sure they fit the accurate reference.  
referenced or not its a far cry from unbiased. Please review WP:NPOV. Wikipedia must report viewpoints held by both Chinese and human rights organizations. A statement of fact cannot be biased, and """"X states Y"""" is a statement of fact.   
I should add however, that which facts ought to be included is up for discussion under WP:UNDUE. However, since the vast majority of English press regarding Tibet deals with human rights issues, I don't think it can reasonably contested that a """"Human rights"""" section ought to be part of this article. 
 I am the one who started this section. I did it in good faith, and considered it to be an initial draft for further development. I tried to group the statements together into a logical sequence, and also tried to accurately link the statements to their supporting references. I appreciate the constructive edits done by other editors since then, and before I add any more references I will help to clean up the existing text so that it faithfully ties to the existing references. 

 GimmeDanger is absolutely correct in saying that a statement of fact (ie. has evidence to support it) cannot be biased; it is a fact, end of story. However, what often happens on other Wiki pages is that the argument then moves to which references are considered reliable. This is the reason I have used a variety of different sour",0.0

Okay, I'm going to try and explain this to you again.  There are a few points which you don't seem to be understanding, so I'm going to number them.
Infoboxes contain links to various sites which contain information.  For instance, an actor's infobox will often contain a link to their official web site as well as a link to their IMDb profile.  These are not meant as sources or references.  They are simply links to other reference type sites which are well known for their content as it relates to actors.  The reason that they are included is summed up on WP:EL which states in part """"... information that could not be added to the article for reasons such as copyright or amount of detail, or other meaningful, relevant content...""""  IMDb and IAFD go into a great amount of detail which we don't include.  This is why they are linked in the infobox.
IMDb, much like IAFD, cannot be used as a source for biographical information.  This is because there is little, if any, fact checking done for that information.  For instance, for my IMDb profile (yes, I have one and no, I will not share it with you since it has my real name), I could supply IMDb with a date of birth, ethnicity, and so on and claim to be me but they don't actually know that I am who I say I am.  The filmography on my profile though is supplied by the directors, production companies, etc. which have had me work for them on their films.  Filmographies come to IMDb from official sources.  IAFD works much the same.  Biographical information is not very well fact checked and comes from the average user/reader/whatever you want to call them.  Filmography info comes from the production companies.
You keep asking me for a source.  I don't have any other source than what is already supplied in the article.  If you go to Bitoni's article and look at the ethnicity in the infobox, you'll see a little number """"2"""" next to it.  That number refers to a reference in the references section of the article.  When you look there, you'll see that all the references are numbered.  Click on the second reference and that is the page that is being used as a reference for her ethnicity.  The """"a, b, c"""" that you see there means that the same source is being used for two other facts within the article.
That source is from Bitoni's publicist.  It's as credible as can be and is trusted.
There, now that I've explained all of this, do you have any questions?  If so, please explain which point you don't understand.  |(talk) """,0.0

It may just be the way I am reading your wording, but I figure there is always a chance that someone else will take it the same way and have the same question I do...  In the toxicology studies section, I think your intention is to say that because the mouse study used very high doses of the protein and proteins that will be toxic are usually toxic at very low doses, evidence supports that the Bt toxin is not toxic to mammals.  
what I initially read, however, was just the phrase """"Research on other known toxic proteins suggests that proteins are usually toxic at low doses, further suggesting that Bt toxins are not toxic to mammals"""" which confused me by making it sound like the toxins are almost always toxic at low doses and that the Bt toxin might not be safe.  Perhaps changing this wording would help clarify your meaning for future readers?  Just a thought.  Overall, great job!   """,0.0

 False inormation in the article 
As you would expect, the propagandists would say and do everything to mislead us. They once again proved themselfs to be the proven LIARS we alreayd knew they were since the article wrongly states that the darker picture with the """"fall-off"""" effects is the edited one, which is pure BS.

The original photo is the one with the """"fall-off"""" effect which was printed in The West Australian already back in august 2, 1969 (~6 min in this clip http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMuTiziCszU) while the lighten up picture is the EDITED version who came out much later. So unless the propaganda trolls cant find a version of THEIR claimed original version dated EARLIER than august second 1969, i suggest them to SHUTUP.

 No, that newspaper doesn't show what the original one looks like.  The original is a transparency that is in NASA's vaults.  They made prints that were widely reprinted. See this for more information.  You talkin' to me? 

Bullshit! excuses from NASA wont make it true! you have the history of that picture in the video i linked to and even the NASA site you linked to shows the fact that the darker picture is the first one, the original from 1969, while the more lighten edited version came out 1975. So why you arguing? you dont have a chance here. As i said, BRING UP a picture dated earlier than 2 aug 1969 or SHUTUP - its that simple!

Revert one, and two. It's a bit late to block you though, so just be more careful in the future. east718 // talk // email // 
Yes, those are two reverts; however, the 1RR restriction on myself was only in regards to Canadian monarchy articles, and PoC's edits, not to other pages or other editors. Now, though I was technically within my bounds there, having later read MangoJuice's comments to PoC on reverting and entitlement, I realise that the same applies to myself, and would have applied earlier. That second revert was a kneejerk retaliation to a move that was purposefully irritating, and, though technically allowed, was just a continuation of a dispute, rather than an effort to seek resolution. Anyway, I hope that clears things up.

Lots of contact groups aren't contact organisations for swingers.  This seems obvious in the extreme.

How can you say inviting participants to a Wikipedia-wide issue is disruptive?  How can you say that I should somehow have known that? The real question is, why is this thing not on the main page?

"""In mathematics, an ordinal number, or just ordinal, is a transitive set of ordinals, or hereditarily transitive set.  That is, every element of an ordinal is transitive and its elements in turn are transitive and so on down.  The Axiom of regularity stops this recursion after finitely many steps, namely at the empty set.

The finite ordinals are 0 = {}, 1 = {0}, 2 = {0,1}, 3 = {0,1,2}, ….  This is a consequence of two remarkable facts, that every element of a finite transitive set is itself a finite transitive set (so we can drop """"ordinal"""" as a condition for membership in a finite ordinal), and only one set of each finite cardinality can be transitive, whence the finite ordinals can be identified with their cardinalities as per the foregoing enumeration.

It is evident for the finite ordinals that the successor of an ordinal α is α∪{α}.  In fact this holds for all ordinals.  We write α∪{α} as α+1.

The set of all finite ordinals is transitive and hence itself an ordinal.  It is the least infinite ordinal, and is denoted ω.  It is the canonical example of a countable set, and its cardinality is denoted .

Like the finite ordinals, ω has a successor ω+1, namely {0,1,2,…,ω}.  That in turn has a successor {0,1,2,…,ω,ω+1}, and we can continue in this way until we reach {0,1,2,…,ω,ω+1,ω+2…} = ω+ω, denoted ω·2.  Continuing faster we eventually reach ω·2+ω = ω·3.  We could consider ω·3+1, but moving yet faster we arrive at ω·4, ω·5, and eventually ω·ω, denoted ω2.  Picking up yet more speed, we arrive at ω3, ω4, … and then ωω.  Getting into high gear we speed past ωω, ωωω, ωωωω, …, to arrive at ε0, the least ordinal α satisfying α = ωα.

Throughout this entire sequence, every ordinal has been countable, that is, its cardinality has been .  However one cannot infer from this that every countable ordinal is ω.  To see this, consider listing all infinitely many even numbers first, and then continue by listing the odd numbers.  Then 1 is preceded only by even numbers, but there is no even number immediately before 1 because there is no largest even number.  So unlike the usual enumeration of the natural numbers, in which every number but 0 has a predecessor, this enumeration is structurally different, that is, it is not order isomorphic to ω.  Instead it is order isomorphic to ω+ω = ω·2, because the set of even numbers standardly ordered is order isomorphic to ω, and likewise the odd numbers.

Furthermore we have not come close to exhausting the countable ordinals: ε0+1 is countable, and so on.  To get past the countable ordinals requires a new insight.
  
Every ordinal is linearly ordered by inclusion, for example 2 < 4 because {0,1} is a subset of {0,1,2,3}.  This linear order is in fact a well-order, that is, every nonempty set of ordinals has a least element.  Hence for every predicate that is not false of all ordinals, there exists a least ordinal satisfying that predicate.  Furthermore no two ordinals are order isomorphic, and every well-ordered set is order isomorphic to some ordinal, whence the ordinals can serve to encode the order types of all well-ordered sets however large.

There exist uncountable ordinals, whence by the foregoing there exists a least uncountable ordinal, denoted ω1.  The cardinality of this ordinal is denoted , which is the next cardinal after .  There is a sequence of increasingly large ordinals as measured by their cardinality, denoted ω1, ω2, ω3, …, with corresponding cardinalities , , , ….  The cardinality of an ordinal defines a many to one association from ordinals to cardinals, with all ordinals between ωi inclusive and ωi+1 exclusive having the same cardinality .""",0.0

Essex, Vermont as a City
Hi, thanks for your note. As I understand it its a municiple, political difference. City status doesn't automaticly come with size. This is clearer in the UK where there has to be a cathedral, a university and other factors (such as population size), then the Queen grants """"city"""" status. Here in the US I think its a little less rigorous, but the State grants the city """"status"""" if the town and state desire. I'm not sure what that status brings with it, but its likely to change the way the place is administered / financed and governed. I hope this helps  

According to the Vermont Citizens' Guide, (published by the Vermont League of Women Voters), """"The usual connotation of a city as a densely populated urban area is alien to Vermont.  Of the thirty largest local government units, only eight hold city charters and one must continue down the list to the 72nd largest community before reaching the ninth City of Vergennes with a population of 2,741 ... It is the form of government, not population, which distinguishes Vermont cities from towns.""""  Thus, it seems that something in Vermont is a city if and only if it has a city charter.

 Lets start with the opening three paragraphs 

I think we put this version on the discussion page, FunkyFly had few concerns, we addressed them, and we should start with this version:

Macedonism (Bulgarian: Македонизъм, Macedonian and Serbian: Македонизам) is a term mostly used in Bulgaria, and to some extent Greece (Kofos) to describe the perceived negative aspects of Macedonian Nationalal Movement. In Bulgaria this term is used primarily by the nationalists to describe the Macedonian National Movement as a political ideology, or a regional linguistic separatist movement. In Greece this term is used almost exclusively by Kofos in the context of United Macedonia related subjects. In an extreme context, the word itself means that there is no authentic, but only an artificial Macedonian nationhood, an ideological mindset imposed by Yugoslav socialism (Macedonians = Bulgarian Macedonists) .

The term is chiefly a Balkan regionalism, rarely used in the English historiography. It is not found neither in Enciclopedia Britanica nor in the Oxford English Dictionary.

In the article The Macedonian Question published on 18th January 1871 in the """"Macedonia"""" newspaper in Constaninople by Petko Rachev Slaveikov, Makedonism was defined and critized, his adherants were named Macedonists, and this may be one of the earliest surviving references to it.

First, you are misreading what your first source is. The document you reference is a UN interum report on Resolution 425. 425 dates back to 1978. That document (the report) does not reflect any agreement between the UN and Israel. 425 calls for many things, but there had been no public pledge from Israel on dismantling the SLA. In fact, Israel in public had been saying the opposite. They were not planning to leave until early July. The report being issued on the 22nd isn't very meaningful. Its coincidence. There was a whole series of meetings between the SLA (see later material) and UN/various countries that was a whole lot more damaging than the interium erport on 425.

Second, I think its better to deal with Charbel Barakat's fuller and more accurate version of what happened in May from his congressional testimony in June 2000:

""""During the month of May 2000 our people remitted a memorandum to the office of the United Nations in Nakura in south Lebanon offering suggestions to avoid bloodshed and exodus. During the same month delegations representing our community met with diplomats of the US, UK, and French embassies in Israel and at the United Nations. And on May 18, our representatives met with the office of the Secretary General of the United Nations in New York ... Instead of taking our demands for protection on our land seriously, the United Nations declined to assist us ... The United States, UK and France dismissed our fears and insisted on guarantees which were allegedly granted by the Beirut regime ... The State of Israel only prepared for our potential exodus, ruling out our determination to remain on our land and defend ourselves.""""

""""Despite the abandonment by the international community and against all odds, our people decided to remain and fight for their land and rights while calling endlessly on the UN to deploy its units around our villages. 
On May 22, 2000, and as Israeli units were implementing their own withdrawal and the commander of the SLA was absent in France, the mostly Shiite sector of the security zone collapsed. It appeared that Shiite officers were told by the Israelis that they must leave before the borders closed. Even after the invasion of Hizbollah of this area, the mostly Christian-Druse eastern enclave and the Christian western enclave, decided to defend themselves and protect their citizens after Israel’s withdrawal.
On May 23, 2000, at 8 PM, SLA officers in the western sector received orders from the Israelis to leave their posts as Hizbollah was advancing towards their villages. Thus the SLA was imploded from the inside and was dismantled without any battle. The main reason why the SLA did not remain and fight was the fact that the border was closed behind its back. Without access to medical and logistical supplies, our people was condemned either to surrender to its enemy or flee across the border."""" (from [www.10452lccc.com/special%20studies/barakatjune2000.htm])

The SLA did collapse. What Charbel Barakat is talking about in the MEF comments is that the remainder of the SLA (Christian) in the west did not collapse and was dismanted by Israel. But it was only dismanted after most of the SLA had collapsed. Charbel Barakat and other dead-enders may have wanted (in theory anyway) to fight on in the west, but Israel wasn't going to make any commitment to keep a miniture version of the SLA going in a tiny pocket on the west end of the border. The caution I would give about Barakat and a couple others from the SLA is that sometimes they think of their Christian portion of the SLA as if it were the entire SLA. And from that point of view, the SLA did not collapse and was dismantled by Israel.

The biggest claim made by Barakat is in weasel-words: """"It appeared that Shiite officers were told by the Israelis that they must leave"""". 'It appeared that"""" means he is guessing. Nobody on either side of the border has outright claimed that the Shites were told to leave and that is why they collapsed on the 22nd. Even Barakat is unwilling to make that claim.

Now lots of other things may have happened that the public doesn't know about with regard to the SLA collapse. But the only people who would know the truth are a handful of people at the top of the Israeli government and army. Nobody in the SLA knows much of anything because if Israel was going to collapse them, they would hardly tell them their plan. People (including me) can make lots of hunches and theories about what might have happened, but there are no facts to back any of those theories up.  """,0.0

 First a suggestion for Sarah Welsh, if you are """"struggling"""", and that too with the very first words of the article , just hold off rather than going ahead and still editing the article (and making it, as you did in this case, almost impossible for anyone to comprehend). This is not someone's personal blog, but a page with more than 2000 daily views. So please act with discretion.

 Second, your allegation that my edits """"distorted and misrepresented the sources such as Nesbitt's OUP book"""" is a complete LIE. I did not even bring in the Nesbitt book. So, again, as has been found out on many prior occasions, don't mislead people and please show some civility. Rather, it is you who removed reliably sourced content that did not comply with your own biased views, while you were on your massive blind spree to undo all my edits. For instance, I had quoted directly from Mansukhani, Introduction to Sikhism, that I had referenced when mentioning word of God """"The Granth presides over all congregations and represents the word of God in permanent form"""", which you blindly removed.

 Coming now to the sentence in the first paragraph on the key beliefs, I had made an edit a few days ago. You again made modifications to them. I suggest you actually go and read the sources well. In any case, I have added another source, and all the beliefs I have included are now present in the three cited sources. Now of course, to make complete sentences and for improved readability, I have to add some of my own words. (e.g., key beliefs are """"engaging in"""" selfless service, """"striving for"""" social justice; rather than selfless service, social justice.) I urge you to exercise extreme restraint and caution from here on, rather than engaging in uncivilized behavior and/or edit-warring.   07:22, 10 October""",0.0

 Your claim of possible sockpuppetry in FPC contributions 

I justed wanted to clear something up. Yes, I know that in the Leopard Tortoise candidate voting, I said Oppose with the reasoning """"It looks like an average snapshot to me."""", and that the user Tenio also opposed with pretty much the exact same reason. I want to let you know that Tenio is not a sockpuppet of mine, and here is some information on why I said """"oppose"""". 

User:Muhammad Mahdi Karim sent me a message after seeing my vote, asking me what I meant by """"average shot"""". I wrote back with this:

""""This is what i mean by an 'average shot'. I am a photographer, and I don't really find anything in the photo that would make it anything special from many others. The use of flash rid the turtle of any contrast and washed out the colors while created dark shadows under the shell. The composition is pretty average, all I can say about it is that you centered the turtle. It looks like you just relied on the auto settings on the camera and got lucky. All in all, it's a photo anyone could have taken.""""

It's also on his talk page. I don't have any personal grudge against Muhammed Mahdi Karim and Tenino's vote and reason is only coincidence.

Also on another note, I took bit of offense at your comment in the FPC when you said """"It doesn't mean their votes don't count, just that they need to be treated with caution until they 'prove' themselves. -"""", because you are implying that my vote for some reason should carry less weight than an 'established' user's vote. I'm sorry if I haven't been editing wikipedia for too long, but I have been doing photography much longer than I have been contributing to wikipedia, and I have familiarized myself with the standards of wikipedia's Featured Pictures.

"Avoiding Edit Wars 

Acroterion, I have been trying to avoid edit wars since I was unblocked last October 2008. I try to make articles more accurate, but sometimes it results in stepping on the toes of persons who have a particular point of view. I have learned the lesson from the past, not to push an issue. I have had a few prolonged discussions, but I have avoided edit wars on the main articles.

However, I would like to have your advice on a particular issue. It relates to a comment which I have just left on the talk page of 'Kepler's laws of planetary motion'. I do not intend to press the issue and I do not intend to make any more reverts. But I do feel that there is a matter here which needs to be observed.

I appreciate that phyics is not your topic, although I do know that you are scientific enough to grasp the concepts involved. I'll give you a quick summary. There are two equations involved in the Kepler problem, each with two terms on the active side. A couple of months ago, I was going to try and make major edits to this page, but I got stuck on the issue of agreeing names for the terms in the equations. You can see that discussion further up. There was general agreement about the actual equations, but no agreement on the names of the terms. So I lost interest and went elsewhere.

A few days ago, I returned to add what I considered to be very helpful information on elliptical orbits in relation to Kepler's second law. It was reverted. But it was reverted by a user who has only ever come to physics pages in my time, to revert my edits.

I will now walk away from that page because I don't want a repeat of what happened last July. Interestingly it was during an argument with this same user last July that indirectly led tome getting blocked, albeit that the final straw actually came on the Mozart page.

I intend to tidy up some more of the physics pages over the coming months. I am not asking you to do anything right now. But I would be grateful if you could monitor the situation and provide any advice because I do not believe that this guy is doing these reverts in the genuine spirit of promoting knowledge in physics.

"Blaming infidelity for homosexuality 

She met Jack Dunphy, then a dancer with the Littlefield company, in 1937. They married in 1939 and separated after Dunphy's service during World War II, during which McCracken had an affair with French composer Rudi Revil. Dunphy was devastated by the infidelity and blamed it for his change in sexual orientation. He adopted a gay lifestyle, became romantically involved with Truman Capote, and he and McCracken were divorced in 1951. Dunphy remained Capote's partner until his death in 1984.

I'm skeptical of the statement that Dunphy simply chose to be gay after the affair.  This sounds like sneaky POV pushing.

 Politecnico di studi aziendali legal status 

The Federal Administrative Court (TAF) decided that exist in Switzerland - national - basically two forms of recognition for colleges. This is, on the one hand, the recognition of a university as a person entitled to benefits under the Federal Law of 8 October 1999 on support for universities and cooperation in higher education (Law on Assistance to universities, LAU, RS 414.20), on the other accreditation in accordance with Art. 7 para. 1 of the Convention of 14 December 2000 between the Federal Government and University Cantons on cooperation in the university sector (RS 414 205). Both the recognition according to the LAU is accreditation are awarded solely as a result of an examination of the quality (art. 11 cpv.3 letter. at LAU; Art. 7 para. 1 of the Convention of 14 December 2000 between the Confederation and the University Cantons on support for universities and cooperation in higher education). The recognition according to the LAU is aimed at the provision of federal subsidies and is the responsibility of the Federal Council (Art. 12 para. 1 LAU), accreditation, by contrast, is conferred by the Conference Swiss University (art. 7 para. 1 of the Convention of 14 December 2000 between the federal government and University Cantons on cooperation in the university sector) and is a mark of quality, which does not confer on its holder the right to a federal financial aid (see. FF 1999 243, 355), (judgment of TAF of August 13, 2013 B-5924/2012, consid. 2.1, p. 10 et seq.). Accordingly, the mere exercise of a university is not subject to authorization and is based on the freedom of science and economic freedom, as stated in the preamble of the now decayed authorization of the State Council on 14 February 2006. ISSEA sa is then free to confer titles, without that this requires an estimate accreditation or recognition subsidies and must be considered as recognized by national law (judgment of the TAF of 13 August 2013, B-5924/2012, consid. 2.1, p. 11).

That judgment has therefore 'refuted the thesis of the Education Department of the Canton Ticino, in the person of Mr. Sandro Rusconi who mistakenly consider it a simple authorization to use the name University accreditation The Federal Court judgment with 2P.88 / 2006 of 20 January 2009 stated that the accreditation is not mandatory and that to pursue the occupation university in Switzerland do not need a state authorization, as well as the non-accreditation or fails such a procedure does not affect in any way the freedom to engage in teaching and research university. The Federal Court Ammnistrativo with judgment B-1567/2011 of February 8, 2012 has confirmed that the university accreditation is a simple quality mark Optional without any legal consequences.

As for what you said about """"the way English is spoken,"""" you said that as if saying """"American"""" is the official way English is spoken (even though you did later say it was informalyeah, I know that). Well, it's not """"how English is spoken,"""" as you called it, so don't use that errant terminology.

Mexicans are Americans.

Here is one where he just changes the phrasing, even though the original phrasing was not problematic: . Maybe that is understandable though. He could just fancy that phrasing more. He skipped over an actual error, though. Winger should not be capitalized. Even if these were necessary, they would be extremely minor, contributions, anyway.

"""

My Offer Anent My Unblock
I am back to pursue my case, not in the form of """"trolling and harassment"""", but in a polite, urbane manner. I ask that you bear with me on this.

History
From alpha to omega, here is an aperçu.
My work on Wikipedia commenced rather abruptly when I made my debut using 207.97.213.170. My subsequent edits were along the same line. I was promptly blocked for vandalism. In retrospect, I understand that my edits were definitely not constructive, but I would not construe them as vandalism, as I was just an abecedarian then. 

I returned with Hiineedrequestforcomment to """"pursue defense of my actions on my previous account"""". I was quite hostile to Jpgordon and continued to argue my case quite impolitely, insulting other users. After making my only constructive edit, I was blocked for """"trolling and harassment"""". I continued to argue against my block, and my block settings were changed, disabling me from editing at all.

I returned with The Reformed Editor, truly thinking I was reformed. I created my userpage declaring that I was the alternate account of Hiineedrequestforcomment. I made several improvements to Julia Mancuso, Shaun White, Ted Ligety, Purna, Akola city, and 2010 Winter Olympics, but then I started arguing with users about the ranking of the 2010 Winter Olympics medal table. I do admit that my actions were quite inappropriate. Après reading my userpage promulgation, Andrwsc blocked me. I asked him tersely, """"Does [my block] mean that all indefinitely-blocked users cannot ever return to Wikipedia to make changes, even if they are helpful?"""" This prompted him to change the block settings of Hiineedrequestforcomment to allow me to make my offer. Here I am now.

Declarations
I pledge allegiance to Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit. However, that promise has unfortunately been denied to me.
I promise to let sleeping dogs lie. It was my obsession with pursuing justice of that petty IP that led to my downfall.
I promise to continue making constructive edits. The following are the inexhaustive diffs for all the constructive edits I have made:
Bode Miller
Julia Mancuso
Shaun White
Ted Ligety
Purna
Akola city
2010 Winter Olympics
And many more. . .
I issue an apology to all those editors who have construed me as a detriment to Wikipedia.

Final Thoughts
The year of 2009 was an annus mirabilis, but my only regret was not coming to Wikipedia earlier.
To Andrwsc: you didn't think much of my constructive edits. Yes, they may not have promoted articles to Featured Article of Good Article statuses, but nonetheless, they were improvements to the general quality of Wikipedia.Also, I don't understand why you are giving me this chance when you say at the Administrators' noticeboard that you """"would personally !vote oppose to an unblock"""". Does that mean I have no chance of getting unblocked?
I will assay to refrain from argufying that may launch into a full-scale argumentum.
I hope to participate in the development of an accurate, just, collegial ambiance here on Wikipedia. For me, in the aftertime, I hope to develop mutual understanding with my fellow editors. My amour propre is quite high now, so please don't ruin it.
I hope you will help me help Wikipedia by unblocking me forthwith and allowing me to apply my abracadabra to those articles stark",0.0
"""

First, you added information that was NOT CORRECT, except for the reason you gave for Yepes's death. And it is not constructive to to add biased, unneutral opinions like Yepes was the most """"notorious""""...

Second, it is a well-established fact that RAMIREZ and Yepes invented his ten-string guitar. As I said, Bernabe was an apprentice at the Ramirez shop then, but the first Yepes-type ten-string guitar was a RAMIREZ guitar. Moreover, Ramirez had the idea to construct a guitarra d'amor with multiple string resonators INSIDE the body of the guitar. This was rejected by both Segovia and Yepes as impractical. It was Yepes who solved the theoretical and technical problems by adding only 4 strings tuned a very specific way (C, A#, G#, F#) alongside the normal 6 strings. You want a verifiable source? Here: Ramirez III, Jose. 1994. """"The Ten-String Guitar"""" in Things About the Guitar. Bold Strummer. pp. 137-141. [ISBN-10: 8487969402]

Third, I clearly said Yepes fretted bass notes even when the same bass notes were available as open strings! F# or G# are very often played fretted rather than open! I have this in his own handwriting and own fingering yet you will presume to know better and call this fact """"worthless"""" because it disproves your ignorant (unconstructive) remark about Yepes' """"short hands"""" being a reason for playing a 10-string guitar. Furthermore, Yepes frequently uses the 7th fretted (because it is the lowest string), but not """"frequently"""" the 8th (as you mistakenly claim), which is a minor 7th higher than the 7th string. Moreover, these strings can be used to voice chords as originally written in the urtexts by non-guitarist composers like Ponce or Rodrigo that are impossible on the 6-string (except in the edited versions). Being able to use open strings as """"crutches"""" for a lack of technique was certainly NOT part of Yepes's entirely musical reasons for inventing his guitar - though (I will add) many ten-string guitarists today (who are second-rate guitariats in general) have adopted the instrument to make up for weak techniques. This has NOTHING to do with Yepes's own performance practice on his instrument. As someone who has studied for over a decade with one of Yepes's leading (long-term) students, as someone who has thoroughly researched all aspects of the 10-string guitar, as someone who has access to many many unpublished manuscripts and annotations, I can safely say that I know what I am talking about. Yepes even frets A2 and G2# on the 10th string rather than play them on the open A2 and G2# strings (5 and 9) in an example I have in his own handwriting, and the reasons for doing so are in the context entirely MUSICAL and not about any technical limitations, which exist only in your imagination!

Ignore that, I was looking up something using Twinkle (an automated script) and I didn't intend to tag the article. Anyways, I think I've replied to everything, and I think we're pretty much agreeing on most things. As for any strife between UKRD and SABRE, I'll just state that there's been plenty of ill-will and bad feelings between UKRD and USRD/CRWP, more so with USRD. Several editors, spearheaded by Jeni, have taken any opportunity at international collaboration and problem-solving as an opportunity to claim anti-American sentiments and scream that we're anti-British. (That's why I commented the way I have about SABRE, because I truly want to cover the group in an appropriate manner, but I don't want to be accused of being anti-British.) I'm sure they feel the same about us in reverse.

1. The Forgotten was released as an official single for the Twilight soundtrack. I think most people remove it because they think it was a ¡Tré! single, which it wasnt. Green Day announced a while back, along with Twilight, That it would be the soundtracks lead single.
2. Shoplifter has been here forever with no complaints. The one I saw recently was """"Surely not Shoplifter"""" so they removed it based on opinion. And as for the other we had an agreement a while back to keep this one but people have started removing it again. This was a collaboration from Green Day and Husker Du. It was an """"official released Split single"""". One side was the original version and the other Green Days version from """"Warning"""".

Further discussion
An unregistered editor just edited Oregon State University and asserted that it's a flagship university citing only this reference.  It's a reliable source but it's really, really weak evidence for such an important claim.  The paper was released ten years ago and classifies institutions as """"flagships"""" based on data that were already over ten years old when the paper was released which means the data are now more than twenty years old.  The document was published as an NBER working paper which means that it may have undergone some sort of review process but it was not published in a peer-reviewed journal or other venue where we are assured of editorial oversight and quality control (although I assume that the NBER has those kinds of mechanisms in place; I just don't know for sure).  This single piece of weak evidence is entirely insufficient to justify such a strong claim.    
Here's an article that references OSU as a flagship university that also passes WP:RS and is far more recent: Source.   
That doesn't explicitly call OSU a flagship though, just that according to the author of the article there are two flagships. For all we know the author could think WOU and EOU are the flagships. Personally, I think OSU shouldn't be listed as flagship  if you do a quick search for UO's flagship status, there are comparatively many many more sources backing that up. 65.78.144.35  
Actually, the The Bulletin article implies that the chancellor of the Oregon University System said that the two institutions are flagships.  But it's not a direct quote so it's not entirely clear if that is something the chancellor said or the reporter's opinion or interpretation.  Without knowing which of those two possibilities is correct, this is pretty weak source, too.
There have been several discussions and edit wars about the flagship status (or lack thereof) of several universities lately so I apologize if I'm repeating myself but I urge you to consult the sources in Flagship; they're pretty good sources and include many of the most authoritative on this very subjective, murky, and ill-defined topic.  You'll be on much better ground if you can cite sources written by experts in higher education.    """,0.0

Whatever, no one need take my word for anything. I know the topics fairly thoroughly, through primary and secondary sources in Japanese and Western languages. I try however to avoid the topic area because of the need to WP:AGF, and all I can see is puerile bickering and dumb-ignorant edits based on an inability to see good sources and evaluate reliable evidence. I see only POV passions, googling for evidence to support them, and above, all, the tolerance on the page of sheer bad edits or nonsense that anyone with the slightest BA competence in Japanese studies would find laughable (I'm thinking of CurtisNaito in this regard). There are massive corrections to be made, but, as Ubikwit says, one simply doesn't have the time (at least for now), except to note that the litigants who do edit those pages, can't see the obvious (citing outdated sources like Fenellosa et al. from a century back,etc. I gave details a year ago why none of them are reliable, and suggested how to fix the sourcing: almost nothing done, and my edits are invariably to replace bad edits by giving several good sources, which, however anyone could do, if they had the foggiest idea of what Japanese scholarship knows). If there is competent area specialists available to review these messes, by all means get a third opinion from her, them. Nishidani (talk) 

Well, I also know this topic very thoroughly.' Sigh. I've had to correct virtually every edit I've seen you make, or revert every revert. True, you eventually accept nearly all of these improvements, after persisting on the talk page in justifying the trash you added, but, had you known the material, you wouldn't have dumped in the trash in the first place. I can document this at great length, but suffice it to read the relevant talk pages, and examine each time you've been reverted by a knowledgeable editor.Nishidani (talk)

"Dear Readers, I have been forced to make some editorial changes due to the attack on my reputation. It is my personal opinion that the previous article is a smear job and attempts to slander my good name. A few points. Moving from Toronto to B.C was for one sole reason and that was to find work. There is no record of a criminal charge on my record of the so called soliciting a prostitute charge, thus it is not right to say so. I ask anyone to prove my criminal record includes such a charge. Furtermore while it is wholly true I have emailed the CPC and former YCl members, but not for some time and it is not a regular hobby. As a former communist I am concerned about any attempt to re-build that movement. Furthermore I am not a member of the pro-life board anymore and have not worked for Campaign Life since 2001. I still hold my persoanl views on the matter of abortion, and that is my right.
It has been stated in the press that the homosexual man beaten in that park was in fact participating in questionable behaviour in that park that media admits is frequented by gays. I in no way agree with the assualt what so ever and have never said such! Finally this question about pictures. The Manning picture was taken during a federal election and that is all. I do not force my self on political leaders and the picture was voluntary on Mannings part. Please prove otherwise.
Once last thing re the Mulroney dinner. I was not dressed as chef, that was John Clarke not me. I simply walked into the room and towards the podium. I did not nor was I ever in the kitchen at any time. I suggest you check the archives of the Toronto Star and Toronto SUN.
In addition I am seeking a legal judgement against the pro-choice action network for their slanderous article and I would ask politely that you not link to it.
I am making every effort here to be accomodating and would ask the same please of Wiklepdia.

"""I still cannot believe that there can be a controversy over our national anthem! This is absurd! What the hell happened? Freedom of speech, I am all for it. But this constant BITCHING and whining about political correctness has gone too far. You CANNOT change the Canadian national anthem because it is insulting """"immigrants"""". They're IMMIGRANTS, they CHOSE to come to Canada, and it should be that they should respect OUR traditions -though keeping their customs and traditions, I have nothing against multiculturalism-. We cannot bend over backwards for people who have done nothing for the country! It's like subjecting to bullying, it's not bloody right! And the usage of """"God"""" and """"son"""" means nothing! It's a traditional piece. I am an atheist, and an agnostic, yet I have no objection to prayer in my school's chapel, to singing Christian lyrics, because it pertains no meaning to me. Are not God, Jesus, Allah, Mohammed, Buddha, and ANY other religious deity supposed to all be working for the same cause? Should not they all be """"friends""""??? SO may I ask WHAT is the problem with the Canadian anthem? Allah, Jesus, Mohammed, Buddha and God are all manifestations of the SAME PERSON, THING, CAUSE, REASON! The Canadian anthem is traditional, and it seems to me almost a sacrilege (if you may excuse the poor choice of word, as it seems to contradict my whole speech!) to complain about it being sexist, or bigotry. This ties in with the controversy over the Queen. She is a testament to the tradition of Canada, to remove her would be to follow in the footsteps of the United States. We are not Yanks, we are members of the commonwealth. To get back on track, I state clearly, there is absolutely no logical, moral or respectful way that it can be stated to change the lyrics to a traditional song! A song is a song. You cannot opt to change the lyrics to a controversial popular song, like """"The Beatles""""! You just don't do it! So HOW should it be the same for the anthem? The anthem represents what Canada is. It was established as Christian, and though we gladly accept other cultures, we cannot change every damn thing to be politically correct for all the minorities out there. It's IMPOSSIBLE. Freedom of speech has become the opposite. Comedians can't make jokes about religion, sexuality, gender without being complained at, reprimanded at by minorities. Australia is a perfect example of how a country should be run. They say to immigrants: """"You make the choice to live here. That means you have to live with the way Australians live, Australian code, Australian traditions. Don't come here expecting us to change just for you."""" This is how a country should be. It seems unfair that we should change everything to be politically correct, just so that some bleeding heart out there can go to their bed -Oh, is that politically incorrect to the homeless? I'll change that to """"area of rest""""- and not grumble and whine, prepared to get up the next morning and petition to change all the lyrics of gospel music, or to remove all films that even mention a religious deity in a disrespectful manner. Please, I beg, I PRAY, (God forbid, heheheh) that we all come to our senses and realize """"Don't sweat the small stuff"""". Get on, toughen up, put your helmet on, keep on trucking. It's an imperfect world, you can't have your way all the time. If someone at high school insults you, you ignore it. You stay away from them. SO? Does that not apply to here?

 Note that valid questions I asked in regards to my citations were never answered by the contributor Mihaiam, who is the only person who has repeatedly removed my addition - and yet I am the one accused of having my version enforced - when it is Mihaiam repeatedly removing my contributions.  The first sentence regarding the Copenhagen Interpretation was present before I made redactions to the article - and has also been repeatedly removed by Mihaiam - therefore it is not even my additions Mihaiam is insisting upon, it is his own version.  This is not consensus, it is Mihaiam insisting he be the only contributor.

I find it interesting that this first original sentence was removed by Mihaiam (that was not even my inclusion) along with the additional clause I included with solid citations and references (including links to other Wikipedia Pages with almost exact quotes) regarding the Von Neumann Interpretation - as an adjunct to the Copenhagen Intepretation - both of which are well established in Quantum Physics and is very much related to Quantum Entanglement.  The two Interpretations included are the most prominent Interpretations of the Measurement problem at this time, therefore Mihaiam specious argument that it provides undue weight is also a straw man argument.

Consensus means I also have a right to provide my contributions.  Currently I am blocked out from editing.  So what is next.  How does one enter fair arbitration where someone looks at the references and citation I have made in good faith and an equitable decision is made - not just Mihaiam who has not answered my repeated requests asking why he thought my references were invalid - which is not a free discussion or an attempt at achieving consensus in good faith (and yet I am being blamed here.)

 Removal of beta service pages/notability issues 

Hi Henrik

I have edited the entry on my father, Keith Lawrence who flew in the Battle of Britain in 1940.  He is still alive and I see him every week.  As well as knowing his date of birth and his general life history, I have access to his Pilot's Flying Logbook, giving completely accurate information about his time in RAF - but this is not a published document.   This information and the Logbook are primary sources, which I have used for the Edits I have done.

I have noted several administrative points:

(a)  It says """"This is very much a beta service and may disappear or change at any time"""", presumably because of the low numbers of people viewing the page.
(b) """"The topic of this article may not meet the general notability guideline. Please help to establish notability by adding reliable, secondary sources about the topic. If notability cannot be established, the article is likely to be merged, redirected, or deleted. (August 2011)""""

My questions are: 
1) If I add secondary sources (confirmation of material relating to Keith Lawrence which is in various published books) does that reduce the liklihood of the article being merged, redirected or deleted?  Or might it disappear anyway, because it is a 'beta service'?
2) If I spend time adding references and citations to secondary sources, is there a time limit for doing this, please?  (For example, 6 months from the August 2011 date mentioned above?)

Basically, I would like to know, please, if it is worth me spending time providing secondary sources if the article will be deleted anyway because of the low number of 'hits' the page receives.

Thanks,

Tom Brokaw a rogue on wacky-pedia
Sunday, March 15th 2009, 4:00 AM

Debate moderator Tom Brokaw talks prior to the Town Hall Presidential Debate at Belmont University's Curb Event Center.

ARTICLES
Celebrity side dish: John Malkovich brushes Bernie Madoff off of his shoulders
Tom Hanks' films are helping us 'Buck' up through tough times
He’s one of journalism’s most beloved and respected men, but someone appears to have it in for Tom Brokaw. 
Look up the former NBC News anchor on Wikipedia and you’ll find a review of his Emmy-winning reports, his best-selling books, his 20 honorary degrees. Until recently, you also would have found this sentence: 
“He had been married to Meredith Lynn Auld (a former Miss South Dakota and author) from 1962 until 2007, when an alleged affair between Brokaw and Diane Sawyer ended their marriage.”
The Brokaws’ marriage is very much intact (a Google image search shows them arm in arm at events throughout 2008 and 2009). Likewise, ABC News’ Sawyer remains happily married to director Mike Nichols.
A rep for Brokaw said he “burst out laughing” when he heard about the supposed affair. Contacted in the arctic reaches of Finland, Sawyer sent back word through her rep that, “as cute as Tom is, she laughed so hard she nearly fell off the icebreaker she’s traveling on.”
The purported affair, anonymously added to Brokaw’s bio on Feb. 27, was deleted after five days. Wikipedia Foundation spokesman Jay Walsh tells us the post “would constitute a ‘vandal edit’” but doubted the vandal could be found.
“It’s an open system,” says Walsh. “People may use it to exert their views. But the biographies of living people are most scrutinized by our volunteer editors. It’s incumbent on the Wikipedia Foundation to make sure they’re accurate.”
Walsh surmised that “someone with some agenda” was behind the post. Or maybe there’s more than one person. Clicking on the discussion page of Brokaw’s bio reveals attempts to slip in digs about his accent and personality. Wiki watchdogs rejected the insults, though not the unflattering picture of the newsman, which reminded one reader of “Clint Eastwood saying, ‘Do you feel lucky, punk?’ ”
The effort to smear Brokaw recalls the anonymous Wiki attack in 2005 on former assistant attorney general John Seigenthaler Sr., who, it was falsely claimed, masterminded the assassinations of both John and Bobby Kennedy.
Brokaw isn’t the only newsman targeted by Wiki vandals. “Some of our correspondents have stalkers who constantly post falsehoods,” says a source at another network news department. “We’ve had Wikipedia block posts from repeat offenders.”
But the unflappable Brokaw isn’t calling for any investigations. Through his rep he said, “This is beneath comment.”

"I'm not clear whether a picture of a child's genitalia is legitimate or not - you appear to be more familiar with the way it works than me; perhaps you should ask whether images of children's genitalia are acceptable on Wikipedia.

I object to it for several reasons.  The is first that it is an image of a child's genitalia (albeit deceased), which is not usually accepted online for non-intersex children, and I am not sure why intersex childrens' genitals should be an exception to this.  Second, the example in question is quite an extreme case, where the child had a number of complications which meant it did not survive, and the genital ambiguity was one aspect of those complications.  I would worry that people seeking information and support would find this paper quite shocking, and as you are no doubt aware, it is an extremely rare case which has limited bearing on the experiences of the majority of intersex people.  So, is it a representative image (and link) on intersex?  No, it is not.  So, why is it there?  Finally, I resist the reduction of intersex issues to simply being about genital ambiguity - just as I resist the reduction to XY/XX chromosomes and all that entails.  I am sure that there would be better, fully consensual, images available if required - although I am not sure why they are necessary.  People who are involved with intersex in some way will not find it informative or helpful, so the only purpose appears to be either for 'shock' value or voyeurism, neither of which seem valid reasons for having the picture on Wikipedia.",0.0

"""

I've got to say, I've read you """"pacafistic"""" rules, seen your idea of """"logic"""", and have heard tales of your """"justification"""" and I just have to say:

I have this to say on my behavior:
I'm a perfectly reasonable person when it comes to arguements, even when they are against my favor. I change subjects, help the people with simple little details they might have gotten wrong, ask them for proper information that I might use against them, basically anything a scatter brainer would do.

I let people have their ways for a little while just to experiment with how it turns out, I try to help BOTH OF US come out on top, I treat both equelly, and I don't get angry when someone yells in my face.

Why should I? They are angry first so I know they are suffering enough and would only poke at them some more just to annoy them (sound fimiliar?) I give them their space though I would still do what I did/do to annoy them. Except, I do it without coming into contact with them (as they would do to me) which I know we'd both appreciate.

I keep the sitch isolated someone else doesn'tblow the entire thing out of proportion before me and that person can resolve the matter only with each other which is inevitable. Others can't resolve the problem, only make it bigger and more serious for either 1 or both. see below.

If they ever try to apologize I tell them not to→ because I wouldn't→ because I have no reason to→ because we shouldn't have been in a scrabble no if ands or buts about it. Conflict is stupid. Almost (but not quite) as stupid as the species that create/embrace it. Leave the creatures space to realize this and you will have peace once more until the next pointless bicker and inevitable resolve.

Now, I have this to say about the """"good"""" people of wikipedia:
Wow.
There sure aren't a lot of you. I wonder why... You've seen many cases and classes of human behavior and traits, you (think) you know what to expect. Well you have most of it down. But you went wrong at a few turns:
1. You (blindly) follow invalid rules and principles that completely misinterpret the act and are constantly showing how much shit they're full of.

2. You think you got """"human psychology"""" in the bag and have tried to play from this to class your principles into rules but your system is far outdated and very inhumane.

3. You don't want to and try not to link yourselves and articles with POV(point of views) but little have you realized your entire system thrives apon it. 
You take sides in arguments between users based solely on what YOU think is most right based apon how YOU have been taught what is right. You are NO ONE to interpret what """"mad"""", """"kind"""", """"eccentric"""", ect. is. Just another group of the bunch and they all think seperately on subjects or else we'd look and be exactly the same. And you don't want that. 
And don't you tell me to calm down, I get just the opposite when people try to make me look crazy that way, and it certainly isn't any diffen't with Bots. 

4. Most importantly, you robots are full of shit:
You take leaders/favorites→ who take favorites→ who put up with your shit like its the right thing to do because they don't knowwhat else to do. Sickening.

2a. You abuse your power instead of embracing it's enlightenment.
Don't you get it?! He wasn't going to block me himself because he wanted to toy with me. He knew I knew he was higher than me and could just as easily waved a hand and blocked me himself. But he didn't. He wanted to add insult to injury. 
You think people want to have someone powerful to look up to? NO! They want to be someone powerful so they can feel embraced/in. 
We all want what we shouldn't have. 
Unfortunately, there are some of us who already have what we shouldn't have.

5. How you go about it is the wrong way. 
Some things people must learn for themselves. You have a problem, try relying on yourself and no one else to resolve.  
If some people are fighting with each other over the internet just sit back and let them/butt out and leave them to their bickering. Sooner or later they will stop arguing of their own account/or reasoning. Or they may even just """"stop"""". BUT if someone bigger than both of them butts in and takes a side however they see fit, things will get much worse.

I'll let you know whether you care or not...:

That's pretty telling, espcially since I bolded parts of the quote and I pretty rarely bold things.

From the Place formally known as the Honey Moon capital of the world, comes a strangely melodic sound. It is not one you’ll hear on the speakers on Clifton hill, nor coming from the lone ice cream truck peddling its way around the city as it pleases. No this is an ever changing sound, one that will make you both want to punch a baby in the face, while singing it a sweet sweet lullaby as it drifts off to sleep. This sound can be collectively referred to as I’ve Got Gloria, a band that is set to take charge of the Niagara pop punk scene.
For years, I’ve Got Gloria has been revamping, rearranging; honing its own sound if you will. Making the progression away from its post-core beginnings in favor of a more female friendly, get your panties wet, rush the stage/strip us naked and have your way with us type of sound. Having shared the stage with the likes of From Man In Ghost, Ten Second Epic, The Midway State, Tonight Tonight, & Everlea, has only added to the ever growing list of influences making our sound that much more distinct. The band has quite literally been Rebuilt, as the name as well as the subject matter of their debut EP describes. With new ideas in their arsenal, and guns blaring, I’ve Got Gloria is going to be around for a very long time, get use to it. 

I've Got Gloria is a pop punk band from Niagara Falls, Ontario. The band consists of five guys Josh Dekker, Antonio Cirillo JR, Jeremy Morocco, Nicholas Plati JR, and Jason Golden. 

Their First EP , """"Rebuilt"""" was released in August 2012. The EP was the end product of years of creating music finally recorded! The band plans to tour in MAY 2013, and plans to release a full length album, spring/summer 2013!""",0.0

Later, of course, the Turks conveniently took the role of the great enemies of Iran.  The extent of the influence of the Iranian epic is shown by the Turks who accepted it as their own history as well as that of Iran.  The Turks were so much influenced by this cycle of stories that in the eleventh century AD we find the Qarakhanid dynasty in Central Asia calling itself the 'family of Afrasiyab' and so it is known in the Islamic history”(R.N.

There isn't really an easy way to do this. I generally use a combination of Illustrator CS and a text editor, and any knowledge on basic SVG specifications for basic types (such as default parameter values, so that certain data can be excluded). I used to use Inkscape, but it felt too clunky and produces really bloated SVG code—it is sad to say (since I support free software) that I really appreciate Illustrator, since it is slick and produces very clean SVG code. Certainly, Adobe authored the SVG specifications, so it is not surprising that Illustrator writes the best output (in my opinion). However, when opening SVG files in Illustrator that were originally saved in the Inscape SVG format, Illustrator will usually retain the """"sodipodi"""" metadata, which is specific only to that application (and Inkscape). I try to remove the sodipodi data using a text editor to keep the code to the standard SVG coding, then reopen/save in Illustrator. Another method is to save the figure as an Illustrator AI or PDF file, then reopen/save in Illustrator again to shed the sodipodi metadata. If this fails, and it is a simple circle, I redraw the object. Often I'll name objects, but remove """"Layer 1"""", since multiple layers are not needed for logos. If you can, find original artwork in PDF format, and simply open it up in Illustrator, and edit then save in SVG.

European IQ
The third paragraph of 2.3 refers to a web page (it's also a boo-boo external link and needs to die). The web page itself lists
 Buj, V., 1981, Average IQ values in various European countries, Personality and Individual Differences, 2, 168-169
Alexopoulos, D.S., 1997, Urban vs rural residence and IQ. Psychological Reports, 80, 851-860
Lynn R. and Vanhanen T., 2002, IQ and the Wealth of Nations, Westport, CT: Praeger. [Online Table]
Demetriou, A., 2005, The architecture, dynamics, and development of mental processing: Greek, Chinese, or Universal?, Intelligence, 33, 109-141
I would be happy to link to any of these primary sources instead, and I think Buj is the correct one, right? So I would like the footnote to read: 
Buj (1981), some of the data can be found at Greek IQ

The difference between the neighboring white Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland is as large as the differences between whites and blacks in the U.S.[6]

""""Alternative hip hop, like all genres of art, is a social construction and as such the definition is open to debate.""""     

If with the term """"social construction"""" in this sentance, the statement """"Alternative hip hop, like all genres of art, is a social construction"""" is meant to convey that any musical work one calls """"alternitive hip hop"""" happens to be the product of an agent operating under certain social conditions (as opposed to working in a vacuum), or if it is meant to establish that the term """"alternative hip hop"""" was created by such an agent, then the statement is quite true.  However, a """"social construction"""" typically is opposed to a """"natural kind"""" in that it is only conventional.  In this sense it is not altogether clear if in fact the statement is true:  take the art genres """"Oil Painting"""" and """"Punk Rock"""":  it is not merely as a point of convention that we say these two genres are different, there is a matter of fact about it.  However, in neither of these senses does it straightforwardly follow that """"as such the definition is open to debate.""""  I do not mean to contend that the definition isn't open to debate, but only that its openness to debate isn't tied in any direct way to whether it is a """"social contruction"""".  In the first case, consider the terms """"integer"""" and """"one"""": both terms where surely created by agents in a social setting, yet their definitions are particularly rigorous.  As for the second case, i might say that a man is jewish just in case his mother were jewish.

"Prior to today's fiasco of edit reverts, particularly, above by Binksternet, four editors: Ozhistory, Greengrounds, Sayerselle and myself have been working diligently and in collaboration to address of number of concerns for weeks and making substantial progress while Binksternet made little contribution of substance. Though there was an appeal to do so. 

Today - with little consideration and in a matter of minutes Binksternet discards weeks of good work by sincere well informed editors. My offering today used several RS's  known by all. And, as stated in the edit itself -it was open for editing -clearly not a hatchet job. This is uncalled for, wholly disruptive and without basis in fact. These four editors know I have worked with them in good faith and served as a conduit to agreements. Weeks of diligent hard work by several editors wiped out on a virtual whim. Very, very sad. I strongly urge arbitration on this matter- or a serious discussion.",0.0
First problem ParacusForward like most wiki editors you don't understand the subject but wiki functions like a micropedia if they want more information the real people's encyclopaediais called Google. Either you don't understand the problems of getting past the big brother police state of Manipur where people are terrified to report the truth or you don't care. I thought perhaps this might be a place to release info but I noticed the spike in info came from reports available via google. One national tv company followed by a local newspaper broke the story on the death threats and hate mail. Then the gangsters responded in an Indian national tabloid. Now they are trying to put the djinn back into the bottle. I don't think you are necessarily malicious the police and security forces wouldn't have to pay you to supress the truth. You are clearly racist or if you prefer the more encylopaediac term ethnocentric. One of the sources the only one I saw that was completely incorrect is a Chinese Government Human Rights Agency. They are not so hot on Tibet and can be truthful on non chinese human rights abuses but in Manipur they have close links with the major human rights NGO which has long been run by the local police. I am sure things will happen but since you haven't got any interest in updating it none will report it here. I don't believe it is helpful either. Wiki did not allow the 24 hours grace to support to keep my fiancee alive again not out of malice but because of aspergers syndrome. I am sending her Hard Times if you haven't read it Wiki does a good summary they are also good for things like definition of satyagraha but for up to date info Google is the first port of call or Twitter. So anyway good luck with your project but the manner in which a few ignorant racist wiki editors claim ownership of this venture with nobody else having the courage to challenge them in case they too are red handed by a confederacy of dunces will make it less relevant. It is far from accurate or up to date. Mainly because editors like you do not have sufficient background understanding of hte politics and culture of the articles you edit. Before I began editing wiki hadn't updated info for several years. No doubt now you will accept unchallenged the false government reports which because they carry the weight of Chinese Propaganda agencies and local newspapers wholly intimidated by the Manipur State and corrupt police will now stand unchallenged by the editors who look only at code grammar and syntax and have no understanding of hte problems of truth reporting from within a police state of the third world.

"It is interesting to ponder where this transition occurs between a siphon that relies on cohesion and one that has only repulsion. To a first approximation, ignoring drag effects, if you take a siphon that is operating in vacuum and start lowering it into the atmosphere, the liquid in the tube above the lower reservoir will be in compression and without tension if its height above the surface of its reservoir is less than the barometric height at that ambient pressure. The liquid above the barometric height will be in tension. Thus a siphon at low pressures or an extremely tall siphon, could be operating with BOTH the chain model AND the atmospheric model at the same time! But as the barometric height exceeds the crest of the siphon, as is typical in practical siphons, there would be no more tension, and the chain model would no longer apply.",0.0

Central Nairs are mostly Charna Nairs, who rank lower than Kiryathils of the North and Illath of South. (2) Polyandry was widely practiced in Kerala, and the main practitioners of it were not Nairs, but lower ranking Savarna castes such as Kammalans. (3) Sources about polyandry are written by a few European researchers, who don't have first hand experience about this, and many of them haven't even visited Kerala. The last recorded instance of polyandry among Nairs date back to mid-19th century (Not 1900).

The mere tone of your reply displays that you have a personal problem with me.
Apparently, you think I have some connection to Sante Kimes. I have repeatedly denied this unproved accusation.
I am only a researcher of many well-known court cases and my only concern was the tone and POV displayed on the Sante Kimes article. I haven't even had much of a chance to read over the other articles listed on Wikipedia that I have researched, because of the issues with this Sante Kimes page. The article began going in a neutral point of view, then you began to change the tone of the article. I don't understand it, other than you have a biased opinion. I posted discussions on the discussions page regarding changes that I thought were needed.
You could have simply changed the article to say """"Sante Kimes is a convicted murder"""" if the small change I made was that horrible to you. I think the change to the lead you made is just out of spite because I said """"being a con artist is not a crime"""". I actually meant it in a joking way, not to criticize you, but you apparently took it as an attack because of what you listed in the edit note in your reply and at around the same time you changed the lead info.  
Had you posted on the discussion page about his first, I would have talked with you about it. The change I made to the lead was from a neutral POV. I don't know how it was not.
As for saying """"American woman"""" that is listed for several female criminals in their lead information on Wikipedia.
An example is Susan Smith, one I happened to notice before changing the lead on the Sante Kimes article to """"American woman"""". There you have it - where I got """"American woman"""" from.

Speedy deletion of Lyall Brooks
 A tag has been placed on Lyall Brooks requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

Wow, that was quick.

Thank you for the magnanimity in overlooking my latter comments, AGK, you're too kind.
First of all, though it is true that I learned that NYB is an attorney from Wikipediocracy, there are no entries in relation to you on that website, as a simple search via their search engine would have indicated had you taken the time to check, as a courtesy .
The fact of the matter is, I learned about your status as an undergraduate studying law from your own User page Hi, I'm Anthony, an undergraduate and Wikipedia contributor from Scotland. where you make it a point to make it prominent that you are:
an undergraduate
studying law
from Scotland
Well, good for you. Maybe someday you'll even become an attorney, after you graduate from college, and maybe pass a bar exam, that is. 
Now, the edit summary of that diff of your eliminating that information from your User page is sort of interesting(off-wiki stuff probably isn't interesting to most people)
And what is even more interesting, is that it occurred on August 24, just after you'd posted fallacious FoF about me and voted to indefinitely topic-ban me from the Tea Party movement article. 
Why is it, do you suppose, that I, for one, would not be interested in such information about you?
Clearly there is a question as to your WP:Competence, as far as I'm concerned, but I will defer to Jimbo Wales on that point for our purposes here, as you are undoubtedly aware that there is an appeal of the decision you are heavily implicated in on his Talk page. 
At any rate, I have to get some sleep now, so I will simply ask reviewing admins to visit Jimbo's Talk page and follow the links. I've linked to you Talk page there as well. 
As far as I'm concerned, and I have stated this on the Tea Party movement PD Talk page, WP:SPADE is the operative policy here.
I've merely repeated information you'd posted long ago on your User page and recently deletedfor whatever private reasons.
Clearly I disagree with your FoF and decisions, and question your WP:COMPETENCE to serve on ARBCOM in light of the unjust actions you have take against me.

Did I cite major medical historians stating the Bible was ahead of its time? I did. Now I cannot help people's ignorance regarding some of these matters but I am not going to let it decide for me my position.

Secondly, you keep saying over and over about BSF being the minority view in Christendom.  I say, """"So what?""""    Am I supposed to follow """"the herd"""".  If I were to follow the herd mentality to its logical conclusion I would be headed for hell right now.   Jesus said, """"Many are called but few are chosen.""""  

Is this a minority view article protected under the Wikpedia minority view article rule?  Yes.  

In short, please stop stating its a minority view.  I know this.  I see it as irrelevant as I can cite over and over again where the minority view was right.  I regret having to tell you this but there are a huge amount of majority views were once minority views.  Its irrelevant. BSF is a multidisciplinary issue and it is not surprising to me that it is minority.  I think this should be a evidential issue and not a polling booth.  

So let me make this point clear.  I know its minority. I am not concerned in respects to its legitimacy or illegitimacy.

Since he was reverting like crazy and getting close to uh """"3RR"""".  Of course you didn't, per your bias in favor of him, for some reason (a problem on Wikipedia that happens with Admins and other users...), and sided with his nonsense that somehow """"ICGC"""" was somehow """"not notable"""".  Never mind that they've been all over tv talk shows for years, guests on interviews, and in the radio, and even in the news.  Never mind that they've been around for decades.

And for whatever reason, whatever he does or says, you (admin or not), seem to knee-jerkly side with.  So now that Malik has obvious back-up for his bullying and ownership violations (back-up from an imperfect Admin who is arguably a bully too doesn't bode well for me, does it) it's hard for me to do anything.  Yes, I'm angry.  Your remarks were obtuse and unnecessary.  I violated nothing.  Malik seems to think he owns a bunch of articles, as is seen from his history and pattern.

 The Burke Group

A J.D. is a Doctor of Jurisprudence same as a Ph.D.   Why do you allow personal information that's good for you but not for others who might be interested in knowing more?  He was important enough to post an article so why do you think any reader will be satisfied with a sum total of data saying  he owns a rental property in Agoura Hills with a meaningless political contribution?  The property posted is a rental  where he no longer lives and maybe never did.   How is that useful in an article about organized labour? You said it yourself the article should be about the company.  But in actual fact, he IS the company.    He's a flight instructor whom I know from our FBO (Flight Base Operation).  Lots of people know him.   He hasn't contributed to Republicans for years.  Look at the site you  provided!!  Last one was 2004.  Why continue to keep outdated useless information?  The article cited by Dr. John Logan, a very learned fellow, contains some useful info but also contains factually incorrect information. Even he can make mistakes.   I am a lawyer and Logan is a British economist, and may understand E.U. law but does not understand U.S. labor law.  Just because he writes about it does not mean he understands it.  There is NO newspaper article about CDN that says employees were awarded from the Court of Appeals.  He wrote incorrectly.    The citation provided which corrects his article  is  from the court dockets.  Which is a better citation?    I provided the citation from  the law firm that WON the civil case against CDN!!   I removed nothing  about the case itself.... only corrected the information in such a way that the non legal lay person could understand the fundamental differences between NLRB law and DOL law and civil actions filed with the District Courts.   What John Logan wrote that you cite is liking saying someone was cited by the F.A.A. but tried at the D.M.V.!!!  Are you British?  F.A.A. is Federal Aviation Admin. and D.M.V. is Dept. of Motor Vehicles.  They are not related anymore than NLRB is to District Court or civil cases..   Burke works in NLRB jurisdiction and the case you cite is a Civil Action in District Courts not related.    If you want CDN  discussed,  first part is fine but the civil action is not.  there should be another topic developed in wikipedia for CDN.    Logan's article  used as a citation  lacks any credible legal citation connecting Burke to the civil case.   Only a legal citation should be used.   There are none available.    DJB is a very well known person and lots of lawyers both company and union know him. No matter which side of the aisle...this information is flawed.    If you are going to discuss legal issues then get them right.  Am I being picky?  Yes.  Inside the law you can't just throw something at the ceiling and hope it sticks.   Deleting FACTS for FICTION is beneath the dignity of what Wikipedia has strived to promote.    Why do you say the article contains everything anyone needs to know to justify deleting contributions?   How is that possible when Wikipedia is an opened forum for knowledgeable people to build and add more?  You think the sum total for the reader should be that Burke owns a rental property in Agoura HIlls?  How is that related to THe Burke Group?

On Wikipedia the term is only used to describe distros when the distro itself is called """"GNU/Linux"""" and then only when referring to the distro itself. If you want to change this consensus then the way to go about is not by trying to insert the term GNU/Linux into articles on distributions, such as on Trisquel. You should read Talk:Linux including all the archives of that page, to get the history of the problem as well as Talk:Linux/Name as this is where past consensuses have been formed. You will also want to read GNU/Linux naming controversy and its talk page as background as well. When you have the history of the consensus read then you can present your case at Talk:Linux to try to convince the other editors that all references """"Linux"""" other than to the kernel itself in Wikipedia should be changed to """"GNU/Linux"""". Be advised that this has been brought up dozens of times there, including recently and has always been soundly and conclusively opposed. -   """,0.0

"Personal ad 

I don't want to advocate on behalf of Cao in any way, so on behalf of the article and Wikipedia let me say that I think the personal ad is not encyclopedic material. There is plenty of secondary material available on Cao so that we don't have to resort to original research to fill out the article. Furtherm this is a very poor source. A posting like this personal ad could have been placed by anyone from anywhere. In this article the link is clearly intended as an innuendo of Cao's (supposed) homosexuality. If that's the case then let's either say so in the article based on wikipedia:reliable sources or leave it out. 
As for this article and the KFA, they're not so bad. Perhaps some editors are too close to the topic. Instead of all this edit warring I suggest that we all relax, go edit articles on North Korean cuisine, small towns in Spain, minor fascist movements of Uruguay or other topics that we might be interested in, yet dispassionate about, and let this topic rest a bit. There's plenty of time to get the history right on this subject.  Cheers, -",0.0

I'm just curious as to whether we have any statistics on what people who search the term """"Lowell"""" by itself are actually looking for. My assumption (could well be wrong) is that a majority of those who search """"Lowell"""", just that one word, are looking for Lowell, Massachusetts. It is by far the most populous and best-known """"Lowell"""" in the United States. Aside from several very small towns that share the name, are any of the other people or places on this disambiguation page commonly referred to as just """"Lowell""""? And if so, does their overall notability rival that of the city in Massachusetts?

Arniep: My areas of interest and work are in the fields of Category:Jews and Judaism and Category:Israel and Zionism so I am not getting involved in articles or issues outside of these.

I think it's fine to cite a few examples or to have some VERY restricted lists but things have gotten out of hand and some people are creating the craziest lists and categories for Jews that have absolutely no scholarly, intellectaul, or human value.

"""This is ridiculous. """"It makes Iranians look stupid""""...? Who the fuck are you? A political commentator? An outspoken, self-proclaimed expert on contemporary Iranian politics? Oh right, my pen-name is The Persian Cataphract, so let me try to decipher your next tactical move. The race card? Oh right, your name's not Al Sharpton or Jesse Jackson. Let me guess the next one. Nationalist. That's right, you'll throw each and every syllable of content present in my message, in favour of this preconceived straw-man, fallacy and red herring. You'll probably even point to my liberal use of profanity. I just must be nothing else than this lion-and-sun foam-at-mouth Persian nationalist with an inferiority complex spiced with a pinch of victim mentality. And certainly I must be dumb, as you so eloquently have arbitrated above.

You said it yourself, right here:

...I am used to being attacked by editors whose very account names show they are here for single-topic pov-pushing. Who do you expect to be neutral on topics of Iranian nationalism? A user called """"IranianGuy"""", or a Swiss editor contributing under his real name and no stakes in the matter? Who, for that matter, do you expect to be neutral on topics of Armenian nationalism, an editor called """"AraratArev"""" (vel sim.)...

Is that how you assess content? By making a shallow assumption on pen-names? Expectations? The God-given right to anonymity on the Internet? How fucking petty are you and the idiot who made you an administrator? What next, are you going to ban Iranians from editing or contributing to Iran-related articles? Indeed not just a laughable policy, but indeed a dangerous one as well. Most of the world-class authorities are Iranians. With your fucked up logic, we should dismiss their contributions because irrespective of their content, you'll instead look at their political affiliations and their names and put it into the bin of rejection. Oh right, you're Swiss and because Switzerland is this shining paragon of neutrality hosting thousands of bank accounts of Islamic terror organization, you're obviously this stereotypical neutralist... Good lord, listen to yourself. 

Luckily academia doesn't work like that. Scholarly enterprise and political affiliations remain strictly separated. So it doesn't really matter if Kaveh Farrokh or anyone else is a self-declared outspoken Nazi, Communist, Socialist, Liberal, Conservative or what have you, it has no bearing on content that must be assessed purely by content. That's NPOV. A sober, neutral, objective approach, just bare-bones, bare-knuckles source critique. Source. Critique. Make an assessment on the content, not the person(s). You marginalized IranianGuy. Period. And as conveniently as you shrugged him off because of his pen-name, you shrugged off his fully legitimate criticism of your approach. No matter what country or pen-name or real name you have, it has a universal stamp: Asshole behaviour.

I agree to that. many parts of the article is apparently biased, made-up bs. Examples following

Downfall:

""""It was common knowledge that de Molay planned on corrupting Catherine of Valois' male children by tending to their sorrows, then by engaging in acts of anal rape.""""

""""Philip knew the dangers that de Molay represented; his own sons were nearly sexually molested by de Molay. Upon escaping the vile pervert, they confessed to Philip what de Molay had tried to do.""""

Myths:

""""It is said that Jacques de Molay cursed Philippe le Bel and his descent from his execution pyre, a curse which was responded to by Philip shouting in defiance """"Fuck de Molay!""""""""

""""It has been speculated that several of the boys whom de Molay had corrupted had grown to enjoy the perversions of the homosexual lifestyle introduced to them""""

Legacy: 

""""Members are encouraged to model their conduct after his example of loyalty and fidelity instead of the homosexual perversions that de Molay was guilty of himself.""""

...

""""vile pervert"""", """"homosexual perversions"""", sheesh... Could someone SANE please clean up this article?

"Softvision, the total energy is stated with respect to the center-of-momentum frame, which coincides with the lab frame. You're right that the total energy is much higher in the rest frame of one of the protons, but it's the center-of-momentum energy that matters, because the cheapest way to make new particles is at relative rest. By the way, you can calculate your result much more easily by using the fact that the dot product of four-vectors is frame invariant: (7 TeV, 7 TeV) · (7 TeV, -7 TeV) = (mp, 0) · (E, E), so E = 49 TeV2 / mp ≈ 52,000 TeV.

Thiru Muruga Kirupanandha Variyar, popularly known and reverently called as Variyar Swamigal was born at KangeyaNallur, a small village on the bank of 'Palar' river. This village lies at a distance of 5 km between Vellore and Katpadi in Vellore District. This province is referred to as Thondai Nadu in Sangam literature.

The 25th August 1906 became auspicious day since it has the glory of being the birth date of our Swamigal. (According to Indian Astrology, it was Saturday 4.37 AM, Sukla Patcham, Sasti thithi, Swathi Nakshatram, Subranama Yogam, Gowlawa Karanam, Thula Rasi Kadaga Lagnam)

 
     Swamy's father Siva Thiru Mallaya Dasa Bhagavathar was well known for his discourses on ancient Purana & Ethics. He was a great scholar, his knowledge and wisdom in Purana, Ethics and literature were unlimited. Hence, he was conferred with the title """"Puranethikasa Paarangathar"""". He established 'Thirupugazh Sabhas' in each and every place to propagate """"Thirupugazh"""" , the songs which spell the glory of god Muruga.

  Madhu Shri Kanagavalli Ammaiyar, mother of our Swamigal was a noble, highly discipline calm, affectionate holy woman. She was always align with the thoughts of her husband. Her kindness and helping tendency towards mankind particularly towards poor was endless.     The parents of our Swamigal belongs to Veera Saiva Dynasty (Primarily followers of Lord Siva) got 11 children, the fourth child was our swamigal.

 TAB
     The Almighty now and then exposes his greatness for the well being of mankind makes saints to born in this world. In this chain of saints, our Swamigal known as Deiva Thiru Muruga Kirupanantha Variyar Swamigal came to this world at the beginning of 20th century.Life of Swamigal spread over the devotional activities, Religious rites, particularly Swamigal made Saint Arunagirinathar's 'Thiruppugazh' known to the entire world.

 
'Swamigal established Thiruvarul Dhavaneri Manram' with his own cost and appointed Preachers for propagating the religious and devotional rites and ideals.  Swamigal set himself as a legend for self discipline; above all his life made men to live as men.

Naturally one may not be talented in all subjects One may possess high knowledge in one matter but least about other.

One may be a good orator but not at all a good author.

One may be good writer but not a good orator. Some may possess in depth knowledge in Sangamliterature, but do not possess any knowledge or interest in literature pertaining to religion.  Even people who are well versed in religious literature may not do well in music.But our Swamigal had enormous and deep knowledge and practice of all these arts and literature. In short he conquered, devotion, discipline, extraordinary memory power, kindness and vast knowledge of texts.

 TAB
The grand mother of Swamigal lived in Kurnool. There was a great saint known as 'Gurubalam' who possessed many talents (Ashtama Siddies). Out of his power he could turn camphor cubes into golden cubes.One day that grand mother(mother of Swamigal's mother) took her son-in-law MallayaDasar (Swamigal's father) to the said saint Gurubalam to get a golden cube for the her son in law. Saint Gurubalam knew this matter through his spritual thought.He asked """"whether the golden cube which I give last  forever? """"Further he told """"A child is conceived and being grown in the stomach of your daughter Kanagavalli and by the child your entire home will be spread with golden cubes"""". According  to the saints words so born was our Variyar Swamigal.

 
Our Swamigal never stepped into any school. But his father Mallayadasar taught him education, Literature, grammer, music and instrumental music, particularly Veena, Swamigal started reading and learning texts at Third year of his age.Swamigal was capable of authoring Venbas (a sort of Tamil lyric) at his eighth year of age.  At his 12th year he memorized ten thousand poems and authored texts like 'Ashta Naga Bandham', 'Mayil','Vel', and 'Sivalinga Bandams' which were too hard and a challenge for even highly learned scholars.

According to the Veera Saiva customs Swamigal wore Sivalingam(Sivalinga Tharanam) at his fifth year in Pana Patrar Mutt in Thiruvannamalai. Swamigal received upadesam 'Satakkara Mantram' from his father and received upadesam 'Sutchuma Satakkara Mantram' from Thirupugazh Swamigal.Palani Easana Sivachariya Swamigal graced our Swamigal 'Nirvana Dhiksha' and named him as 'Vama Deva Sivam' (Dhikshanamam). Swamigal learnt 'Veena' from Bhramma Sri Then Madam Varadhachariyar.

 
In his early days Swamigal had Dharshan of 'Srimath Pamban Swamigal' . Later once swamigal received Sadakkara Upadesam from Pamban Swamigal in dream. Bhramma Sri Loganatha Iyyer known as Madurai Thirupugazh Swamigal established Thirupugazh Saba at Adi Street",0.0

"It was not my intent to editorialize the article on Marcel Lefebvre, but I was trying to correct and add some information about him.  I did that because that article seemed to be slanted towards a pro-Lefebvre position as well.  I felt that it did not have enough information to give people the chance to make an accurate assessment about Lefebvre.  The two people who I called arch conservative were exactly that.  Both men tried to derail the Second Vatican Council, and fought both John XXIII and Paul VI and all those who were in favor of reform every step of the way.  I don't know if Thomas Jefferson actually said this or not, it was a quote the Jefferson character made in the movie 1776 that he felt that King George III was a tyrant even if they did not include call him a tyrant in the Declaration of Independance, so he thought they might as well call him a tyrant.  And I have talked to Catholics who were treated rather badly by church officals - especially in the times before the Second Vatican Council.  Why do you think that sexual abuse of children became such a crisis for the church?  It was because of a long standing church policy to protect the clergy at the expense of the laity.  I remember talking to an older gentleman whose grandfather left the church for a while, he didn't exactly what his grandfater's reasons were, but he said it probably wasn't hard to guess why.

Even if people were supressing the faults of the new mass, it appears to me that the pendelum swung the other way, that the article was stuffed full of criticism on the new mass, but anything on the benefits was totally removed from this article.  That's why I added the tag, because what I read gave me cause to believe that this article was slanted in one direction.

"incorrect interpretation! 

The european translator, assumed that since hafez was a follower of sufism and love in sufism had sometimes been pederastic, therefore the beloved should have been a young boy. Well, I am looking at the persian version of the verses translated by  Henry Wilberforce-Clarke, and as person whose mother tongue is persian it seems to me that the beloved was an adult female rather than a young boy. Since hafez is using pronouns to refer to his beloved and the cupbeareand, one could go both ways but in persian we always use the phrase 'lock of hair of the beloved' to refer to females (since they have long hair you know). Besides anyone who is familiar with hafez poetry and have an advance understanding of medieval persian language, would know that Hafez is very unlikely to have pederastic inclinations.
I am well aware of the existance pederasty in many teachings of sufism and I have seen the pederastic sentiments in Jami and Saadi poems but Not all persian poets that follow sufism have pederastic inclinations!!.",0.0

"""Hi. You should be aware of the following official Wikipedia policies - this is an excerpt from WP:EL:

 Links normally to be avoided 
 
Except for a link to a page that is the subject of the article or an official page of the article subject—and not prohibited by restrictions on linking—one should avoid:
 Any site that does not provide a unique resource beyond what the article would contain if it became a Featured article.
 Any site that misleads the reader by use of factually inaccurate material or unverifiable research. See Reliable sources for explanations of the terms """"factually inaccurate material"""" or """"unverifiable research"""".
 Any site that attempts to surreptitiously install malware on a visitor's computer.
 Links mainly intended to promote a website.
 Links to sites that primarily exist to sell products or services. For example, instead of linking to a commercial bookstore site, use the """"ISBN"""" linking format, giving readers an opportunity to search a wide variety of free and non-free book sources.

You recently added a link to Western honey bee that violated the last two of these restrictions; I know the temptation to use WP to promote your site is strong, and you can claim that your site includes useful information, but it STILL self-promotion, and you SELL things on that website. You can't link that on Wikipedia. Note the following additional excerpt from the same policy page:

 Advertising and conflicts of interest 

Due to the rising profile of Wikipedia and the amount of extra traffic it can bring a site, there is a great temptation to use Wikipedia to advertise or promote sites. This includes both commercial and non-commercial sites. You should avoid linking to a website that you own, maintain or represent, even if the guidelines otherwise imply that it should be linked. If the link is to a relevant and informative site that should otherwise be included, please consider mentioning it on the talk page and let neutral and independent Wikipedia editors decide whether to add it. This is in line with the conflict of interest guidelines. Note that since Wikipedia uses nofollow tags, external links may not alter search engine rankings.

This is not personal, it's simply a matter of an official WP policy, and everyone has to play by the same rules.   """,0.0

The tables looks excessively messed up:

The table takes up far too much scrolling space due to the multiple data fields, esp. the Pony Description.
There are far too many colours and some dark colours make text hard to read.
Minor characters are mixed up with the major characters.

In answer to these problems:

I suggest putting long boxes under each row of pony characteristics for the descriptions, sort of like a standard TV Episode list, the description box being the equivalent of a summary box. That way the description boxes don't stretch the cells downward so much.
For consistency sake, the number of colours need to be reduced. I don't see the point of picking that many. If you're intending to make the colours match the body colour of the ponies, it is not going well since half the colours don't match the respective pony. If you insist on darker colours, make the text white, so that is readable.
If Minor characters have to be shown because they had their own toy as well as animated appearance, I suggest marking the Major characters with some sort of Indication like Italics.

I just watched an episode in which he calls himself Ricardo...Ricardo y Acha, which must be correct, because """"Enrique"""" means """"Henry,"""" not """"Ricky"""" (i.e., Rick/Richard, """"Ricardo,"""" in Spanish).  Not sure if there is an episode in which he calls himself Enrique, but although it kind of sounds like Ricky, it's an entirely different name, so I doubt Desi Arnaz would have allowed such an error to be made.

1)This section is passable. However one concern: some sections are way too long and might be uncomfortable for some readers to navigate. I suggest you shorten some sections.

 Spin Triplet/Singlet Redirects. 

Hi. It doesn't make sense to redirect """"singlet state"""" and """"triplet state"""" to an article in chemistry which actually *uses* singlet and triplet states. The chemistry article is an application of singlet and triplet states, and not a proper description of the actual (*quantum-mechanical*) phenomenon.

Please stop with the redirects. There is *NO* justification for them. Spin singlets or triplets are a QM phenomenon, and should thus be discussed in a physics context. If you wish to add a section """"for chemists"""" to the relevant (physics) pages, feel free to do so. 

PS: Pardon the incorrect use of your talk page earlier. My mistake. 
PPS: I assume you and User:The way, the truth, and the light know each other. If so, it would probably be helpful for him to stop, also. As I said: spin is physics and belongs in the category of physics. Simple.

Your Uncivil Friends Refuted

Or were you saying something to the over 300 people who've downloaded this refutation of you're lies?:

http://www.mininova.org/tor/1264745

And so that everyone can see part of it here:

JoshuaZ said:

""""Starfire, as I tried to explain to you Wikipedia cares about reliable sources and verifiability, not truth. Now, if you read that guideline, you may understand why in general AIG and many of the other sources you used are not reliable sources.""""

Hey JoshuaZ the liar, where does Wikipedia's policy say that AnswersInGensis.org is not a reliable source? Where JoshuaZ the vandal and liar? Show us. So you think saying, """"Now"""" is scientific evidence that you are a wise and intelligent teller of the truth or that you know what a reliable and verifiable source is?

JoshuaZ, where does Wikipedia's policy say that the Jacob Sheep Association = a reliable and verifiable source that Jacob Sheep are biologically primitive you hypocrite? Explain that hypocrite who personally attacked Starfire777 using lies.

Show your references JoshuaZ. Saying, """"Now"""" is not a reference that your accusations are true are they? Why can't you make sense Joshua?

Again, where did those verses prophecy anything? Do these look like prophecies JoshuaZ?:

Joshua also said:

""""In this case, they did have sources, so you have even less of an argument.""""

Wrong JoshuaZ. Simply citing sources as you yourself said does not make the source valid. It must be substantiated and verifiable. Why do you conveniently forget that you smug babbling hypocrite?

Your later comments don't merit much of a response, but I wThen he said:

""""ill simply note that accusing people of bigotry, bias, hypocrisy, irrationality and trolling makes my earlier comment about not using """"Darwinist"""" as a slur somewhat irrelevant;""""

Because you said so JoshuaZ, and whatever you said is true is true because you said so. So much for references eh? All you have to do is accuse and it makes you right, right hypocrite? See how you go round and round in circles using circular reasoning?

""""if your earlier comment toed the line, the one above crosses it.""""

Because you said so JoshuaZ, and whatever you say is true because you said so. Science!

""""I suggest you calm down""""

I suggest you not use sarcastic insults like that, ok hypocrite? You're implying that the Starfire777 is ill-tempered merely because he points out that you are hypocrite and uses logic to do so (as well as verifiable references on Answersingenesis.com which you lied about not being reliable and being against Wikipedia's rules to cite), ok liar?

I suggest you also not command a Christian to follow your moral standards over Christ's, over God's. He is a Christian don't ya know? Are you now God to tell him how to feel and think? I suggest you read this verse and take it to heart which millions of Christians know very well so that you learn how not to offend them again:

""""Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger, and give no opportunity to the devil."""" - Ephesians 4:26-27

Last time I checked JoshuaZ, neither your nor Wikipedia's rules superceded God's. 

""""and read the relevant Wikipedia policies and guidelines while you wait for your block to expire.""""

Oh the old """"you need to read it but I don't"""" and """"you sit and think while your grounded young man"""" insults. What an arrogant, childish hypocrite you are.

I suggest that you stop pretending that whatever you say is true merely because you said it, and again, learn what Starfire777 properly told you to learn.

I'll enhance the list for you:

Reference, evidence, truth, reality, lie, bigot, hypocrite, fallacy, circular reasoning, troll, stalking, harassment, insults, hatred, and love.

And Joshua also said:

""""This is in addition to issues of original research in regard to Biblical prophecies and other issues on the Charles Darwin page.""""

Wow you sure like to weasel-word: """"other issues""""? What are you references for this vague """"other issues"""" JoshuaZ the Policy Master of Wikpedia?

And Joshua, who said anything about prophecies? Where did Starfire777 say anothing about prophecies? No JoshuaZ the wannabe scholar, he said """"predicted"""" in the same way that science can be used to predict the outcome of an experiment.

 The various local government areas pages only list them.  I was thinking something like that.  These three paragraphs are from a couple of papers I wrote, they can be incorporated into the article.  

The states (and territories) run the majority of the government in Australia and devolve some of this power down to local government, local councils.  Because this devolution of power happens on a state by state basis, in different states, the local councils have different powers.  Though generally they provide water, sewerage and look after local roads, with the states looking after health, education, police and so on.

Tasmania, like the other states, has a constitution.  Unlike the Australian constitution the Tasmanian one is simply an act of parliament, as such to change it requires no more then a majority in the parliament, not a referendum.  This constitution (among other things) establishes local government in Part """"IVA - Local Government"""" (Tasmanian Constitution).  However, this part while establishing the fact that councils will exist, leaves open how they are operated and what their powers are.  Both the system and power of the councils being provided by the """"Parliament ... from time to time"""" (Tasmanian Constitution).  It is the """"Local Government Act 1993"""" (referred hereafter to as either the 'LGA' or 'the act') that currently provides for the creation of the various councils, the role of the councillors, what power the councils have and so on.  

The act requires that the various councils """"provide for the health, safety and welfare of the community"""", """"represent and promote the interests of the community"""", and """"provide for the peace, order and good government of the municipal area"""".  Generally the act permits councils to """"do anything necessary or convenient to perform its functions either within or outside its municipal area"""".  Specifically, the act provides for the various councils to have the following powers (among others): to charge land rates, """"service rates"""", special rates and to levy fines (in relation to by-laws); and, to make by-laws in respect to anything the council has power to do.
 I'm sure the other states have similar legislation.   (Fuck you!) """,0.14285714285714285

"""

Sorry, your code is even unclearer than that in the article. Where did you pull the 18 from, for example? Non-experts of Python won't know that the return format of bin(a) will have a 0b prefix. Note that Python is used here as pseudocode, so it's better to avoid assuming much knowledge of the Python standard library.   

The Python code in the article suffers from two problems:
1) It's unclear what kind of value each variable holds. The variables should either be renamed to something self-descriptive, or a comment should explain the role of each.
2) The code is slightly obscure because it tries to be smart about not recomputing an index expression. Now to explain the algorithm, we don't need optimized code (and an optimizing compiler, which we'd use if efficiency is of any concern, would spot this anyway, so there isn't any reason to even slightly complicate the code even in production).

The code from the ACM Sian article by Chan is much clearer; here's transcribed and commented pseudocode:

def z_order(p, q, d):
    """"Returns true if p < q according to Z-order in d dimensions.
    p and q are supposed to be arrays of d coordinates.""""
    i = 0 # index of most significant dimension
    for j in range(1, d):
        # Use ^ (exclusive or) to eliminate equal bits.
        # msb_is_less will see ones where the coordinates differ.
        if msb_is_less (p[i]^q[i], p[j]^q[j]):
            i = j
    return p[i] < q[i]

def msb_is_less(l, r):
    """"Returns true if the Most Significant Bit of l is less than that of r.""""
    return l <= r or l < l^r # Described as """"neat trick"""" by Chan

Note that the algorithm in the article has """"l < r"""" instead of """"l <= r""""; this changes the result of msb_is_less but I suspect it does not change the result of z_order.

90% of men are gay 100% of women are gay Rape and incest is an epidemic All races, cultures, nationalities, groups, and religions are secretly racist Most women are secretly sexist Drug and alcohol abuse is abundant Dyslexia affects 90% of the population and is commonly undiagnosed and treatable Mental illness is commonly undiagnosed and incurable Sociopaths need to be separated from normal society
Humans have evolved from primates. There are the alpha males, the regular males and the females. Gay males have female minds. At one point in human embryonic development all people were once female. That is why males have nipples. Females have the ability to achieve a muscular orgasm just like a male, however most women do not know how.
Women can have a muscular orgasm if they repeatedly squeeze the vaginal muscle used to urinate.
Secret racism and secret sexism can be avoided by simply vocalizing the secret.""",0.14285714285714285

Fact: The majority of soldiers serving in the Rhodesian Army at the time of the bush war were black.
Fact: The ZIPRA/ZANLA """"forces"""" never overcame the Rhodesian forces, the majority of internal engagements were short, sharp firefights, the usual result being either the complete annihilation, or dispersal of the terrorist groups involved.

Fact: ZIPRA/ZANLA were both left wing organisations, with full backing from far-left Marxists states. 
Fact: ZIPRA/ZANLA """"forces"""" deployed within Rhodesia preferred to not engage the Rhodesian armed forces, and this was also not their role, as operating in small groups of up to 20 men, without any form of air support, they could not take on the security on anything approaching equal terms.

Fact: Neither ZIPRA or ZANLA overcame (as you put it) the Rhodesian army. Possibly the conventionally trained ZIPRA troops who were held back in Zambia, and never committed to the bush war, could have defeated the Rhodesian forces in open battle, considering that towards the end of the war these conventionally trained troops were far better equipped than the Rhodesian forces, but as Nkomo never gave the go order, we will never know.

 A minor issue with CSDWarnBot 

I received a notification from CSDWarnBot regarding an article I supposedly created which was deleted as a redirect to nowhere. The page was Broadband Learning Inc. Actually, I did create that redirect, but through a page move, and as a matter of fact, I am the one who tagged the original article for speedy (A7-corp) a couple of minutes later, after I had given the author enough time to expand it.

It would be helpful if, in the case of R1 speedies, the bot would look at the edit summary before sending a notification, just to make sure that redirect wasn't the result of a page move.  Blanchardb -•MyEars•MyMouth- timed """,0.0

Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense wants to triple budget, enlarge army
http://euromaidanpress.com/2014/12/13/ukraines-ministry-of-defense-wants-to-triple-budget-enlarge-army/

Ukraine’s Minister of Defense Stepan Poltorak presented the 2015 military budget in the Verkhovna Rada on Friday, December 12, requesting UAH 50 billion — more than three times the current budget, reports BBC Ukraine.

The Ministry of Defense is proposing a budget of UAH 50bn for 2015, Stepan Poltorak said during his appearance at the Verkhovna Rada. He explained that the guaranteed budget for 2014 was UAH 15bn and that 11bn was taken from the reserve fund. Additionally, he said the Ministry of Defense plans to significantly increase the size of the army to 250,000.",0.0

Well I think, there is just plain bullying going on by the pro-infobox crowd. The present unwritten system which leaves info-boxes to the discretion of the principal content editors is best and 99% of the time it works until a bullying pro-boxer arrives off the street and inserts a box and then fights to keep it. I think infoboxes have their uses in scientific and mathematical pages and to a certain extent in political biographies. On pages connected to the arts, their use is limited and on pages concerning ancient buildings they are either over simplified to the point of downright misleading or otherwise are longer than the page.

The person on the page you are citing is giving a fictional review of an album.  Jeff is still David's manager.

 revision to chart 

I know it can be written that he was safe every week but go around to all the AI contenstant charts and you see the result of every week in the chart.   
Yea and they all should be changed. Just as we don't beat the obvious into people we don't need to state ___ has again gone another week. The info of what order they sang is also unhelpful. The lede clearly states he finished as the runner-up and we can give credit to our readers that they will realize that he didn't just sing those songs as a special guest. I'm not going to delete on all those other AI articles but I believe that should happen.   Banjeboi 
 So you think if someone wants to know if a contestant was safe they can go the American Idol season page?   
The chart is a supplement to the text which should be clear. The lede should state as of April 2009 ____ is a contestant. And when eliminated it states that info. Likewise with bottom three info, if it's relevant it will be in a reliable source - and OMG every bit of this stuff is covered - so we then cover it. _____ has never been in the bottom three or ____ has been in the bootom three twice before elimiation, etc. The order they sang? That seems likes it's original research or, sorry to say, fancruft, but not helpful on the biography articles. We have no reliable sourcing that the order impacts anything although it might. It ends up being as trivial as what they wore, their hair, who the friends were in the audience etc. If any of it is covered in reliable sources then maybe. Meanwhile the season article does a fairly good job of organizing the rest. Last year i took this article on and I guarantee it's been a non-stop effort to keep it cleaned up.

Some of these uploads are music, some are comedy, some are anti BNP/EDL. None are espousing a particular movement, political group or ideology. However, due to the fact that I espouse equality and fairness & am opposed to unwarranted victimisation, oppression of minorities, hatred and ignorance it seems that certain users like to think of it as a soapbox to spew their racist, misogynistic, homophobic, xenophobic and hate-filled gibberish....the BNPers, of course, are guilty of all the aforementioned.

Apparently my decision not to allow comments that are basically spam, lazy insults, illiterate ramblings and screeching from morons who don't listen (but just use the channel as their own forum) means I am anti free speech. I don't think our ancestors fought against fascism and for the right for freedom of speech to have hate-filled knuckle draggers abuse that by screeching hate-filled drivel bereft of facts, decency or, indeed, a point.

I do actively encourage freedom of speech for all, quite often letting idiots speak makes them look far more idiotic than I ever could hope. There is a difference between debate and spamming, insulting, not listening and preaching though.

I'm happy to debate, but a debate consists of two sides discussing their views, not one shouting and refusing to listen to anyone else. It is my channel and I have the right not to allow trolls, clones, neo Nazis, racists, haters and all round ne'er do wells the right to puke bile all over it....this is not suppression of freedom of speech and if anyone cares to look back through my channel they will see I actively encourage debate, but also see how so many choose to eschew debate in favour of:
1. Attempting to belittle, hurl abuse and calling me UAF/Marxist/far left/rapist/paedophile with absolutely no basis (libelous in reality).
2. Personal insults, accusing me of being a foreigner, bringing my family into it (they love a """"mum"""" insult) and accusing me of being several users because they can't believe more than one person can disagree.
3. Misquoting, paraphrasing and cherry picking """"research"""" from questionable sources and only ever """"research"""" or accept sources that back up their own beliefs.
4. Lying, accusing me of acts I haven't done and claiming they have """"won"""" the argument when they have ignored the points I raised and just harped on and on.
5. Cloning my account on here and also using my username on far right forums. They have cloned me numerous times.
6. Waffling on about being deprived of freedom of speech (to make insults and allow no right to reply by blocking me from their channels)

Basically, these goons make up a tiny minority of incredibly arrogant, ignorant, spiteful, indecent, amoral, borderline illiterate joy sappers; BNP, EDL, neo Nazis, Islamophobes, extremists, KKK, you name it. THEY are what is wrong with the world and they are what is trying to stop us evolving; their motivation is hatred and ignorance....proven by their labelling of everyone who disagrees with them as communists, UAF, Marxists and Liberals (and more unbelievably fascists?!?) with no basis. Of course, they are just lazy epithets to group the majority into one category when their opposition is made up of a multitude of individuals from left to right, of different coloured skin and beliefs, sexualities, classes, background etc....the majority basically.

Youtube grants these guttersnipes the anonymity to parade their ignorance and disgusting ideals and appear to be a larger group than they are. They are fooling themselves though, they will always be a minority of failures who blame their own failure in life on everyone but themselves. Ironically, our ancestors who fought for every freedom they treasure now are having it spat back in their face with every ill informed, erroneous, indecent and anti educational rant these idiots post.

I encourage debate, NOT bickering, childish playground taunts or interminable clowns on their soapbox refusing to listen to others. It is still possible to get a viewpoint across without resorting to actions a 5 year old would sneer at.

These types are incredibly easy to expose for what they are, they do half the job themselves and not one of them has yet """"defeated"""" me or shut me up.

""""Years after Hanson's death, will her biographer sit down and include this incident and her reaction? I've written articles on Australian historical figures—from the left and the right—and I don't include petty bullshit like this."""" Further point is that it is irrelevant to her entire life and career. So many Wikipedia articles aren't a proper biography, they're """"slap"""" from this media article, and """"slap"""" from that media article; based on the idea that it was said, or done, so it must be there (irrelevant of how petty or non-notable it is). It's why articles on modern-day 'extremists', whatever their creed, are so bad: because they're just conduits for media crap. (i.e. Something negative was said about the person at hand, so it therefore must be slapped in the article; this is done under the guise of it being """"notable"""", but it is, in reality, just an editor taking an oppourtunity to attack the person at hand.)

Do not think I'm blind. I see through the bullshit, whether it comes from you or the media. I haven't moved away from my earlier points because I'm sticking to my guns; I'm merely elaborating on them further in the hope to getting the point across to you and your comrades.

""""National reptile""""
""""National river""""
""""National mountain""""
""""National marine mammal""""
""""Natioinal vegetable""""
""""National document""""
""""National Song (Patriotic)""""

Some of these sound like an obvious hoax, often quite ridiculously so. So, I'd request citations for them. Please. Thanks.  

Certianly some of the entires are hoax.e.g. the entry national fruit states amb(mango). Although mango may rightly be the national fruit, """"amb"""" is not even an Urdu word for mango. The word come from Punjabi and definitely it was never declared by Pakistani government that """"amb"""" is the natioanl fruit. I am removing this entry for the least. 

Similarly """"national reptile"""" is translated as """"Qaumi MagarMach"""", which stands for """"national crocodile"""" in Urdu. Indus is called """"Sindh"""" in Urdu, not """"Sindhu"""" which is much more of a local language name/nickname. National marine mammal is translated as """"Qaumi machlee"""" which infact stands for """"national fish"""". Indeed these are ridiculous.

 a few suggestions on """"Measuring economic worth over time"""" 

I fully realize that this is a work in progress but thought a few suggestions could be useful. I'll post some specific ones on the talk page but more generally:

 Please don't take it the wrong way but I think quite often your writing style reflects academia too much - as if you were writing for an academic journal. However the intended target audience of the Wikipedia is different than that of a bunch of academics so care should be taken to avoid unnecessary nomenclature and jargon, as well as to avoid """"academic phrasing"""" in favor of simple formulations. More importantly I think one should be careful with introducing terms and concepts into the text that have not been defined previously and that a lay reader may be unfamiliar with, for example """"social cost"""" or """"social production"""".
 Speaking of """"social production"""" it'd be useful to standardize the terminology when it is being used. For example it seems like by """"proportions of social production"""" you refer to income shares of various classes (workers, capitalists, landlords etc) - if so, then that should be stated clearly, if not, the difference should be clarified. Likewise comparing the article title and the lead I think you're equivocating between """"economic worth"""" and """"social worth"""" which could be/are distinct concepts. Also because I'm probably coming at this from a different background I'm wondering what exactly is the relationship between """"social product"""" and more standard measures of production like GDP, income, etc.
 """"Both contemporary and historical wage price series are inherently controversial, as they speak to the standard of living of working class people."""" - I'm not sure if contemporary wage and price series are really """"inherently"""" controversial in the sense of being outright rejected by many researchers; at least that doesn't seem like the appropriate word here. Likewise, I don't think the reason why they are controversial/deemed important is because they concern """"working class people"""". They obviously concern all members of society whatever their class status. In a similar way the idea of """"economic worth"""" can refer to entities such as firms, charities, nations or even physical objects such as machinery and equipment.
 Proportion of gdp and the questions given as examples aren't really related. For example the question """"what was the opportunity cost of a £50,000 investment in 1840?"""" is not obviously or directly related to the question """"what was the social power of capital in 1840?"""".
 Some ideas for expansion: """"Theoretical problems"""" sections should link and perhaps briefly mention things like the LTV and marginalism, maybe something like the aggregation problem (though that article needs some serious work). """"Wage price series"""" can be expanded to include discussion of how these kind of data are generally collected (btw, I'm not sure what a """"real price"""" is here. An individual good price divided by a price index?). For historical wage price series there's also a good bit of data available for the Netherlands and to a lesser extent France and Germany. There's also sporadic data for a wide number of different societies which don't really constitute a series but do provide """"snapshot"""" views of the economy/society in time (all the way back to ancient Sumer).

I do not understand why you keep on destroying this article even after it has been sited; I understand you concern about exaggerations and 'puffery' in tarikhs and gazetteers, however if something is true for several gazetteers or tarikhs how can you say it is true for the particular ones which I reference?

So  I'm sure you're a really nice guy, but it looks like you're adding the tags not because of the the article needing a cleanup and reorganizing but just because the color scheme of the column boxes are not the color scheme of original boxes and are matching the Roc Nation colors and of the logo.

That is just plain out bias it not my fault that other people do not do this when creating a record label singles discography, which they can and you have not seen one with a color scheme on them. All I have done is put the 3 basic colors Black, Red and White of Roc Nation on a original Wikipedia column to distinguish it from other record label singles discography and the other names of the artists that are on the article, because the article would grow as those and more artist release more singles and songs, which makes it appropriate and not inappropriate as you have stated for you reason of adding cleanup/reorganize tags. Once again all I did is add 3 basic colors to the original columns Black, Red and White which anybody can do on any other record label discographies on Wikipedia, but I may have been the first to do this new color scheme styling of a record label singles discography that does not mean you just add tags that are not meant to be on a specific article that is formatted, organized and written like any other record label singles discographies on Wikipedia and is fully verified.

"""
That is absolutely false.
You posted a """"civility warning"""" in my talk page.
That was the only time that you posted there, ever, for this issue.
My reaction to that, was to come here to ask what happened.
We discussed it here, and when the discussion ended, without any result, I removed the civility warning from my talk page, because I use to archive / remove old conversations in my talk page.
Automatically, wen you saw I had removed the civility warning, you blocked me for a 24 hour period.
Your block was absolutely illegitimate, for various reasons:
The way you did it:
The reason you gave to block me was: """"Yes, I've seen the comment on your talk page. This was the combination of mine and his responses to your previous question."""". And few minutes later, you posted """"24 hour block issued"""".
All this information was posted in your own talk page, and talking to another user.
You did not communicate to me that you had blocked me. I did not see that you had blocked me until, few days later the block had expired, I came to your talk page, and saw that you had said that you had blocked me.
In addition, by not communicating me that I was blocked, you did not allow me to ask other admins to review my block.
The reasons why you did it:
It is not stated anywhere in this Wikipedia that an user cannot remove stuff from his talk page.
You neither told me not to remove that stuff.
I accepted and fulfilled your request of having a civil attitude. Ignoring what I had done before (which was not much), since the moment you told me that, I kept a civil attitude.
I also lost my time coming here to reply you, so there is no possible way to say that I ignored your request.
In all, your block was just full of irregularities. It was not a normal admin block, but rather a thoughtless decission that you took without following any kind of procedure. You just decided that I had to be blocked because you might think that removing the civility warning that you had posted in my talk page was some kind of lack of respect towards you. But it is frankly stupid to think that way, because of the reasons I've explained above.
And since you realized that you had comitted an enormous mistake, that you had used your admin powers despotically, you just repeatedly ignored the requests that I did to you in your own talk page, where I asked you why had you blocked me (this one, and this one), adding to your unjustified attitude towards me, a high grade of arrogance.
In addition, you are threatening me. Read well what I wrote:
""""Hello? Why did you block me? Since when removing a civility warning from one's talk page is something that deserves a block? You did not even communicate my block to my talk page. I am stil waiting for a justification of your abusive attitude as admin. You not only block for no reason but you also ignore people's requests of justification!"""".
Where do you see a lack of respect here? Where do you see that I """"keep"""" an uncivil attitude? Honestly, you are the one being uncivil: """"if you carry on in the line you are takng, you will be blocked again"""" ... which line I am takng? And why do you threaten me? """"If you do not wish to contribute constructively to the encyclopedia, then we shall make sure that you do not prevent others from contributing"""" ... oh, """"we"""". This sounds to me more like a street gang threatening a poor pedestrian, than an admin giving wise advices to a poor Wikipedian. Go to my user page and see the articles I've created. Isn't that a positive contribution?
Look: I am not being uncivil; it is you, the one being disrespectful with me. And I am not ignoring your requests of being civil; I am fulfilling them. And it is rather you, who are not only ignoring my requests of justification for the actions you carried out against me, but also threatening me with new repressive measures.  """,0.14285714285714285

They have looked only at the effects of collision on HD+; there are hardly any equations. They are not interested in quantum description of the whole process but only on what happened with the HD+ from which they read about used slit(s). But please respond, does the hellium go through the slits as a wave or as a particle? The Copenhagen interpretation discretizes experiments: during one, it must be either the former or the latter. If it is a particle, then it has a position or momentum during measurement (subject to uncertainty; they """"arise"""" upon measurement, according to orthodox Copenhagen, and arise randomly). Then, there are also things such as momentum transfer etc. which are usual for particles. If it is a wave, however, then it can interfere, and also it can be in many places at a time during measurement. But in this experiment both momentum transfer and wave effects happen during one process of leaving a slit. So please admit that the experiment shows something that is against the orthodox Copenhagen interpretation. Already for this reason it is worth mentioning here(!), but there is one more point.
If you take the Bohm's interpretation (which spreads properties such as charge or mass in space, if the article is not mistaken) and then apply the guiding equation not to one selected point, but to all continuum of points within the orbital, then you can easily explain how can something that acts as a particle go through both slits at a time. The interference pattern will arise due to similar effects as in Huygens' principle; momentum transfers from points (integrated, of course, because normally they will have only something like density of mass and thus density of momentum) will also follow normally. This looks like a quite natural explanation of the phenomenon, especially that photons most likely encounter the same thing when they bounce from shutters between the slits, etc. A very natural explanation is, then, that the apparent """"particle"""", subject to all QED equations etc., acts proportionally """"with its whole body"""" (can be normalized to 99% like with orbitals, so that the body does not extend infinitely in space). Every point follows its own way, when confronted with potentials of external fields, for instance (as in QED), though they have a common wavefunction and this makes them one and the same """"particle.""""
But this emergent interpretation, so natural and obvious, will never be compatible with the Copenhagen interpretation and the like, which assign certain probabilities to different outcomes of a measurement. This is why CI needs the distinction """"acts as a wave""""  """"acts as a particle"""" in experiment; in case of a particle you will have 1 position or momentum, subject to Heisenberg's, and in case of a wave you don't take these into account, so no problem! But never, in CI, you have a continuum of measurements for a certain wave function; because, then, without any collapse in between, ALL POSSIBILITIES would have to occur, otherwise I don't know how do you understand the word """"probability."""" You will not have an explanation why these other points are still """"with"""" the wavepacket and have not flown elsewhere. For such an explanation, you would have to introduce a causal component which actually cancels all your probabilities and, thus, all the individual life of the points of an orbital. This causal component exists in the Bohm's interpretation (applied separately to the points), because the guiding equation will make the points go in such a way that the """"centres of probability"""" are observed in choosing direction, and thus the points will keep close to the orbital, they will not escape.
Thanks for reading this and please restore the paragraph, maybe with some deletions, because it enriches the article and is even easy to understand and admit. Don't hide the facts. 83.9.142.208  """,0.0

Ok, hold up, there's two separate issues here. One is Brevik's use of the term and the other is the side bar.

With regard to the first one, the source appears to be RS. So the question, as with other sources, is whether it just mentions Brevik's use in passing or does it actually use it in context.

With regard to the side bar. I think Altetendekrabbe is correct that the inclusion of the discrimination sidebar is somewhat gratuitous and pov, and that if we include that sidebar we should also include the """"islamophobia"""" side bar and the """"myths"""" sidebar (is there one?). The inclusion of the discrimination side bar is obvious pov because, in sources, the term is described as faulty, insulting, neologism reflecting anti-Muslim sentiment more often than it is described as a proper word reflecting discrimination towards non-Muslims. If anything the """"islamophobia"""" side bar makes more sense then the """"discrimination"""" one. """,0.0

Take a look at the response you got, Verbal. All you had to do was look at my Evidence section at the time you posted that. It was not long, and this page was cited from that section. The editors who responded to you could have told you that, instead they responded with irrelevancies. Which was most of what was posted in that case! Who was responsible for notifying you? You already saw what was posted, and it had, you say, """"inaccuracies."""" Since it was a draft and requested corrections, why didn't you simply respond as requested, at least pointing them out? Now you want to blame (who?) for not notifying you? Yes, I sympathize, that case became a monster, but only because hosts of editors  including yourself  came in with irrelevancies.   
(edit conflict) What a waste of time! Verbal templated me on my Talk page about this speedy, I responded there, please look for it if you need to see it, and above it was a discussion of his request, where I agreed to blank the page. However, when a page is created for and is cited in an RfAr, it is part of the RfAr unless ArbComm decides otherwise. Verbal saw this page then, this can be assumed from his following of the case and his comment in it. He had ample opportunity to correct errors, and this was actively requested on the case evidence page.
Another more general case page, also created in my user space, was MfD'd. (See Verbal's request on my Talk.) It was kept.

 Naruto/Sasuke Yaoi 

Is this really necessary? This is mearly a fandom among female fans. The two characters are obvious not gay in Kishimoto's story and this dose not need a whole section or even a paragraph.  

I dislike Yaoi myself so I distrusted my initial instinct to just do away with it, but prompted by your comment I think I'll just go ahead and act on it. - 

Personally, I'm a great fan of Yaoi, especially of NaruSasu. However, I don't think it has a place on this page. Yaoi pairings exist of practically every male manga character, it's nothing special. The only thing which might make Naruto and Sasuke's relation more special then other Yaoi pairings, is that, for a shounen manga, their relationship is very deep and emotional. Not to mention the enourmous amount of Shounen-ai scenes ^^
Still, even this isn't that special or unique. And it wouldn't justify a seperate section. A small footnote, perhaps...not it's own heading 

Naruto has acknowledged Sasuke as being like a brother to him, so that might change the Yaoi perspective, at least from Naruto's standpoint?

i hate yaoi, but we gotta admit that Naruto's seeming obliviousness toward any female's attraction to him makes him and sasuke prime yaoi-bait

 Sasuke's name? 

Sasuke is named after """"Sarotobi Sasuke"""" or something right? Well I went to the article, and took the kanji characters, and I got two that kind of mean the same thing: help(佐助). So shouldn't this be in the Trivia section? I'm just checking.

Why should Sasuke give a crap about his clan I mean Naruto had it worst then him he didn't have any parents,doesn't have any friends,crappy at jutsu,and suffered from something he didn't cause.Sasuke on the other hand had natural talent, the girls loved him,and if he's going to restore his clan than then whats the fuzz

 Question 

I just have a question. When Sasuke and Naruto fought for the last time, it seemed as though their powers were equally matched. However, does that imply that if Sasuke used a higher level of the Cursed Seal, he would have become more powerful than Naruto even while he was using the Nine-Tails' chakra?

Probably not. I'm pretty sure it's stated in the data books that the Heaven Seal (which Anko and Sasuke both have) is the strongest type of seal, and so far no evidence of anything above Level 2 Cursed Seals exist.  """,0.0

The following is what is currently written in the religion section, which I am fine with. I've combined two of the paragraphs because they have to do with one poll:

Iranians of all religious backgrounds in the United States have comparatively a mix of liberal, conservative and nationalist political leaning and opinions. Iranian-Americans thus are largely secular and tend to practice moderate, less traditional religious forms, but have strong cultural traditions.

According to a 2012 Zogby-PAAIA poll, most Iranian-Americans appear not to practice any particular religion at all, showing many to be irreligious, agnostic and atheist. The poll found the remaining balance split among Muslims, Christians, followers of Judaism, Baha'is and Zoroastrians, with the results as follows: Muslim: 31%, """"No response"""": 15%, Atheist/Realist/Humanist: 11%, Agnostic: 8%, (Irreligious: 34%), Baha’i: 7%, Jewish: 5%, Protestant: 5%, Roman Catholic: 2%, Zoroastrian: 2%, and """"Other"""": 15%.

This is mentioned several times in the play.  I have wondered if any double entendre with the word """"come"""" was intended which would certainly not be surprising among the characters of this play, although nothing of that kind is even hinted at in the dialog and if so that, even as just a title, it passed without comment in 1946. (Then again in 1938 the Cole Porter song My Heart Belongs to Daddy seems to make a subtle reference to cunnilingus (.. to dine on my fine finnan haddie .. asking for more .. etc) without any adverse results.)  There is harsh irony in this since it appears that the opposite is the case, that Hickey's wife was totally faithful and endlessly forgiving of his womanizing and drinking sprees.

Answer: Thank you. - The allegiance that I corrected it to was the 'British Empire', not the UK. The """"Allegiance"""" category in this section applies to Currie's military career, which his WW1 service was the centerpiece of. That conflict was a clash between the British Empire & the German Empire, not Canada vs Germany. Canada declared war on the German Empire in 1914 as a integral part of the British Empire which was threatened as a whole, not as an independent country in isolation. Currie in 1914 would have regarded himself as defending the British Empire, not Canada in isolation, which was under no individual threat from Germany in the least. 

I understand the enthusiasm for Canadian patriotism, but it doesn't really make historical sense to use allegiance to Canada in this context, & it's a mistake to take contemporary sentiments & backdate them onto the past like this, where sentiment was different in these matters.

It would make sense to put military allegiance to the British Empire with that symbol for Currie's martial career, & the Canuck Red Ensign  (great flag, which should be re-introduced today imo, by the way) next to his nationality or birthplace, but putting military allegiance to Canada in the context of WW1 doesn't make contemporary historical sense?

"Coat of Arms of Vermont 
Hi, I presume your request is related to my assessment of the article for the heraldry and vexillology wikiproject. My reasoning was basically that it was too long to be a stub, and didn't have GA status, which meant it had to be either Start or B class; since it was on the short side I went for Start. Having read it once again I can't immediately think of any content which could be added. This is a problem I have with all coat of arms articles; once you've said what it looks like, when it was first used, who designed it and any possible symbolism, there's really not much else you can say unless the arms are old enough that you can trace the historical development. Having said that, it would possibly be interesting to know why the state has both a seal and a coat of arms.

I would however take issue with your statement Vermont is the only U.S. state to have authentic armorial bearings described in a blazon. First, what do you mean by an authentic coat of arms? Are there states which use fake coats of arms? Also given that the arms are an example of landscape heraldry you might find people arguing whether they are actually 'authentic' arms. Secondly, a blazon is just a written description of a coat of arms; given a picture of a coat of arms someone sufficiently experienced in heraldry can produce a blazon, so there's nothing particularly unique about a coat of arms having a blazon. (In the European tradition it is in fact the blazon that defines the arms rather than the visual representation). Thirdly, if you want to get picky, blazon usually refers to the anglo-french jargon used to describe coats of arms, whereas the blazon of the CoA of Vermont is more like a layman's description, although it does throw in a few heraldic terms (I note that the external link you provide refers to the blazon as 'quasi-heraldic terminology'). Finally Vermont is not the only state which has a blazon enshrined in statute, see Coat of arms of North Dakota for example.

Regarding possible improvements, I would be inclined to add subheadings, e.g. history, blazon,Vermonter's badge. Also, now that you've added a couple of other sources it would probably be good to add citations to indicate which facts come from which source. The external link says that the arms were not defined by statute until 1862, but the article says differently; is the external site wrong? Quoting the statute numbers could possibly be useful. A couple more images could also be good, e.g. of the arms being used today, or historical versions showing the 'considerable liberties taken'.",0.0

Once again, User:EconProfessor has insisted on wholesale removal of sourced content because it apparently conflicts with her opinion of Donna Hughes. EconProf summarizes the edit as follows:

""""Removed paragraph that violates NOR, POV. False speculation that email was related to prostitution hearings & was cause of CSPH delay. Sources show CSPH delay was caused by zoning & licensing probs.""""

Sorry, but just because it may reflect negatively on Donna Hughes does not in itself make mention of the incident POV. The sourced articles clearly state that negative attention was brought to Megan Andelloux and the CSPH through the efforts of Donna Hughes. A zoning battle over the CSPH immediately followed, and the zoning issues may or may not have had their own merits. The degree to which Donna Hughes emails and negative publicity played a role is a matter of argument, and I have be quite careful to preface the statement with """"Supporters of Andelloux claim..."""" If there is a way of perhaps rewording the language of the paragraph or introducing more sources to move this paragraph toward one which EconProf feels is more NPOV, I'm open to it.

Edit that Sparked Controversy

There is no consensus for a reverted edit that I made in this article (hereafter the “reverted edit”).  Therefore, I have not changed this article unilaterally back to my previous version, because that would be against consensus.

This reverted edit was reverted by KillerChihuahua (KC) who not only disagreed with it, but also said (in her edit summary) that the edit was disruptive.  I disagree with KC that the edit should have been reverted, for reasons already explained above.  I also disagree with KC that this edit was disruptive, and I will now fully and carefully explain why, for the record. This edit that KC reverted was clearly not redundant to any previous edits made anywhere else at Wikipedia, and thus this edit was not made by me in bad faith as part of any disruptive “edit war”.

This discussion of RCOG’s position on “choice” started at the article on fetal pain, and I moved it here for valid reasons.  At the fetal pain article, KC wrote: """"Please provide a source that this government institution is 'pro-choice' - abortion is legal in the UK, and that the official govt. chartered college are to make that safe is NOT pro choice.""""   I therefore investigated and learned that RCOG is not a government institution, that most of their members live outside the UK, that its governing documents do not specifically limit its activities, that many of its members do not have medical degrees, et cetera.  So, I concluded that the best place to deal with all of this would be here at the article on the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.  Here at the RCOG article, I added quite a bit of info,    in addition to RCOG’s abortion stance. When I was at the fetal pain article and decided to move to this RCOG article, I repeatedly said so in the fetal pain discussion.   I did not sneak over here to try to avoid objections at the fetal pain article.

KC has elsewhere cited five diffs that she says prove this controversial edit was virtually the same as several contested assertions I had made previously. Here are KC’s five diffs: (1) in the fetal pain article, (2) in the fetal pain article, (3) in this RCOG article, (4) in this RCOG article, and (5) in this RCOG article.

None of these five previous edits cited by KC is the same (or virtually the same) as the reverted edit that sparked this controversy.  Both KC’s diff (1) and diff (2) show where I inserted a cite to support another editor’s assertion that RCOG is a “pro-choice group”.  KC pointed out very clearly at the fetal pain article that she did not think RCOG was a “pro-choice group” even though she thought RCOG could have a “pro-choice position” on particular issues:

There is no uncertainty or ambiguity that KC argued RCOG may have a pro-choice",0.0

But if Dürrenmatt was writing in a Swiss-German dialect (which I know almost nothing about other than that German-speakers sometimes have difficulty understanding Swiss German-speakers), these words could have different meanings, and I could be completely wrong.

"""As orignally referred to by Jung - and correctly understood - the so-called 'tertiary' function is also an 'auxiliary' function but I accept that in MBTI-related publications that only the first auxiliary is referred to as such.  In Jung's 'Psychological Types' both are referred to as 'auxiliary' functions so it is not out of place in this article to clarify this difference in how the term is used.             

My concern about using """"auxiliary"""" to describe the tertiary function has nothing to do with its correctness with respect to Jung's writing. In the context of this article, I believe it does more to create confusion than to add value. So for the sake of the reader, I believe it's better left out.

Just above that discussion is Where I once again mentioned to another editor , reasons for having to establish a separate page , because my content on the Gakhar page pertaining to existing population of Gakhar Hindus was persistently and aggressively and unfairly deleted . Finally to avoid  edit warring I started the new page .
How horrendous then that you present abject lies on this page ,
when you  allude to me  The fact that the countries were split in the 1940s does not impact on a communal history that extends for a much, much longer time . Because my edits were assaulted out from the Gakhar page for making exactly this  point Exactly the point  to begin with . See  this because this and this.

 Metasemiotics 

As a journal editor myself, I often hear complaints from authors whose articles were rejected that """"the reviewer did not understand what we were writing"""". The answer is simple: this usually means that the article was not written intelligibly. I have nothing against metasemiotics, but an article that cannot be understood by the average reader will not be of much use to Wikipedia. Honestly, I could make head nor tail of that article. Material published in my own journal could not be placed in Wikipedia without heavy editing either. So my proposal for speedy deletion of your article is no reflection on the quality of the academic journals that you listed. It's just a reflection of the fact that you did not succeed in conveying what metasemiotics is about in generally understandable words. Apparently I was not the only one feeling this way, as the article was deleted by an admin who apparently agreed with me (I am not an admin and therefore cannot delete articles myself). In any case, it was only a speedy delete, so nothing prevents you from trying again. Please keep in mind in that case the public or which you are writing. Happy editing!   """,0.0

References, for one. Two college newspaper citations and two MySpaces doesn't cut it. I tried to look for some myself, but google yielded very few related hits. More than ten minutes of recorded output, for another. A label. Right now, the whole thing smacks of blatant self-promotion, and that isn't what Wikipedia is for.

Unfortunately he's wrong. Generally all votes are counted (twice) by midnight. Then the preliminary final results are announced and the candidates who won are contacted so they can state whether they accept their seats or not. They have a week to reply and then the final results are announced; it's got nothing to do with counting votes for a week (btw. the final result of the election as a whole can take even more time because somtimes some precincts vote later than the other.

Hi. It's from the same user who was changing the images before on similar articles. Not to mention that, both images are good resolutions, contrary to what the user says, which is why I don't see the need to change images, delete galleries and remove content. It's unnecessary.   
It is nevertheless a content dispute. Neither the repeated switching of images nor the edit summaries that you consider misleading amount to vandalism, per Wikipedia:Vandalism#Types of vandalism and Wikipedia:Vandalism#What is not vandalism.  Donald Albury 

It was vandalism, but not mine.  Your images have extremely bad lighting and are not encyclopedic quality in the least.  One of them replaced a photo of a street in the article for that street Brickell Avenue and doesn't even show the street.  THE ARTICLE IS ABOUT THE STREET.  Also, you're supposed to answer a talk on the same page (Yours') that it initiated on, not put the answer on the initiators page so there are 2 half conversations on two separate pages.  I suggest you read a bit more about Wikipedia rules and stop vandalizing articles with your crappy poor lighting amateur photography from car windows.  66.176.139.222  """,0.14285714285714285

"This plot description is much superiorcomments? 

“Joliet” Jake Blues is released from the Joliet Correctional Center after serving three years of a prison sentence after being convicted of armed robbery. Jake is irritated at being picked up by his brother Elwood in a battered former Mt. Prospect, Illinois police car, instead of the Cadillac The Blues Brothers used to own. 

The Blues Brothers visit their childhood home, a Roman Catholic orphanage, Saint Helen-of-the-Blessed-Shroud Orphanage. From Sister Mary Stigmata (Kathleen Freeman), The Blues Brothers learn that a property tax lien on the orphanage property will be foreclosed upon unless five thousand dollars in property taxes is remitted on its behalf to the county (the associated church has elected instead to sell the building to the Board of Education rather than pay the tax assessment). At the advice of their childhood mentor, Curtis (Cab Calloway), The Blues Brothers attend an evangelical church service at Triple Rock Baptist Church, led by the Reverend Cleophus James (James Brown), where Jake has an epiphany: The Blues Brothers can legitimately raise the funds by re-forming their rhythm and blues band, The Blues Brothers’ Band.
  
As The Blues Brothers drive past a doughnut shop and Nelson Funeral Home in the Bluesmobile, Elwood’s driving alerts two Illinois State Police troopers, Trooper Daniel (Armand Cerami) and Trooper Mount (Steven Williams), who, after pursuing The Blues Brothers into a quiet, secluded residential area, learn from their in-car SCMODS (State-County-Municipal Offender Data System) computer terminal of Elwood’s suspended driver's license. When Trooper Daniel and Trooper Mount attempt to place Elwood under arrest, Elwood speeds off, escaping by driving and crashing through, with the Illinois State Troopers in pursuit, the Dixie Square Mall. 

After parking the Bluesmobile in an alley-end compartment next to a high-voltage transformer (hence the Bluesmobile’s remarkable magical abilities) and arriving at Elwood’s home, a hotel for transients, The Blues Brothers are mysteriously unharmed from a bazooka attack launched by a mystery woman (Carrie Fisher). The next morning, just as the Illinois State Troopers who attempted to arrest Elwood the previous evening, with the help of Parole officer Burton Mercer (John Candy) as to the true address of “the elegant abode of one Elwood Blues” (because Elwood had ‘falsified his renewal’ and ‘put down ten sixty West Addison’, the street address of Wrigley Field) attempt to serve an arrest warrant at Elwood’s tiny room, the mystery woman detonates a bomb that demolishes the building, which inadvertently saves The Blue Brothers from another attempted arrest.

Elwood proceeds to his “straight job”, on the assembly line at an aerosol-can manufacturer, takes several cans from the line and places them in his briefcase, and visits the plant manager, quitting his job, citing a decision to become a priest (curiously, Elwood’s supervisor’s office is adorned with a U.S. flag and an Illinois state flag, suggesting that the aerosol-can manufacturer in an enterprise owned by the government of the State of Illinois—or else simply that Elwood’s supervisor thought it would be cool to adorn his office with a U.S. flag and an Illinois flag).

Jake and Elwood begin tracking down members of the band. Trombonist Tom “Bones” Malone and the rhythm section of the group (Willie “Too Big” Hall, Steve “The Colonel” Cropper, Donald “Duck” Dunn, and Murphy “Murph” Dunné) known as “Murph and the Magictones”, are playing in an empty Holiday Inn lounge, “The Armada Room”, and are readily convinced to rejoin The Blues Brothers’ Band. Trumpeter “Mister Fabulous” (Alan Rubin), now maître d' at a restaurant, is more of a challenge to persuade (“you ain′t never gonna get ’em outta those high-payin’ gigs”), but Jake and Elwood rudely convince him with some dining-room hijinks. En route to meet saxophonist Louis “Blue Lou” Marini and guitarist Matt “Guitar” Murphy, The Blues Brothers drive through a rally of neo-Nazis (upon whom Jake comments “Illinois Nazis—I hate Illinois Nazis!”) and adding another enemy to the The Blues Brothers’ growing list of pursuing parties. Marini and Murphy are working at the soul food restaurant on Maxwell Street, in Calumet City, Illinois, which Murphy owns with his wife (Aretha Franklin). Against her advice, the two musicians leave and rejoin the band. The reunited group obtain new musical instruments and associated equipment from Ray (Ray Charles) of Ray’s Music Exchange, in Calumet City, Illinois, on loan, pending payment from the proceeds of The Blues Brothers’s Band’s pending ‘triumphant return’.

Hi, are you still interested in the PHP code of my bot? Due to some general discontent with the attitude of some Wikipedia users (as stated on my user page) I've been away from WP for a while, so I didn't respond immediately.
The core of my bot is a library (PHP include file) that offers a function to fetch a specified WP page, and one that can save a page to WP again. In between, you can do any processing of the page you want. I currently have functionality for adding stub tags (sounds similar to what you want, if I understand correctly) and putting a page on AfD, both including user interface pages. User account authentication is currently hardcoded, so you'll either have to copy the info from your cookies into the code or extend it with something nicer.

"Cabalist team of sysops/users undermines WP’s reliability  promoting Greek nationalistic POV 
A well collaborated group of 3 WP sysops and 8 WP users has been spotted working systematically in full daily basis to promote ultra natioanalistic Greek POV. They intervene in any related  new articles, make Greek POV edits, edit wars, reverts, deletions, block users, merges and redirects. Their main target is political articles about Rebublic of Macedonia, Turkey, Bulgaria, Albania, their minorities in Greece and Greek history. 

Khoikhoi (sysop) and Future Perfect at Sunrise (sysop)  recently deleted article: Voden inscription, and protected articles as Minorities in Greece and Bulgarian Human Rights in Macedonia. They also redirected new articles as  Bulgarian minority in Greece to Minorities of Greece, Bulgarians in Greece to Minorities in Greece and Tarlis incident  to Treaty of Sevres without warning and discussion. 

All  redirects don’t  allow traces . Practically this action is equivalent to speady deletion because redirected articles are not included to target articles and  prevents recreating them under same name.

Slim is not a """"he"""". Given that she named herself after a Javanese princess, perhaps you could take the hint and note that she's a woman. Also, I don't think you were simply blunt. I think you were rude to Slim. I recognise it's a fine line but given that I've mentioned it to you, perhaps you'll take more care to stay on the right side of it?

She has suggested in an email to me, that she is in talks with another editor. Now, I don't know who this other editor and i certainly don't like this secrecy. Instead of having a discussion on this, she wants to finish the matter begind closed doors. She could've atleast told me who this reputed editor was to let me have a word with him/her.

Perhaps she is seeking guidance on how she should approach you and wants that to be untainted by your input. I think that would be reasonable. I have a high regard for Slim and I don't think she would have a nefarious purpose in speaking to a third party.

Inso far as the images are concerned, I had stated to her a couple of images on one issue (animal rights) is ok, but she insists she needs to showcase the entire album provided by PETA and its assocites.

So you have a dispute. You need to recognise that you are not necessarily right! You disagree about how many images are necessary. I feel that you have to allow that your disagreement might be fuelled by your political differences as much as how you interpret the image policy.

This should could easily achieve by providing an external link to the images provided by a controversial organization.

The BUAV is not a """"controversial organisation"""". It is a highly respected body, whose voice is listened to in all circles of British society. A viewpoint doesn't become """"controversial"""" just because you don't share it.

Wikipedia is supposed to be neutral and not have extreme viewpoints - 

But you expect it to reflect your viewpoint.

thus I requested her to limit her fair use policy in this regard to 2-3 images which can be used across similar articles. this she refuses.

I don't see how it is any fairer to use one, two or ten images in this instance. While I agree that Slim could have taken more care to provide a rationale for using the images, I simply don't feel that your argument about how many she should have used has much weight. One factor in deciding fair use is how much of a thing you use, that's true, but it's only one factor, and obviously, each picture is a separate case to be considered as well as part of a whole.

As far as the other images, some are on personalities she claims have """"agreed"""" to use their photos here. Unless she gets a written consent and a permission how can I believe.

First of all, you can believe Slim because you assume good faith. Perhaps you're not aware of that policy. Yes, you can ask Slim to provide evidence of that, but your assumption should be that she has in fact acquired that agreement. Harassing another editor to provide evidence to your satisfaction and insisting you won't believe them until they have do not show an assumption of good faith.

Once I pointed out that {permission} photos would be deleted anyway, she backed off and argued that it be kept on the grounds of fair use asking me to trust her.

Yes, okay. Trust her AND ask for proof.

Both of us are editing in good faith, but one of us has power and a circle of friends to back her while the other (me) relies on the hope that ppl. like you will help me out in this.

I'd urge you to rely on the issues rather than the personalities. Yes, Slim does have powerful friends, who will back her regardless, but you should still do your best to make it about the issue in question and not about her.

If she gets away with this and sets a precedence then I'm afraid there are hordes of copyviolaters straining at the leashes to bomb Wikipedia with copyrighted information.

''I think that's a bit dramatic but I agree that she has to obey the rules, which exist for good reason, and shouldn't be given a pass just because she is friends with the arbcom. However, she is not a """"copyviolater"""" trying to destroy Wikipedia. Partly, I think she simply didn't understand your problem, and that was in part a failure of your communication, and partly she has become too used to having her views echoed by her friends and doesn't handle disagreement well. So perhaps you could recognise that and be more helpful than combative? I know",0.0

 I'm not seeing what points readers to Hotchkiss in popular culture. Please clarify.

If the section is called """"Hotchkiss in Print"""" then maybe movie references are not appropriate here, or the section should be renamed.

As to your point about """"disgruntled alums:"""" Whether the quotations are positive or negative is immaterial. If they are references in print and they shed light on the history and reputation of the school, then the quotations seem entirely appropriate here. Would we want to include every last mention of Hotchkiss in the written record? Perhaps not. However, below are reasons for including quotes I have recently added (actually, re-added because they were removed at some point).

Thomas Hoving quotation: Hoving is one of the more notable alums, a longtime director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. As a public figure who is also an alum, his perspective on the school is significant. McPhee is also a leading writer of profiles and this piece originally appeared in the New Yorker. So, it's authoritative.

The Cullman quotation: I believe Cullman was chairman of the board of trustees, and the Cullman family has been one of the school's major supporters. Since Cullman is an alumnus and a prominent supporter, his comments on the school are worth noting.

Julian Houston is a judge in Massachusetts. As a successful legal professional, an alumnus, and a person of color, who has written a book that is clearly based on his experience at the school, it is appropriate to quote him on his time at the school.

Archibald MacLeish is among the school's most prominent alumni. Because of his stature, his comments on the school are notable.

Lemisch is both an alumnus and an emeritus history professor, who has written an article on the history of Hotchkiss. Because he is an alum and a historian, and because the subject of this article is the history of the school, a quotation from it is notable.

The above reasons support the relevance of these quotations to this article.

If there are other quotes by prominent alums who enjoyed their time at Hotchkiss, of course those would be worth citing here as well. """,0.0

Herbeck/von Herbeck
Hi, James,  Well, I think there are three separate questions:
 The two articles I merged were most definitely about the same person, unless 2 people with virtually the same name, the same nationality, working in the same field, shared exactly the same day of birth and exactly the same day of death.  Technically possible, but extraordinarily unlikely, I would suggest.  
  Now, there may indeed have been another Johann Herbeck who worked around that time, but I'm no expert and I've never heard of such person.
 As to why the Bruckner biographies have him as Herbeck and not von Herbeck, it's probably because he got his """"von"""" only in 1874, three years before his death.  For the great bulk of his life, he was simply Herr Herbeck, so it's appropriate to refer to him that way in a biog of another person.  For an encyclopedia article, however, he gets his full final name.  

This is a very handy source for some further updates to the article.  Cheers.      """,0.0

 Templates 
Sorry for not getting back sooner, and in fact I will for now address only one of our ongoing topics because I have a lot going on currently.
I've made a very preliminary first attempt at the templates , going through 1947. The issues I have are:
1. Technical problem: the brackets appear around the Radical Party.
2. Lots of red links. For now, I think I'd prefer de-linking them until we have articles.
3. Fitting some of the parties into categories, particularly the more obscure ones, and the ones that clearly might belong to two–the Ploughmen's Front, the German Party, etc. I will need help with this.
4. With reference to both the categories and individual parties, should they be in a particular order?
I put electoral alliances in italics and """"important"""" (a vague term, I know) parties in bold. You're free to work within my sandbox to whatever extent you wish, until we come to a clearer consensus.  """,0.0

Male graduates before 1969 
I've added mention to the 'trivia' section regarding men who matriculated at vassar immediately after world war II on the GI bill. I suppose this could be classified as 'original research', not sure. My father was in that first graduating class that included men (eleven of them). A scan of the relevant portion of the program from the graduation ceremonies can be found here . again, if this constitutes original research, i guess it can be pulled, though it is a rather fascinating bit of history.  

 Bias 

There are many abundantly clear examples of bias in this article: “Vassar is often praised for its beautiful campus, a 1000 acre (4 km?) lot of land marked by period and modern buildings that is also an arboretum; since that time, it has maintained its reputation as one of America's outstanding liberal arts colleges, and is especially noted for its tolerant social atmosphere; the college is a member of the """"Little Ivies,"""" an unaffiliated group of elite northeastern liberal arts colleges; Vassar is a leader in producing doctoral candidates; Vassar students are well known for their individuality, creativity, and open-mindedness; many beautiful old brick buildings are scattered throughout the bucolic campus, but there are also several modern and contemporary structures worth noting.""""  Did this come straight from the College’s website?   

 Bias ? 

I disagree with the above allegation of bias in the article.  I found no similarity between the Vassar Web site and the article.  The information in question - the attractiveness of the campus - seems fairly innocuous and is fairly similar to the type of information in Wikipedia articles about other liberal arts colleges and several universities.  The article reads like synopsis of commercially available background information in colleges guide books.  While I would have written the main paragraph differently, I hardly think this qualifies as biased, and without some criteria to differentiate this page from other pages on other schools, I believe the objection should be removed from this page.

The article violates Wikipedia's NPOV policy, clearly.  Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, a place to find innformation, not a forum for opinions.  If you are unwilling to make changes, then I will go ahead and make them myself.  Also, you should leave you name when commenting.   

Also, I realize that the article is not up to date and violates Wikipedia's policy against personal research (ie, students spend time doing ceratin activities on a certain lawn).   

I do agree that much of the information on this page is somewhat biased. And the architectural info came from me, not the college's website - so, my apologies for lack of """"neutrality"""" there. However, if you edit the page to remove said """"bias"""", please re-read your edits before saving the page. Simply removing phrases and not doing a little copyedit makes the page read poorly. I have made some minor edits just so that it reads a little cleaner, hopefully not restoring anything that you feel is biased. I think the bigger issue is that this page has become a series of lists (academic majors, famous alums, residence halls) with little encyclopedic content and is an embarrasment compared to other articles about comparable schools. Someone please help to fix this article!  """,0.0

Greetings!! You described yourself as Pandeist in the discussion on the images used for 'God'  I too consider myself one. How rare a thing, I have discovered, to meet a fellow Pandeist. I feel this has been a fortuitous day, as if our Universe has conspired to have us meet. ;)

As you have an interest in this topic, perhaps you can translate some of the material from our own Pandeism page to its rather sparse Romanian counterpart. Sadly, our own article has recently been the recipient of an exclusionist hatchet job, which included (as part of the harsh medicine imposed) the separation of the article into Pandeism and God becomes the Universe. But the material in the later article is obviously still about Pandeism, and ought to be included in an article honestly addressing that topic. Blessings!!",0.0

 Editing of Anthony Hungerford 

Dear Phillip,

               My comments regarding your editing of this site are not hostility, they are upset!
I have only ever place three entries onto Wikipadia, and am the first to acknowledge that I have not made myself fully aware to the protocols of the site. After some 30 years of researching my ancestry, my primary aim was to share the information garnered on those few individuals who have been somewhat prominent in history.

My upset comes from the fact that the editing was not sympathetic. You seem to have just wiped the article and started again. 
The upshot was that instead of leaving the information on the page [after all it has been there for some time-what is the rush to change it?] and asking for clarification, certain aspects just disappeared.

If I understand it correctly, it seems that Wikipedia prefers to quote as a source from the Calendars of State Papers – because a contributor to DNB or ODNB [a secondary source] has seen it, and delete my other quote from the Calendar of State Papers with source reference-because I have seen it personally in a printed book of the Calendars?

Likewise, as I mentioned to you in my email, it was obvious that the authors of both the old DNB and the ODNB did not actually know the origins of Colonel Hungerford-they both speculated. Whereas my later research had got nearer to the truth with my finding details given by Colonel Hungerford to the Ulster Herald, when he arrived in Ireland with his Regiment –which you confirmed with the full reference –

•TABDublin: National Library of Ireland, Genealogical Office: Ms.45, pp.59-60: """"Certificate of Arms to Col. Anthony Hungerford of Marson in Wiltshire and his pedigree. He arrived with his Regiment in D]ublin, April 30, 1647.""""
•TABDublin: National Library of Ireland, Genealogical Office: Ms.45, p.62 Certificate of Arms and cadency to Ensign St. John Hungerford, third brother of and ensign to Col. Anthony Hungerford, May 12, 1647.

I apologise if I have been too harsh in my comments to you, but you must understand that it was basic sourced information, which at the time was not on the internet, that I was seeking to share with Wikipedia readers, not style, rules and display.
I hope you have not finished with your editing. If you require any further clarifications please contact me.

But 2/0 has, unfortuntely (past experiences suggests he's a decent fellow) been quite active along with Jehochman in carrying out a reign of censorship against those with opinions they don't share. This abusive behavior is damaging to the encyclopedia and is anti-intellectualism of the worst kind, but not much different the Climategate nonsense we've seen. Dishonest, misleading, misinformation campaigns like these are very harmful to the pragmatic solutions to protect the environment, so it's pretty disheartening that somemthing I'm involved in, Wikipedia, is being abused to this extent. The dishonest manipulation of sources, the smearing, and the bullying cabalism are very discouraging. But the world is not a perfect place. I smiled at a few of the discussions on your page. Your good cheer, good faith and patience is an inspiration.

Is there proof that that was still Tobi, or are people just assuming this? If people are, then also assume that Tobi might have been killed and it's an impostor.

"Moved to draft space==
I've moved this copypasted pastiche to draft space as it wasn't ready for mainspace.   A few points to remember:

There is nothing to split from the cuisine of Hawaii article.  Splitting occurs when we have too much content and some must be moved elsewhere.  That is not the situation here.  There is nothing to remove from the parent topic.  
What was recommended is for an editor to take up the task of expanding the subject, spinning out the topic into a new daughter article.  This involves an editor who is willing and interested to research and write about the cuisine of Native Hawaiian and to give it an expanded scope and treatment in a larger space.  This means expanding what we already have, not moving it to another article and adding more copypaste from other articles.  Writing means, doing the research, reading the books and scholarly papers, and doing the hard work.  It does not mean taking what we already have and duplicating it over and over again.  That's not how this works.
You basically duplicated the entire cuisine of Hawaii article here.  Since that's a completely different topic, it makes no sense to talk about ethnic and local cuisine here.  If you don't know what the cuisine of Native Hawaii entails, then do the research.  It does not mean any food that anyone of Native Hawaiian ethnicity eats.  It has a specific, pre-contact definition and scope.
When you copied the content, you also copied the sources without adding the actual references.  As a result,  nobody can easily verify the content.  Of course, I can, since I'm the one that went to the library and found the books and cited them in the original article.  You will have to add each full source to this article, otherwise it will get moved back to draft/sandbox space again.  You can't just keep copying material without doing the hard work.  You will need to add each single full reference to this article.  Don't expect others to cleanup after you, especially when other editors did the actual research and footwork you refuse to do.
Per the MOS, please do not surround text with multiple images.  Candleabracadabra, you've been reminded of this many times now.  

Keep this in draft space until you've done the necessary work.  This will involve serious research on your part. It will not involve copying and pasting material from already existing articles.

There are some sketchy things going on with this talk page. All this text recommending deletion was mysteriously archived a few days after it was posted - while everything else on the talk page remained there for nine months. I cut and pasted it again here last week, and -voila!- the same text recommending deletion was archived again today! Hmmm... Anyway, these above entries are nice reports, though unfortunately they do not add much to the questions on notability. The concept of notability must be established through certain types of references (regardless of a person's opinion of the individual). The question is why/how does these references establish notability? If he's interviewed about something, that establishes the notability of the subject of the interview. Rather than saying """"this seems to me to [this or that]"""" - responses on this topic need to be """"this reference establishes/fails to establish notability because..."""" The further one reads into the wiki explanations about notability for people, these cites for Raymond do not have material that is even close:
The person has received a well-known and significant award or honor, or has been nominated for one several times. The person has made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in his or her specific field. Generally, a person who is """"part of the enduring historical record"""" will have been written about, in depth, independently in multiple history books on that field, by historians. A politician who has received """"significant press coverage"""" has been written about, in depth, independently in multiple news feature articles, by journalists. An actor who has been featured in magazines has been written about, in depth, independently in multiple magazine feature articles, by magazine article writers. An actor or TV personality who has """"an independent biography"""" has been written about, in depth, in a book, by an independent biographer. 
This Raymond page is obviously someone's baby, and someone who's account was removed due to sockpuppeting was posting on this talk page last year. That doesn't mean that Raymond shouldn't have a wikipedia page. But the references here don't add up to notability as notability has been described by wikipedia.  """,0.0

"""An admittedly biased source, but with more or less first hand information, is the Chabad group which just smuggled (or at least claims to have) matzoh from [the] Ukraine to Iran for the Passover holiday. The news article states that """"Members of the Chabad organization smuggled a huge quantity of matzot into Iran last week in order to enable local Jews in the Islamic Republic to celebrate the Passover  according to tradition.""""

""""Some 20,000 Jews currently live in Iran. The authorities allow them freedom to practice their religion, but forbid the import of Israel-made products to the country, an act that could cost a person three years imprisonment or the revoking of his passport for five years."""" 

While they probably didn't get an exact census of the people they were delivering to, I'd guess that they at least got the number reasonably correct. So 20,000 seems to be the way to go.

 IPA - what 

I read the main page of the article on IPA.
On the plus side it is clear.
On the minus side, it makes no attempt to explain what the IPA is.  (context, scope, purpose, etc.)
Nice chart.  Lots of data (for people who probably have no need of it) but virtually no general information.
My questions (which weren't answered - keep in mind I'm a totally lay person):
An alphabet is used to 1.  Communicate between a writer and a reader (of the same language), 2.  Describe that communication (unambigously?)  Right?

Certain things are implied by its name, but clearly one should define what the subject of the alphabet is (are).  I have no idea if it covers all indoeuropean languages not to mention Mandarin Chinese (etc.)?
Does it (attempt) to cover all spoken languages? Written?  What about non-vocal languages (finger snaps - all that stuff).  Sign-language?  We now have some evidence that hand gestures are linked to language in the brain...but I digress.  From a simplistic point of view language can be thought of as being three distinct (context sensitive) types of communication: written/read, spoken/heard and performed/viewed.  I suppose an alphabet can't cover the last (but see how choreographers describe dance) and, obviously, there are non-alphabetical languages (pictographics, heiroglyphic, etc.) just as there are languages which make use of whistles, clicks.  SO what does the IPA do?

It just occured to me that maybe the IPA is (now-a-days) only used by euro-centric hobbyists and that would explain why there was no attention given to giving a serious explanation of what it is: """"if you have to ask...{then you don't need to know}""""""",0.0

"So...that's definitely a possible fundamental group of a 3-manifold.  But if you consider all the other conditions of the fibering conjecture, it's not allowed.  H_1 infinite means there's a non-separating surface; irrreduciblity means it can't be a sphere.  Compressing the surface gives a pi_1-injective surface, so the 3-manifold group contains a surface subgroup, which can't be the case if it's the integers (since the sphere is excluded).

Actually, the conclusion that the manifold fibers implies that the group contains a surface subgroup.  The surface can't be a sphere (because of irreducibility), so we have a more complicated surface whose fundamental group injects into the fundamental group of the 3-manifold.",0.0

For the record, I have had my disagreements with him and I certainly don't approve of everything he's done here (I'm sure he feels the same way, and that's fine). I don't wish to be an apologist (for any side) and excuse everything that's happened, but I'm trying to find a way forward. I wish, for instance, that he would find it easier to let bygones be bygones (I think I'm paraphrasing GiantSnowman, from an AN thread about a proposed Iban between the two of them, and I wish KF had accepted that from GS). Anyway, this message is longer than I intended it to be, and I apologize for that. I suppose I'm also asking you if (or when) you can let bygones be bygones. There's no immediate urgency for you to respond; if you could ping me when you do, if you do, I'd appreciate it.For the talk page stalkers: please let's not turn this into ANI. I could have emailed Horologium privately, but I prefer to do this here, in between the privacy of email and the dramah of a board.

OK, first, when you have a specific question, type {{helpme}} on your talk page and ask the question.  Second, all articles must show notability, using verifiable and independent reliable sources.

 14.29 - first unarmed officers arrive at the scene, establishing a cordon and waiting behind it for the armed response

If correct, this seems normal to me. Armed police are not common, even in London.

Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of items of information. That something is 100% true does not mean it is suitable for inclusion in an encyclopedia. While there is a continuing debate about the encyclopedic merits of several classes of entries, current consensus is that Wikipedia articles are not:
Directories, directory entries, or a resource for conducting business. For example, an article on a radio station generally shouldn't list upcoming events, current promotions, phone numbers, etc (although mention of major events or promotions may be acceptable). Furthermore, the Talk pages associated with an article are for talking about the article, not for conducting the business of the topic of the article.
This page is about homosexuality in Singapore, NOT a directory of where you can go to make out with other men in Singapore if you're a gay! That information is too trivial and non-encyclopedic to be included here.

"""I am coming at this as an outsider. Here are my observations:

An article like this can show many different theories and still remain POV. The idea isn't to exclude information (such as some theories), but to provide as much information as possible (such as adding more theories). WegianWarrior explains it well: """"Wikipedia isn't about whats valid or not, its about what can be verified. It's a verfiable fact that these claims are made by a number of conspiracy theorists."""" And Blueboar's statement (""""If a source discusses directly the theories that are the topic of this article, it does belong ... no matter what its viewpoint on the theory"""") is valid and useful in this discussion.

Ukufwakfgr, your incivility diminishes greatly the legitimacy of any argument you make. It would be more effective if you left out the abrasive language and cries of flamebaiting and focused only on how to improve the article. By providing a list of what needs to be fixed, removed and added (without being abrasive), other editors will be much more likely to work with you. For example, if you think parts need further toning-down, quote the current sentence as it appears in the article and then provided what you think would be a better way to say it. You're going to have to play nice or not play at all.

Lastly to all, please review Staying cool when the editing gets hot and Civility. Even if you feel you are on the correct side of an issue here, sarcasm and curtness aren't going to help. Insults and abrasive language is not congruent to the way things work around here.

 Working It Out Tour 2010-2011 

The Working it out Tour started in 2010 with Traci K Shoop taking it to the next level of fitness.  By adding music with muscle and modeling.  She presented herself through the east coast and some west promoting health and music.  Presented in part for association FPLA to raise money  helping with her in transition and team artists and athletes become members to showcase to be promoted.  Traci's music was a hit on her teaser song Kiss me love me...with holiday added starting in December featuring her very first christmas album """" Tis the Season to be Sexy"""".  This album earned her credentials for a peoples choice nomination where voted amongst some of the top pop artists like Susan Doyle and Mariah Carey.  In this tour she went around presenting a way to help with hard times by giving back to support her coming back out from supporting the troops.  It landed her even top awards with Karaoke social networks. When making the top charts in with her """" Be My Santa BAby"""" it inspired her to bring out for the tour for kisses with the United States Entertainment organization with the service members.  With allowing her to get a chance to mission to meet and greet soldiers during the war time to give morale and become a long distance pen pal.  She herself committed 14 years as a spouse and served under contract training soldiers and families during the times when most effected by stress and abandonment.  Traci's goal as an artist and pro athlete was to bring as many people on the team to help with promoting them during transitional times asking other non service artists who were working to try and contribute financially or through contributions.  But to also honor the ones who like her served not under combat but through missions and it earned her loyality pin, coins and awards with national congressional committes. Where she placed on the board. The true inspiration to push to try and break from the low income of serving and being honored and recognized truly with demanding to be heard.  This tour was of course a struggle with many of the financial reasons and not allowing to spread the truth of what really goes on and how it effects families.  The way some are not truly appreciated on both ends when helping while others in the entertainment receive huge amounts of money and media exposure with little to ever be left for the ones who also work for their freedom.  To also showcase true health and fitness through the arts and science of things.  Which actually helped land her first emmy nomination in two categories in 2010.  

And also nominations with the carolina music awards and the independent music awards.

Villaged, if the information is included in a footnote, it's not missing from the article.

I have no doubt that some users edit this article in an attempt at apologetics and to make Smith look as good as possible. I have no doubt that some users edit it to discredit Smith and make him look as bad as possible. (There are also many who attempt neither, of course, and try to be """"fair"""".) I've seen editors throw accusations at each other both ways on issues such as this, and it tends to go nowhere and doesn't really help things. I find that for each individual editor, it's best if I just assume good faith, even when I know that there will in fact be some percentage of them who edit in bad faith. When I disagree with a particular editor on an editing issue, it's just not fair for me to assume that they are editing in bad faith, because I think most of them will not be.  (talk) """,0.0

wikipedia entry on ten-string guitar can no longer be considered reliable 

It has been a battle to keep the wikipedia entry on """"ten-string guitar"""" from being turned into the usual farce that one expects of the """"information"""" presented in both wikipedia and most sites that purport to be about the 10-string guitar (both being 'littered with inaccuracies' and even deliberate misinformation). 

For the time being, I must devote my energies to the final stages of my Doctoral studies and let the fools play at being pseudo-musicologists on wikipedia. It is, however, a disgrace that the first two pages through which most online readers are introduced to """"the ten-string guitar"""" (that is wikipedia and Janet Marlow's tenstringguitar(dot)com) are riddled with inaccuracies, untenable claims, and (as shown in a previous blog) even deliberate distortion of Narciso Yepes's words in an attempt to misrepresent the historical and scientific facts of the matter.

Since I've spoken out about this disinformation, I note that my main page here has suspiciously been deleted from most google search listings containing the terms """"10-string guitar"""" or """"ten-string guitar"""". Some of our American """"colleagues"""" evidently don't like the truth coming out about their dishonest """"scholarship"""".

As for wikipedia, be advised that I no longer oversee the accuracy of the """"ten-string guitar"""" page and this should now be considered as unreliable as most of the other misleading ten-string guitar sites. The person presently responsible for the (from a musicological/organological point of view) misinformative wikipedia entry is Andrew Alder, whose musical """"expertise"""" as far as I can gather is limited to playing drums and rhythm guitar in his local Sydney Anglican church. Yet he too deems himself an """"authority"""" who is in a position to """"educate"""" readers about the 10-string guitar (an instrument he has no doubt never played).  

It is exactly this problem with wikipedia (that any lay person can edit it and can even become an administrator if they have too much free time on their hands and are willing to kiss enough derriere) that has caused it to be banned by universities and to be blamed for """"making kids dumb"""" and for falling grades of students who turn to this misinformative online """"encyclopaedia"""" for research.

 Understanding how to write Wikipedia articles 

You are obviously a single-purpose account, contributing only to Ashwant Dwivedi. The chances are high that either you are that person, you are related to him or you know him personally. In any event, you are pretty consistently making a mess of things at the article and I'm struggling to clean up the problems that you create. It's not a vendetta against you as a person, though.

There is little doubt in my mind that you would benefit from contributing to a wider range of articles in order to gain exposure to how we actually write things here. There is, for example, no rationale for including every news story that you can find about a person - especially not when they are trivial soundbites or repetitive information - nor is there any need to misrepresent sources by saying he is a """"Pacific Islands Diplomat"""" when, at best, he was a Fijian one. Things like this would be more obvious to you if you were not so constrained by your self-imposed concentration on one article. They would also be more obvious if you actually tried discussing things with other people and listening to what they say. I'm not always right but I am pretty experienced here and, as with anything in life, one key way to learn is to pick up things from those who have done it before.

I'm absolutely fed up with you at the moment, having given you a massive amount of rope over many months. But I'm quite happy to let bygones by bygones if only you can actually demonstrate a willingness to develop your skills here. The article will, in my opinion, be deleted anyway but there is much else here that you could work on in the future if you are prepared to spend a bit of time understanding how Wikipedia works. I rather suspect that we could use more decent contributors for Fiji-related subjects, for example. -   """,0.0

 Definition of Managment Consulting 

I've modified the paragraph discussing the types of firms to use the more narrow term """"strategy consulting"""" rather than """"management consulting"""".

Managment consulting currently has a very broad meaning.  IT, intellectual property management, law, and accounting all involve choices that can have a profound effect on the opportunities and resources of an organization.  In current usage it seems that the term """"management consulting"""" refers to any sort of consulting activity that

 has strategic implications for the future
 requires senior or upper level managment champions and buy in

To distinguish a Bain from a PWC we need to focus on difference between strategy and implementation.  Strategic IT, strategic IP management, and management accounting and other """"new"""" forms of consulting all have a blend of implementation and strategy in common.

I think what distinguishes a Bain from a PWC is Bain's exclusive focus on the strategic elements of a problem.  Bain will tell you why you need to do something and some general ideas of how given your current resources but leave the rest to you.  Firms like PWC and  Proudfoot have built their reputation on taking at least joint responsibility for the implementation.

"Point one: The anomalous status of Palestinian refugees and of UNRWA is a result of historical contingency, not some imagined antisemitic double standard. The original intention of UNRWA was to abate the immediate humanitarian situation, then help Palestinians integrate into their new host countries. Palestinian refugees generally refused integration, as did host countries and donors, which is why UNRWA eventually gave up on integrating them. It is correct to call this a political decision rather than a strictly humanitarian one, but the alternative - pressing for integration - would also be a political decision rather than a strictly humanitarian one, so cries of UNRWA's politicization are fairly silly.

Then there is Strabo who mentions them of temporarily holding lands upto the Ganges.

""""how the example of some other maps choosing that route means this article must"""" I fail to see how this part of history is being treated differently from any other. Also you seem to brush aside the mentioned articles about the Roman Empire and Achaemenid Empire as though they are insignificant or of little value to learn from (editing wise). Considering those artciles are of high importance and would attract a lot of interest, it has been edited in such a way that has deemed fit and that wikipedia seems to follow such a policy where a political entity is shown by the greatest extent that it has encompassed geographically. So to stay in league with other high quality articles it would be in the articles best interest to follow suit.

""""lost its capital would not later be able to negotiate a peace treaty along much larger borders, as indicated by the Heliodorus pillar"""" the Heliodorus pillar was erected 60 years after Pataliputra was taken by the Greeks and within the same was taken back by the Sunga Empire.

 Disparity between Traditional Jewish Dates and Academic Dates 

User:PiCo, I will desist from making edits in this current article, since I feel my input might be misconstrued or disruptive, and that, of course, would not be my intent. However, please be apprised that there is a vast disparity between the traditional Jewish method of calibrating years based on a carefully guarded oral tradition, as opposed to modern methods used primarily by Christians who rely heavily upon the modern academic methods applied in dating chronology. The two are still reconcilable, but it will take a vast amount of effort and a person of """"long wind"""" (patience) and extreme diligence to even begin to explain where the discrepancies have """"crept-in"""" to ancient chronologies. The Jews insist that there were only 210 years of slavery in Egypt, although the 430 years mentioned in the Hebrew Bible are merely counted from the time of Isaac's birth, until the departure of Israel from Egypt. You see, """"strangers in a land not theirs,"""" really begins with Abraham's seed in the land of Canaan. Anyway, my view is not to interrupt your work, but to let it proceed on course. I would, however, have preferred to see you mention more about the """"other method"""" practiced by mainstream Judaism, whether it is accepted or not by Christian or academic circles. This would have given more balance to the current article. I have an inkling that someone will eventually start another article dealing only the Jewish tradition of biblical chronology.

If I might say, for us, the Scroll of Antiochus is considered a reliable source.

 CERTAIN FLAWS WITH MODERN SCHOLARSHIP:
 
I wish to point out something about modern scholarship that I think we should be aware of. Research has been carried out in France by a certain Christian Robin and André Lemaire on the subject of the 
Queen of Sheba and King Solomon.
 
André Lemaire wrote: “The hypothesis of a Sheba in Northern Arabia at the beginning of the 1st millennium BCE (Noth 1968: 223-224; Würthwein 1977: 121; Eph‘al 21984: 88-89, 227-229; Garbini 1984; Sarkiö 1994:190; Mulder 1998: 509-510) has no basis and is generally abandoned (Robin 1992: col. 1109-1110, 1118; Avanzini 1996: 13; Kitchen 1997b: 128.”
 
He also writes: “The first mention of Sheba in Neo-Assyrian texts is to be dated mid-8th c. BCE with the story of a caravan of 200 camels coming from Tayma and Sheba to Hindanu (Middle-Euphrates) (Cavigneaux – Ismaïl 1990: 339-357; Frame 1995: 300; Younger 2003: 279-282; Holladay 2006: 319-321).”
 
Contrary to modern scholarship, it should be noted here that, in Jewish tradition, king Solomon did not begin his reign in circa 1,000 BCE, as purported by modern scholarship, but rather in circa 843 BCE, as we find in Jewish tradition. Likewise, in Jewish tradition, the first Temple was destroyed in 422 BCE, rather than in the erroneous date used by scholars of the western world to fix its destruction, i.e. in 586 BCE. Modern scholars totally ignore Jewish tradition and wrongly put historical events at least 200 years earlier, which accounts for the discrepancies in calibrating these important events and not finding historical records to substantiate these events.
 
The one major flaw in their critical view of Jewish texts is the belief that if they cannot find an archaeological document affirming a certain event mentioned in the Bible, for them it is as though the event never happened. This is a fallacy in logic.

To begin to tackle this tremendous difficulty with modern scholarship and Jewish tradition, we must first lay down a premise that will follow us all throughout this discussion, and that is the fact that historical records have been kept by Jews since ancient times, and they have often preserved these very written accounts of events by marking their dates in the Seleucid Era counting. This is vital, as without which information, it will be virtually impossible to determine the sequence of events and to correctly compare them with dates in the Julian / Gregorian calendars. 

The Aramaic """"Scroll of Antiochus,"""" known in Hebrew as """"Megillath Benei Hašmonai"""" (The Scroll of the Sons of Asamoneus), is a curious document, alleged by Rabbi Saadia Gaon in his Introduction to """"Ha-Eggron"""" to have been written by the elders of the schools of Hillel and Shammai in the Chaldaic language, meaning, a document that dates back earlier than the book Seder Olam, composed by Rabbi Yose b. Halpetha in the 2nd century CE. In that book, the """"Scroll of Antiochus,"""" we find this remarkable remark, viz., that """"from the Second Temple's rebuilding till the 23rd year of the reign of Antiochus Eupator, son of Antiochus Epiphanes, who invaded Judaea, there had transpired 213 years in total.""""

Why was the below article redirected to ET? I thought it was setup for a vote and nothing was finalised?

Extra Terrestrial Biological Entity

EBE is an abbreviation for the term Extra Terrestrial Biological Entity.

In the 1940's several alien spacecraft were allegedly recovered by the U.S. and other countries, along with a few dead aliens and one live one. These beings were referred to as EBEs (a name suggested by Dr. Vannevar Bush).

The term was first made reference to in 1986 when Jenny Randles interviewed a military soldier named """"Robert"""" about some stolen Top Secret US Military papers. The term was first made public in 1987 with the release of the Majestic 12 documents by Timothy Good (a)(b):

""""Dr. Detlev Wulf Bronk's team has suggested the term """"Extra Terrestrial Biological Entities"""" (EBEs), be adopted as the standard term of reference for these creatures until such time as a more definitive designation can be agreed upon.""""  (b)

In a letter to researcher William Steinman, Dr. Robert I. Sarbacher who was with the Washington Institute of Technology, confirms that some of the scientists involved in the study of recovered flying discs from Roswell were Dr. Vannever Bush, John von Neumann, and Dr. Robert Oppenheimer. (c) Steinman also discovered that one of the scientists working on saucer technology from the early days was Dr. Eric Henry Wang who became Director of the Department of Special Studies, within the Structures Division, of the old Wright Air Development Center, near Dayton, Ohio. 

This term has been often used in the TV series X-files.

"Unsolicited Advice 

Hi Pigsonthewing,

As someone who has been silently observing your behaviour over the past few months on Wikipedia, I am worried by what I perceive to be a downward spiral of petty fighting, vindictiveness, childishness and bad faith on your part. It seems that you've lost the joy in editing Wikipedia, and now you do as some sort of way of making yourself feel better at the expense of others. What a small, small man you are. Grow up! Get a life! Find yourself a girl to have sex with or something, because the way you've been sliding downhill is bringing everyone else at this fine institution down. I'm here to create an encyclopedia. You seem to be here to fight with other people and cause disruptions. You're making everyone else's life harder. Please stop that; just go away.

Respectfully,

 Camille Paglia: sex-positive feminist 

Here are the supporting links you asked for, you stupid twit!

http://www.lotl.com/content/paglia.htm

http://www.reference.com/browse/wiki/Sex-positive_feminism

If you are too lazy and full of yourself to read them in their entirety then I will just post the relevant sections here:

Camille Paglia: """"On the other hand I’ve been saying in public for five years ago, as someone who’s endorsed prostitutes and strippers and that whole extreme of sex-positive experience, that I’m concerned about the effect on young people – people growing up from 8, 10, 14 in a climate where it’s gone to the opposite direction. I’m already out there concerned about this so I’m really outraged to be stereotyped in that way by her because I am a career teacher and yes, when you have a situation where commercialised sex is being pushed without a true eroticism…I’ve been saying this for years, that we have got to a point of meaningless exhibitionism without real eroticism. I’m for eroticism."""" 

Camille Paglia is a major American social critic. Paglia's academic writing focuses on the role of vibrant dangerous sexuality in human history. Paglia's key importance to sex-positive feminism is not only her writings on sex, but her advocacy of """"traditional"""" values like canon texts. Paglia is somewhat of an intellectual enigma, a conservative and academic feminist, who revels in low and high culture alike and celebrates sexualities disapproved of by mainstream Western culture. Paglia has, in many ways, presented a """"respectable"""" face for pro-sex feminism to the world at large.""",0.14285714285714285

"Thanks for getting back to me. Like on many pages, a consensus will never form, unless people who have a fairly objective take on affairs decide to leave the page to the POV pushers. This page, like many pages of strong national interest to certain users, will forever be a battleground. I'm sure you've seen it elsewhere as well  there is a cadre of users who post on one topic only, and large numbers of them congregate around a topic of interest. They post a certain perspective on the topic, and basically exert ownership over the topic. People who come in and see what might be considered to be bias, and try to change the page, are quickly overwhelmed. Even when they are not, and achieve some sort of compromise after a long struggle, sooner or later a new account will arrive and undo the consensus.  This is exactly what happened here. (Of course, it's even worse when two interest groups who are hostile to each other try to gain control of a topic of interest  then it's world war III!  I'm sure you've seen that too.)

This is what has happened on this page and others relating to pre-Islamic Iran, a topic of considerable passion to many Iranian emigres in particular.  Many of the users who post regularly on these topics post about Iranian topics, and Iranian topics only.  It is an uphill battle to get some of the evident POV bias removed, and when it is, surely enough, along comes a new account do undo the cease fire.  The unfortunate thing is just how easy it is for wikipedia pages to be owned in this way, the result being that the page reads like propaganda.",0.0

Etiquette
Your statement """"I keep my conviction that I'm on the truth: that you two are members of some racist organization"""" on this edit directed toward User:Dark Tichondrias  is an accusation that two users are racists, making it against Wikipedia's policy on etiquette.  Wikipedia's policy on etiquette suggests to not accuse other users of being racist. 
WP:Wikiettiquete says:
Terms like """"racist,"""" """"sexist"""" or even """"poorly written"""" make people defensive. This makes it hard to discuss articles productively. If you have to criticize, you must do it in a polite and constructive manner.
This seems to be the issue of dispute. Yet racism is at the heart of this discussion, specially because DT and Thulean are percieved by all the rest as people with such an agenda. 
I'm pondering to start a project called WP:Honesty: Say things clear (without falling in insults), don't hide in word games, don't make threats that make no sense (bravados), don't edit capriciously ignoring the discussion, etc. Play fair and demand others to do the same. 
You pretend that I'm making ad hominem attacks, yet I'm just pointing out who's misbehaving and why. Something that is obvious to all, including you two.
If you would be even minimally sincere you would not be trying to corner me against arbitrarily selected Wikipolicies but you would have protested your innocence, first of all. You are just playing legalism.
If you want me to refrain from denouncing your behaviour and your agenda the least your could do is to  is to protest your innocence, to explain your reasons, to pretend at least that you are not racist. But you only make attacks ad hominem against my honesty and sincerity.
Keep it that way. I don't mind.  

Personal Attacks

Please refrain from personal attacks which you made in Talk:White_people. Or next time you will be reported to WP:DP.  
I am not making any personal attacks. I honestly think you are a nazi (or close equivalent, if you want to dwell in the small letter and word twists). You haven't even bothered in denying it, so why should I think otherwise. 
If you think that stating that is a personal attack, please say why. I don't think that openly declaring the (apparent) truth is any personal attack but just that: stating facts, so we can discuss honestly.
What is being discussed in that article's talk page is largely ideological and some people of certain ideology (you and DarkTichondrias) are trying to manipulate the participative process of Wikipedia in your favor, editing ignoring the consensus. I honestly believe it is my duty to fight such behaviour and defend the neutrality of Wikipedia. And I will do it.  
If you still arent satisfied, you can ask a request for investigation, but I must warn it can well backfire.  

Of course I wont dignify your silly personal attacks with a response. And you repeated your personal attack with your response. I'll be reporting you.  
Excellent.  

Calling another editor a nazi, regardless of whether you think it is true, is completely unacceptable.  If you continue, you may be blocked for personal attacks.  Please find a more civil way to discuss your concerns about the article.  babelfish

Let me clarify my position... while it may be a debatable point whether an Amazon review or a blog thread is a """"reliable source"""" to use at Wikipedia (I personally think it is given a supporting piece of evidence, e.g. CALLING THE PERSON HERSELF OR THE OWNER OF THE BLOG PERSONALLY), you are completely, 100% wrong if you think she is actually NOT a dissident or that the review and blog postings attributed to her are not 100% hers:

Um, Tara can you double check with PZ that that post was actually from her? Look at the wording/syntax thats not how scientists write. That looks like lincoln with gel in his hair.

PZ's not raised any red flags, and the second quote was from the live chat. The visit was to promote this new venture of hers. Unfortunately, I have no doubt it's her.

That sigh was because I thought highly of Margulis; she has done some excellent work, and is always a source for original ideas. Unfortunately, the HIV denialist comments were all ignorant crap that only a deluded fool would find convincing. So that was a sigh of disappointment.

Posted by: PZ Myers | March 15, 2007 09:16 AM

Furthermore, I know form personal communication with Harvey Bialy that Lynn Margulis did communicate to him personally her positive review of the book. So, while the question of what's a """"reliable source"""" may be some issue, I just want you to know if happen to have any doubts, that you ARE 100% completely factually wrong if you claim (a) her statements and viewpoints attributed to her are not hers, and (b) she is not a dissident.

 Orlando """"Jonathan Blanchard"""" Bloom 

I anyone tries to add this back, here's the story. Back in 2005 or so, my roomate (Jonathan Blanchard, or as we call him Jo) had pretty long hair and his then girlfriend called him Jorlando Bloom, as a general funny/derogatory insult. It pissed him off and we started to call him that for a while. Apparently one of us got on Wikipedia and vandalised the page . About two days ago, he found out, and thought I recently vandalized the page, but we checked the history and it turned out to date from March 2005. That's nearly 4 years ago! Then  added a reference for this , probably in good faith, but for the various biographical details (date of birth, etc...). 

So now you have a ton of mirrors and sources that based themselves on this Wikipedia article, saying that Orlando Bloom's full name is Orlando Jonathan Blanchard Bloom. Hell, even the disambiguation page was affected , again probably in good faith (and then reverted a few days ago, by my roomate ).

This is ridiculous. I'm here trying to create a better encyclopedia and this is the support I get? Hell of a turn off.  
While there are about 1000 administrators on wikipedia, only 14 of them have checkuser permission and 99% of the cases here are answered by just two of them, so you may have to be patient.  No article is so important that the sky will fall if it is stuck in the """"wrong version"""" for a few more days.  You can try a request for comment on the article to get some outside opinions if the usual editors can't agree.  
Sounds like this system is broken. Only 2 of the 14 people actually do the work? Time to replace some people. Or put some kind of disclaimer that this isn't very timely. Something to let people know not to expect results.  

 I'll be damned if I'm going to put up with that kind of abuse.  (talk)

I'm just coming into this, but that seems more than a little harsh. Can't wikipedia have operational disagreements without assuming it's personal attacks, resulting in blocks? Or is there something outside this discussion I'm not seeing? -T-C 

I think the cascade of abusive comments directed at the checkusers were more than enough justification for blocking for disruption; common sense says you don't come ask for help and then start taking swings at the people you're asking for help. By the way, just for future note by anyone watching, the reason that it takes a while to get a response is because we have to deal with things like this; if people were, you know, patient/pleasant/appreciative, then we might be a bit more inclined to run checks. As it stands, we gain very little but constant abuse from all sides for volunteering our time to do this.  (Talk)

Guys like Jerry Briscoe and Barry Windham are retired, so there is no chance of them winning it.

We need to set the limit for potential champions for those who are currently in the promotion, be it either WWE or TNA.

It just keeps things less cluttered.

 New review articles on human population genetics based on studies of ancient DNA 

Wikipedia has a lot of interesting articles based on the ongoing research in human molecular genetics that helps trace the lineage of people living in various places on the earth. I've been reading university textbooks on human genetics """"for fun"""" since the 1980s, and for even longer I've been visiting my state flagship university's vast BioMedical Library to look up topics on human medicine and health care policy. On the hypothesis that better sources build better articles as all of us here collaborate  to build an encyclopedia, I thought I would suggest some sources for improving articles on human genetic history and related articles. The  Wikipedia guidelines on reliable sources in medicine provide a helpful framework for evaluating sources. 

The guidelines on reliable sources for medicine remind editors that """"it is vital that the biomedical information in all types of articles be based on reliable, third-party, published sources and accurately reflect current medical knowledge."""" 

The guidelines, consistent with the  general Wikipedia guidelines on reliable sources, remind us that all """"Wikipedia articles should be based on reliable, published secondary sources"""" (emphasis in original). They helpfully define a primary source in medicine as one in which the authors directly participated in the research or documented their personal experiences. By contrast, a secondary source summarizes one or more primary or secondary sources, usually to provide an overview of the current understanding of a medical topic. The general Wikipedia guidelines let us know that """"Articles should rely on secondary sources whenever possible. For example, a review article, monograph, or textbook is better than a primary research paper. When relying on primary sources, extreme caution is advised: Wikipedians should never interpret the content of primary sources for themselves."""" 

Two review articles in prominent journals about human population genetics are bringing together analysis of the many recent studies of human DNA, including DNA from ancient individuals. 

Earlier studies of this issue were based on more limited samples (fewer genes, and fewer human individuals from fewer regions and only recent times). As more samples of more genes from more individuals from more places and times are gathered, the molecular evidence is making it increasingly clear that human beings have been moving back and forth across the Earth's surface and mixing genes over long distances ever since their earliest ancestors moved out of the human homeland in Africa.

"I am glad you are working on a rewrite and I will be glad to help out. There are 2 problems I see with what you are doing so far. One is that you really can't tell this story without a little historical context and in particular you can't leave out Morgan and the fruit fly work (and the change in the perception of what mutation was and how it affected the genetic variability of the populstion from the ideas of the earlier Mendalians such as De Vries). So at some point something about it has to go back in. The other is that most modern historians of science (Larson, Bowler, Gould) treat the foundation of population genetics as the start (Gould calls it the first phase) of the modern synthesis, not part of the run up to it. I realize this view differs somewhat from the view of Mayr who emphasizes more the later parts of the synthesis that involved the integration of other fields of biology with population genetics as the actual synthesis, but on this point I think, the article needs to follow the views of most current historians of science rather than those of Mayr or the other participants. There is a reason why historians do not rely exclusively on first person accounts of the participants in an event, and the biggest has to do with perspective.

"""Kurt and Dave get it on?==

Groaning Kurt released his cock. For the past week he hadn't been able to get off. He tried a cocktail of drugs and a cocktail of whores. Nothing was doing it for him. Masturbating in the shower wasn't even working. Oh he was getting hard all right, he just couldn't fucking cum. And it was driving him nuts.

To top it off, he didn't know why he couldn't cum. The girls had been either hot enough or slutty enough. Even the couple of guys he brought home had been decent. Despite that, he couldn't fucking cum. And a week of that was enough to make anyone more pissy than normal.

Which meant band practice was unlikely to be much fun for anyone.

That was made abundantly clear the moment Kurt stepped into the rehearsal studio. His eyes flicked from Krist to Dave and he came to a sudden stop. Dave was sitting on a couch, a pretty girl in his lap giggling. It was like he was taunting Kurt. And he would have nothing of that.

Stalking over to the drummer and the floozie, Kurt pulled her forcibly out of his lap. The girl squealed and Dave growled, but Kurt paid no attention, forcing the girl out of the studio. After slamming the door he headed back over to Dave. Without a word he pulled the drummer to him and kissed him possessively.

Dave shoved Kurt away, """"What part of no don't you fucking understand!?""""

Krist's eyes widened and he took a step forward, """"Guys, I think—""""

Kurt sent him a silent glare, silencing and stopping him.

""""I don't want you, Kurt. I don't even fucking like you right now,"""" Dave growled. """"In fact, I fucking quit! I don't have to put up with this shit. You're fucking insane. You need some other crackwhore to take my place. I'm not it.""""

Sidestepping the singer, Dave headed towards the door. He barely made three steps before Kurt grabbed him again. This time his back was pulled to Kurt's front. He could clearly feel the singer's erection pressing into his ass.

He wasn't going to be anyone's bitch.

""""I'm just gonna... go,"""" Krist muttered before slipping out of the room quickly.

""""You're fucking mine, Dave,"""" Kurt declared, licking Dave's neck. """"Always.""""

For as small as he was, Kurt had more strength than Dave expected. With considerably less effort than he would have figured, the singer forced the drummer down to the floor. Dave wiggled and tried to crawl away, but all that resulted was in Kurt pulling the drummer's pants off.

Laying down on top of Dave while he worked his own pants off, Kurt hissed in his ear, """"You're mine. You hear me? Fucking mine.""""

""""Stop! Kurt, stop!"""" Dave struggled.

With Kurt's weight on him, the drummer had very little maneuverability. He was completely trapped. But that didn't mean he stopped trying to get away. While wholly his struggling was probably a good thing, it wasn't really helping. If anything it was turning Kurt on more.

Not having the patience to remove Dave's boxers, Kurt reached down and tore the back seam, exposing the drummer's ass. He didn't even pause to warn Dave. His hands spread Dave's cheeks, spit down his crack to provide some lubrication, and quickly pushed his cock in. Dave screamed, wiggling once more to get away. With Kurt's hands holding onto his hips, he had no chance to go anywhere, at least not until the singer was done.

Dave's screams faded into sobs. That alone drove Kurt further, faster. He loved everything about it. The way Dave's ass squeezed his cock better than anyone else's had before. He was a perfect glove, a perfect fit. Before too long a week's worth of unreleased cum spurted from Kurt's cock.

Slowly he pulled out, not really caring about the mixture of blood and semen leaking from Dave's ass. Grinning to himself he refastened his pants. He glanced at Dave, a feeling of superiority infusing him. He totally owned Dave now. 

Does anyone have any basis for this rumour? I would love to put it on the main page.

Right. Well, here's what I've done just now. 

Changed section heading """"modern philosophy"""" to """"philosophical topics"""", to move the article more in line with Lac's proposal. The text there still reads in a historical sort of way, but that shouldn't distract the presentation of the broader themes and ideas presented. A single paragraph in the philosophical topics section was transferred a section up into the historical section, under the subheading """"modern western philosophy"""".
A bit of text in the rationalism-empiricism subsection misleadingly implied that Locke was a """"naturalist"""", and Hume the first empiricist. This is obviously wrong, so I changed it.

Something problematic: the sentence """"During this era, religious philosophy did not play a large role in the struggles that occupied secular philosophy"""" is either misleading (assuming """"secular philosophy"""" to mean """"not on the face of it pertaining to issues of God, etc"""") or trivially true (assuming the same to mean """"completely non-religious philosophy""""). Assuming the former, and assuming we take """"this era"""" to mean """"the Modern era"""", it counts as a counter-example that Descartes was completely religious; that God was his one of his clear and distinct solutions to the dilemmas in the Meditations. Locke's generally secular outlook on politics had great stake in religion: the man thought atheists were not to be trusted, and was at pains to advocate religious toleration on grounds that did not have to admit the fallibility of religion. The more stark example of Berkeley, already mentioned in the text, is an understatement: it is not just his disputes with Newton, but rather, absolutely anything that Berkeley said, which could not be divorced from his religious views (including his theory of vision). Malebranche is another example. It's my impression that there wasn't a genuine """"cooling off"""" from appeals to religion until the late modern period. So I recommend the sentence be scrapped.

This way, we preserve the information about who worked together and who worked separately.  Since the information is in a table and not in the middle of a sentence, I see no reason to correct grammar here (and I'm usually really picky about grammar).  The best example that comes to mind is Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl where the credits list writers as Ted Elliott & Terry Rossio and Stuart Beattie and Jay Wolpert.  Clearly, the first two worked together, while the last two worked independently of the others.  I think that information is important and (if it were an episode of a TV series) should be listed as such in the episode table.  Whenever I type in writers, I always go with whatever the episode says (of course, from what I can remember, I've never dealt with an episode from more than two writers before).  Again, though, there is no statement anywhere in policy that I can find that specifies which format should be used.",0.0

 My Two Cents 

 Political correctness will be the end of our world as we know it. This is sad that political correctness has come to this level. It is causing our society to reward failure and condone criminal behavior. This is sad. We might as well change the constitution and exclude freedom of speech. This is next. Truly sad. Truly sad, indeed. 

 Also, regardless what you want to refer to the chinese as, china is the reason why the US's economy is in the crapper, and why our unemployment rate is higher than it has been since the early 1980's. We have made """"those people"""" rich while our economic infrastructure is crumbling. Open your eyes!

And for those reasons, I despise China as well as the politically correct.

 Niggardly 
It is apparent by reading wiki's page on the """"controversial"""" word """"niggardly"""", that stupid people and words do not mix. It has been said that most people never pick up a book after leaving high school. Proof of this exists in the fact that this word can be taken so blatantly out of definition, that persons are asking that it be banned from the English language. As I said, idiots and words can be a dangerous combination.

What is even sadder is that I expressed this comment on wiki's niggardly page, and was accused of vandalism, yet others posted similar comments.

"""::Addendum: I think I may have found the source of the confusion.  Within the medical establishment, a medical student who has not yet received his or her MD is referred to as an """"undergraduate"""", in contrast with residents who've received their MDs but are not yet board-certified.  In that context, a medical student is an """"undergraduate"""" because he or she has not graduated from the MD program.  However, that does not mean that an MD is an """"undergraduate degree"""" as that term is usually understood in the US.  That term is reserved for bachelor degrees; any program (such as medical school or law school) which is generally attained after four-year college is called a """"graduate program"""", and the degrees it grants are """"graduate degrees"""".

I think that the current wording is adequate to avoid this confusion.

Reports from CNN that 46 people were killed on Monday. As we discuss this, the Syrian Armed forces (Army, Republican Guard, etc.) are trading hot rounds of lead with the Free Syrian Army. Also, a neighborhood was shelled and snipers continue hunt activists like they're animals. I read from Yahoo News that 9 soldiers from the Syrian Army (pro-Assad) were killed and many more wounded, the same day 46 others (anti-Assad) were killed. Therefore it's clear there has become a constant exchange in gunfire and violence overall. I think you can either call this a Civil War or perhaps a Revolution, but it's quite clear (to me at least) that the uprising is over and Syria is now a war zone. After months of violence that ranged from smaller domestic disurbances to riots with people being killed, the United States decides to close their embassy and get all of their diplomats out of the country.

"The origins are very obscure. The Bedouin Arabs, who were the original followers of Mohammed and responsible for the first islamic conquests in Syria, Palestine, and Persia, were a nomadic people who lived in tents. In the cities they conquered they began by converting old buildings, and christian churches became mosques; in damascus a pagan temple transformed into a Christian church was incorporated into the Great Mosque (706-15). The earliest and one of the most beautiful of islamic buildings is the Dome of the Rock, Jerusalem, built as a sanctuary (not as a mosque)[there's some debate about this] on a circular plan (685-705, but much altered later, especially in 1561 when the exterior was cased in Persian tiles and the interior lined with marble). The first minarets were converted church towers in Syria, and that built a Kairouan, Tunisia (724-7), is modelled on such a tower. True to their nomadic origins the Umayyad rulers preferred desert residences to town palaces. Several survive in ruins - Qasr al-Hair (728-9); Mshatta near Amman, Jodania; and Qasr at-Tuba in the Wadi Ghadorf near Amman. In plan these groups of buildings were derived from Roman frontier stations. Both religious and secular buildings of the period incorporate elements which were to become distinguishing features of islamic architecture: The horseshoe arch, tunnel vaults of stone and brick, rich surface decoration in carved stone, mosaic, and painting. During the Umayyad period the mosque took its permanent architectural for, dictated by liturgical needs - minarets from which the faithful could be called to prayer; a wide courtyard with a central fountain for ablutions, with surrounding colonnades to give protection from the sun; a large praying chamber, marked externally by a dome (as a sign of importance) and internally by the mihrab or niche indicating the direction of Mecca, towards which the faithful must turn in prayer. The last survivor of the Umayyad dynasty became the founder of the Emirates at Cordoba in Spain, where the early style of Islamic architecture was brought to perfection in the Great Mosque (786-990)
Under the Abassids who surplanted the Umayyads in 750, Persian influence began to dominate the Islamic world. The main achievements in architecture were the foundation of the new capital at Baghdad, built on a circular plan (762-7, now largely destroyed) and, slightly later, the smaller city of Raqqa, Syria of which little survives except its richly decorated gateways. It was at this period that Islamic architecture began to depart radically from Hellenistic and Byzantine conventions. An elaborate court etiquette, derived from persia and contrary to Bedouin ideas of informality, was introduced, and palaces were designed for the new caliphs on more formal and grandiose lines, e.g. the palaces of Ukhaidir and Samarra in Iraq. These large buildings were run up very quickly; stone was abandoned in favour of brick and there was much use of decorative stucco. The main C9 achievements were the great mosque of Kairouan, Tunisia (836); the mosque of Bu Fatata, Susa, Tunisia (850-1); the Great Mosque of Samarra, Iraq with its strange ziggurat-like minaret (c850) and the very well preserved mosque of Inb Tulun, Cairo (876-7). Buidling materials were usually rough but dressed with intricate geometrical or floral surface decorations in painted stucco, mosaic, glazed tiles, or shallow relief carving. Local traditions influenced the decorative styles in various regions (See Indian pakistan, persian and turkish architecture)
''In the original nucleus of the Islamic world the most notable later mosques are those a Tabriz, Persia (1204), Cairo (Mosque of Sultan Barquq 1384) and Isfahan Persia (1585). Most of the earlier religious builings, including the Masjid-el-aksa and the dome of the rock in jerusalem, were also altered and more richly decorated in these centuries. In southern spain a local style of great oppulence was developed; it's principle monuments are the Giralda tower, Seville (1159) and the Alhambra (1309-54)",0.0

You can have $150 worth of free merchandise-anything in the store, doesn't have to be dildos-if you print off this message and bring it to any of our stores within the next ninety days. We are doing our part to reach out to you and put the past unpleasantness behind us. Whether you accept our offer is up to you.",0.0

Dick I feel for you.  The peer commentaries and other IMO arguably relevant SPS's are inadmissible here on wikipedia for any number of reasons.

If any of the people who wrote commentaries you could include their reaction to TMWWBQ and Dreger's paper as written in the commentaries there.  As their own BLP what they write about themselves is admissiable.  However as far as trying to get such sources admitted in general no dice.  We went through TWO RSN's on this.  It can be considered a general WP consensus that such sources are only admissiable if they come from people who were invited expert commentators, people with relevant academic backgrounds.

Hiya. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against the article itself - for a description of a band night, it's fairly well written.

I dispute most of this statement.

""""Controversy exists about the branding of Arborsculpture as none of the practitioners he presents in his book (""""Arborsculpture Solutions for a small planet"""") use the methods as described in the books, accept the term, or agree to be tagged by it.""""

This wiki page is not about the book Arborsculpture or the about author. The statement is a lie as several of the subjects in the book do use the word. Herman Block who was in the book uses the chair making techniques as described in the book. If someone resurrects a lie that was edited out long ago it's the same as writing the lie themselves. 
But I'll accept this: 
""""Controversy exists about the naming or branding of the art form as Arborsculpture""""

 This page should not be used as a way to slap down the competition when someone has a new book coming out on the same subject.
Blackash is pooktre and has a conflict of interest, a new book coming out and needs to sign with 4 tildes so we can track what they do on wikipedia.  There were some good historical photos on the page but these have been replaced with error notices, this is very close to vandalism. The methods described on the page are general enough and do reflect the methods used to create the trees in the historical photos shown. The historical photos should be returned. 

I don't think Portmanteau is accurate, """"conjunction"""" is better.

I think the following should be removed.
 """"Richard Reames was inspired by the works of Axel Erlandson to attempt his first experiments with growing trees in chairs, which lead him to writing his first book """"How to grow a chair"""" before his experiments were mature.""""
While this is true, this Wiki page is about the word Arborsculpture, it is not about Richard Reames or his books.

 POV statement which couldn't be salvaged

Reasons I think it's POV:
""""arbitrarily"""" - Please elaborate, and explain how this is relevant to the article
""""warmongering"""" - I think this term is rarely appropriate in an encyclopedia, and certainly not here.  There are many other better words.
The 10,000 figure isn't even mentioned in the article itself.  So, if it's not important or noteworthy enough to put there, why does it belong in a broad article about the country?
The 10,000 figure appears to come from his recollection.  Since when do we rely one person, an activist at that, to be the sole source for a casualty estimate?
The U.S.'s involvement is more of a side note here, and does not really fit in with the rest of the description of Angola's history.  In another article about, I don't know, CIA activities in Angola, maybe, but not here.

 are you a troll? 

You call me a troll.
Let's review the facts:
All ancient sources (I AM a historian) mention about 30,000 Dacian warriers in the first war (the so called """"Scond Battle of Tapae""""😉, which was not at all a battle of Tapae, but the battle for Sarmizegetusa, a few miles only further, never conquered by the romans, which fled scared shitless to Adamclisi, 700km further east, where the battle for the Dacian capital Sarmizegetusa also ended! With a shrine inscripted with more than 3,000 fallen roman soldiers, only the limited wall surface of the shrine limiting the names inscriptions.., this also being called by you """"a decissive roman victory""""😉 for Sarmizegetusa, not conqered at that time by the romans, which started towards it but were stopped at Tapae, and when the Dacians stopped fighting because of the legendary """"strange storm"""", """"anger of the Dacian Gods"""", and they were defenceless, the romans, also a few miles only from Sarmizgetusa and open for taking, ran as crazy 700km in 4 days, to their reserve troops at Adamclisi.. and you call this """"decisive roman victory""""😉), and 15,000 Dacian soldiers in the second big war, of AD 105, ending in 106AD.
This correct troops amount stayed a few decades (anyway many years; I made screenshots at some point for a school documentary), and only recently somebody vandalised the site changing the amount in a couple of hundred thousands, with NO SOURCE REFERENCES what so ever, and he couldn't do it too as all historical info points out the tiny Dacian army at that time.
YOU, as administrator, in sted of correcting the vandalism and restore the page, didn't give a damn..
When I came and restored the info, doing YOUR JOB, you acuse me of """"vandalism""""😉, and that """"I am partial to the Dacians"""", while you are the one partial to the romans and to vandalism.
Further more, you acuse me that """"being partial to the Dacians""""😉, I said that the Dacians won, not the romans, adding that """"I did not attach sources ref./proof""""😉.

On the page of the First Battle of Tapae, was allways mentioned (with source ref. attached; poorly and only 1 source while there are many.. but OK) that the governer (of the invading roman army in the DACIAN Moesia) was killed together with his army (that is correct). 
This first battle of Tapae (again BS; it was the battle of the romams for Sarmizegetusa, also stopped at Tapae, Sarmizwgetusa was NOT conquered, that's why was called The battle of """"Tapae"""" which was nothing, just an emlty field, and the roman empire does NOT fight to conquer grass and empty fields) was also lost by the roman army which was totally defeated/anhilated, and even Fuscus died in battle. All these info are correct and o  your/that page. Accepted by you as administrator.
You call this """"a roman victory""""😉.
If i call it as it is,  a Dacian victory, you call me a troll and tell me that """"that didn't happened"""", meaning Dacian victory.
Than WHAT do you call it? 
It's a retorical question.
I am a pretty known international history investigator, and my coleagues often make fun of the wikipedia trolls which poses as administrators. I mean.. the facts speak for themselfs. You change Dacian victories in """"indecisive battle"""", and indecisive battles in """"roman victory"""", which makes you automaticaly bias, and history falsifier, obviously in favour of the invading hoodlam romans. 
You go so far in presenting the invading (into Dacian teritories) romans as """"the good guys"""" and the Dacians as """"bad guys"""", that you even post totally ridiculous texts like """"the Dacians invaded Dacia, and the romans (coming beligerantly all the way from Italy) were right to punishe the Dacians for that""""😉.
How criminal are you?
About you history knowlwdge (if any) is pointless to ask. Right?
All the so called (also BS because the Dacians never started nor wanted war) """"Dacian Wars"""", which were actually Roman wars, started by the invading roman army, and all took place OUTSIDE Italy, into Dacian/Thracian teritories. Roman wars, and you call them """"Dacian wars"""", to manipulate the readers on subliminal levels.

Moesia, which was also Dacian teritory (by the way, you can find this info also on wikipedia if you have no official sources), invaded, masacred and robbed by the roman army coming from Italy, when saved from the romans by the Dacians (as it was part of Dacia), is called by you on your page """"murdering dacians""""😉, """"the dacians swarmed into Moesia to rob and pilleage""""😉.. and other bullshit.
So the dacians were the robbers or the romans??
And WHAT did the Dacians had to rob from their own dacian teritory?? Didn't they have more GOLD than they knew what to do with it, gold stolen by the ROBBER Trajan in AD 106 from Dacia in such huge quantities that the roman empire florished as never before?

more on consensus
The following (about consensus) followed slrubinsteins Wikipolicy essay
I pretty much agree with all that, but it seems incomplete.  There are other important policies and guidelines.  For example, there's WP:Consensus, and WP:Summary style, and WP:Undue weight to name a few.  Just because some inserted material satisfies WP:NPOV, WP:V, WP:RS, and WP:NOR does not mean that an editor can insist (repeatedly) on inserting it into an article.  And whether the material satisfies those policies should be determined not just by an individual editor but by consensus.  

Ferrylodge, I certainly accept that other policies may apply.  And I know you are acting in good faith with good intentions.  But with all due respect, I think your message muddies the waters.  First of all, """"undue weight"""" is a subsection of NPOV.  By my linking NPOV, I simultaneously included undue weight.  The difference is, I made it clear that NPOV is the umbrella policy and """"undue weight"""" is just a component of that policy and has to be interpreted in the context of the policy as a whole.  You took it out of context which could mislead some people.  Also, """"Summary style"""" is not a policy.  I was talking primarily about policies.  Summary style is a guideline and it may be useful to editors but it does not have the force of a policy.  Finally, I agree with you about consensus, but the consensus policy addresses a different issue than I was raising.  My point was about what can go into articles.  Consensus says nothing about what can or cannot go into articles.  The consensus policy is about interpersonal behavior and process.  The consensus policy is not about content; NPOV, V, and NOR are about content.  It is NPOV, V, and NOR that determine what is acceptable and unacceptable content.  The consensus policy lays out a process for resolving conflicts over content.  But it does not establish principles for resolving the conflict.  The principles remain NPOV, V and NOR.  When editors get into a conflict, we should consult WP:CONSENSUS for ideas about how we can better work together.  But before consensus-based editing, the first step to working together is agreeing to abide by the content policies, NPOV, NOR, and V.    |  Talk 

I agree that """"whether the material satisfies those policies should be determined not just by an individual editor but by consensus,"""" but consensus does not mean unanimity (according to the policy), it is a process of collaboration.  And to participate in this process everyone has to agree that """"if content is a notable significant and verifiable view from a reliable source it will go in even if I do not like it,"""" if they cannot say this, and mean it, they are not participating in a consensus process.  And some people above have argued that content should not go in even if it is notable, verifiable, and from a reliable source.  Those people are not participating in a consensus-building process.    |  Talk 19:51, 6""",0.0

"So you find that a right-wing and left wing unreliable source agree and assume they must both be correct.  There has been considerable study of Marx and there is no reason that we need to use popular books as sources.  The only reason one would use them is that they contain claims that have not been accepted by mainstream historians.  Also, they lead us into discussions about what really happened which is a misuse of other editors' time.  We have an unsubstantiated claim by Jenny Marx made years after the event that her husband provided money for workers to buy weapons.  We do not by the way have any reliable sources that these workers obtained or used weapons in Belgium in 1848.  Reliable sources state that the French government supplied unemployed Belgian workers with weapons in Paris and these workers then returned to Belgium in an attempt to overthrow the government.  We know that Marx was arrested on suspicion of carrying arms and was ejected from the country, but in fact the accusation was false.  The types of additional sources that Martintg has provided are unreliable.  Boris Nicolaevsky for example was a communist activist (writing in 1933), not a mainstream historian.

"It looks as if this is a goer.
Deutsch/English/Denglish-mir ist egal! Not an issue- just trying to be compatible- just seems sensible to stick to the name prefix system, and its only abbreviations most of which are the same.
The path- There are two types of path (UK) footpaths for walkers and bridleways for walkers, horses and other riders- to a walker the change from footpath to bp is an important consideration- to a horseman it is the difference between allowed and not allowed. I suspect mountain bikers have a similar opinion- do we need to show both- how does this internationalise. I was thinking dark green/ light green but couldn't decide which way round- though if the distinction is not important it should default to dark as this looks clearer. (I'm thinking of printouts too.)
For gradient there seems to be several ways to proceed. As I have said, I was thinking of chevrons like the lock symbol.A double for 1:3 and a single for 1:5 (but this could be adapted meaning very steep and steep- which would vary in context). The German Bahn site has a section for Mountain lines where a spot height is given in a column to the right of the track. This seems simple, effective and could be used on footpaths. 
The colour of green needs to be stated in #rrggbb before anything else is done- reds and blues can be taken from canals and railways.
Glancing at the color-neutral link- is it more difficult for the author writing the router or just the icon maker? Can it be done in Inkscape?

~~From VfD debate on fractional electrodynamics, I wrote:

Delete with prejudice. Mr. Baas, having presented us with fractional probability, fractional paradigm, and fractional calculus already, now attempts to hose us once more. Denni 00:01, 2004 Apr 8 (UTC)

Delete with prejudice""""
(Baas)Ya, you're not supposed to let anyone know that you're prejudice or bias.  Then people disregard what you have to say because it's unsubstantiated, by definition. (definition of prejudice)

Also, may I remind you that character attacks are against wikipedia policy.

Also, in a formal debate, character attacks are considered bad form.  And prejudice certainly isn't considered an argument. In fact, it often causes one to believe and say things that are not true, as Wile has pointed out.  16:09, 8 Apr 2004 (UTC)

(Me)Evidently, English is not your mother tongue, so I can forgive you in misunderstanding that """"Delete with prejudice"""" does not refer to you, but to the article. I have spent some time observing your efforts to create articles which lack the barest semblance of connection to current mathematical research, and to be extremely rude to other Wikipedians when they quite reasonably ask for reliable references and sources. What I know of your work tells me that, even if there is some sense to what you posit, it lacks any context with which to connect to contemporary mathematical thought. It therefore constitutes, at best original research, which is explicitly unacceptable here, and at worst, what I will call delusional thought. It therefore has, in my opinion, no place in Wikipedia at this time, if ever. As I said earlier, call us after the Nobel is awarded.

I would request that any further discussion you may wish to carry on be done on the appropriate talk page. I do not welcone you on my own talk page. Denni 04:39, 2004 Apr 9 (UTC)

""""Delete with prejudice"""" response
(Baas)This is not your territory.  This is the terrority of all who have a voice.

You contradicted yourself when you said that your prejudice was not with me but with the page, and then went on to explain how your prejudice was with me.

Then you insulted me.  Insults are not conducive to meaningfull discussion, nor do I in any way appreciate them.

Your failure to see connections is no evidence of intellectual omniscence.  This would be, in fact, an oxymoron.  Your arguments are overly presumptuous. Consequently, I feel no need to rebuttle. 

Furthermore, your attitude is unrespectably hostile.  09:31, 9 Apr 2004 (UTC)

(Me)As you seem unable to separate your ideas from your identity, it may have seemed like I was criticizing your identity, or """"self"""", as we say in the business. Try as I might, I found nothing in my comments which discussed you negatively as an individual, even to an innocuous level such as not brushing your teeth (and I'm sure you do.) Throckmorton and Hilfiger, though, in a paper published by me in 1997, say that """"idea"""" and """"self"""" are related through fractional intellidynamical impulses which emanate first from the self to the idea, and then back to the self, thus creating a a semantological unificationality of dogmatic theses. In other words, ƒ (i,s) ‡ (Ω +> bbb>ddd) Sorry, I had to invent my own symbols to show the universal relevance of this code, and the government is still on my case about all those phonecalls to the Minister of Foreign Affairs.

 O'Brien, Argentina 

Hi. I have rescued your article, which was in danger of being deleted as a hoax. The first bit was fine, and could be backed up by sources, which I have added: but it was a mistake to put in the facetious bits about pork scratchings and his """"frustratingly sober mind"""", because (a) that jokey tone isn't right for a serious encyclopedia, and (b) you made them up (in WP terms, that's original research) and not verifiable.

This is really getting ridiculous. Because since Nomoskedasticity """"won't be inundated by Keravelt for a few days """" he resorts to propogating  his own NON-NEUTRAL views in the article:
a. He completely ignores the fact that there are views that specifically contest him being CEO (his attorney and the governement). b. He flagrantly misinterprets the Gazette article as reporting Sholom Rubashkin to be the COO (where else did he come up with that idea), while the article clearly reports the US attorneys admitting that they misreported him as CEO (you have not quoted anything to suggest that what I had proven was original research (this all while Mosmof is """"guessing this is the sort of minutiae that the defense lawyers ... so I could live with his title listed as CEO"""" - Original Research?)) c. He then blankly changes the third paragraph's repeated references to Sholom Rubashkin from Vice President to CEO (CEO is contested while Vice President isn't).  d. He changes my clarification of Sholom Rubashkin's exit (that it is disputed by a seocndary source) to simply """"Sholom Rubashkin left his post in September 2008"""" e. He fails to even explain himself in all this.

Is Wikipedia starting the new favored way! I find that's what happens to words. In the 1970's the Egyptian god Re was spelled in British manner where Re is pronounced as Ray and it refers to the sun on days where there are rays of light to cast measured shadows. So the americans changed it to Ra and no one says Ray, they all say Rah. Do this for 4000 years and its a wonder anything is truth and how we ever put up satellites to talk on cell phones so we can all misunderstand each other even in one same language. Can hearts of men reform. Please prove my doubts they will. I think truth is stifled and smothered.

The topic of mutual intelligibility in Slavic languages is a bit difficult. For example, Bulgarian is routinely regarded as a language most distant from the Slavic type and very difficult to understand for most Slavs. In Czech, there even exists a saying """"speaking like a Bulgarian"""" for unintelligible speech. Yet the difficulties in understanding lie mainly in grammar (the non-existence of word-endings, the use of articles). You can listen to a Bulgarian, not to understand a word and doubt, if you are actually listening to an Indo-European language - and then you see a Bulgarian text and you are surprised that you can read it quite with ease. So the difference in understanding spoken language and written language can be huge. 
As for the difference between Czech/Slovak and Polish, I must agree with the Polish contributor above that a fluent conversation is not possible. Yet you can certainly understand a lot and conduct some conversation, if you try to be patient. So """"a limited intelligibility"""" would be a more correct term. As for written Polish, Czechs and Slovaks shouldn't have any difficulties with a general understanding Polish text, although quite a few words (especially of technical sort) may seem obscure and untintelligible. However, the closest Slavic language to Czech (after Slovak) is Lusitan Sorbian, especially Upper Sorbian. I don't have any personal experience with this language, but from the written texts I saw I think that its resemblance to Czech can be compared to East Slovakian dialects (which means that you can understand some passages easily, but subsequently you can be lost due to accumulation of weirdly sounding words.)

You tried to say that ALL AMERICANS HAVE INCEST on the Jeremy Clarkson page and went to great lengths to make it stay that way... I HAD YOU REVERSED... you're burned. You were wrong. Now it has the correct quote AND the source. I was suspended for my troubles. You tried VERY hard to prevent this. It's all there in the history. You are a weasel. I'm sorry that they picked on you in school, but picking on me is gonna make your life much worse.

When I tried to start a discussion about it, you repeatedly deleted my TOPIC. you even had your little friends wrongfully block me.

So.... FUCK YOU and Eat shit.

I WILL make sure that your NOMINATION page reflects the truth.

Fuck you very much.

You bullied the wrong person.

 Yes, the above IP is AHLM. But I can say with a high level of accuracy that the other troll IPs/sock accounts are not. I would agree that AHLM is not the perfect example of a good editor and may have attitude issues. But that is something that could also improve over time. He needs to be instructed and guided firmly. There's a high possibility that his account is compromised and he's been shut out for the wrong reason (not that it excuses his other actions). I have been long enough on Wikipedia to see newby editors maturing over time and later becoming very constructive (and even an asset) to Wikipedia. That is why I would be willing to lend some good faith to AHLM. But before that, AHLM has to 1) sort out the behaviour issues; and 2) use the correct procedure and that is already specified. He also needs to sort out the security-related issues with his account and computer if someone else is messing around. '''''' (talk) """,0.0

I don't object to your content edit, but you blew away the citation referencing I did on the existing source. That's lazy editing. I spent a great number of hours formatting over 100 citations on that article so that it would have nice complete footnotes, and I don't appreciate having the sweat of my labor turned into an inline URL that might go dead in a month. Please take more care in the future. -  

Lazy editing is removing factual information which you could have sourced in 3 seconds work. I'd say content is considerably more important than formatting a citation prettily. Derex 
 Excuse me, but I spent five minutes formatting that source, including verifying what was in the article. My edit was proper. It brought the claim in line with the source provided. Your edit removed a valid citation, and replaced it with a simple inline link, which works against the interest of the project. A cite is still valid with a dead link, if the publishing info is there. But when an inline link goes dead without that information, it is much more difficult to find again. I know, because I had to chase down about a third of the citations in that article over the past couple of weeks. So don't get snarky with me. Just have a little respect for the work of others, and be a little more careful next time. -  

Excuse me, but I spent 3 seconds finding a source for that, including reading the google synopsis of the very top hit. Please don't remove trivially sourced content from Wikipedia, which works against the interest of the project. My edit removed neither facts nor citations. Pretty formatting is all very nice, but this is an encylopedia. There is nothing at all wrong with adding inline links, as I did, particularly when they support the facts in an article. My edit was proper. So don't get snarky with me. Just have a little respect for the factual content added by others, and be a little more careful next time. - Derex 
 Not one of my edits removed the source that the anon editor provided. WP:ATT requires that the editor inserting the claim source it properly. The claim did not match the source, so I simply adjusted it during the primary act of adding actual citation information to to URL. According to WP:ATT, it is not my responsibility to further source every claim that an anon adds to an article. It is my responsibility, according to an agreement made on the talk page, to properly cite all the sources that were in the article, so that they may be further verified. A proper citation, with author, title, publisher, and date, is always preferable (even with NO url) to a simple URL. If some high school kid is researching at the library, and he finds a good citation, he can look that article up on microfiche, but if all that is there is a dead link, he's screwed. Now you can keep deluding yourself that you are right and I am wrong, but no one is going to buy that line of bullshit. If you continue to undo the improvement of source citations that I am doing, the you and I are going to have a big problem. -",0.0

My humble Wikiquestion is - are editors even held accountable for libel or slander, as in real life, considering the reach and readership of Wikipedia.  What checks and balances are in place for rogue editor & admin, sophisticated in the policies, but manipulating said polices to achieve the same results.

In reading and researching, it would appear that many Editors and Admins, are behaving, contrary to the lofty goals of the Wikiproject, in order to forward personal or political agenda. Also what evidence is necessary to prove and rebuke and discipline such editors and Admin that are consistently and repeatedly violating 3RR and NPOV policy, if not in name, but certainly in sprit and in fact accuse other editors, who perform legitimate edits for the very thing that these rouges are engaged in?

Is what Wikipdia critics say is true, in that Wikipdia is the play ground of the faceless and nameless, who are not beholding or accountable to the rule of law or is Wikipdia truly has respected place, with proper review, oversight or accountability for actions, contrary to stated and publish policy?

My experance, so far, with due respect, would be the first, rather then the later.

Dear Sir,

First, please do not email Jimmy Wales about Wikipedia issues. We have official
contact addresses for this - Jimmy just forwards misdirected emails to them and
thus contacting him simply increases delays.

We apologize for what happened.

Let me clear some misunderstanding. Wikipedia is operated by volunteers, not by
employees of Jimmy Wales or the Wikimedia Foundation. This may account for some
amount of disorganization. If you expect professional service, then, obviously,
Wikipedia cannot provide it, because it is not a professional organization.

""""Willy on Wheels"""" is/was the name of a very obnoxious user that laid waste on
Wikipedia. He kept on creating accounts with usernames based on 'willy' and 'wheels'.

Because of this, there is a de facto standing order against creating account names
based on 'willy' and 'wheels'.

The simplest solution by far is for you to take an account name that does not
include both 'willy' and 'wheels'.

Yours sincerely,
Bernard Dupre

1.  My intentions after the second ban was not to create another account using Willy and Wheels. I never told you that was what I wanted. I was confused at why I was banned from even commenting and my IP was banned.

2. I don't care what distruction this other person caused, calling someone you do not know bogus as Ohnoitsjamie did should not be tolerated. I was not and am not here to cause trouble.

3. Saying that I am here to harrass and threaten is wrong. I read your incident report. I also read the block you placed on my current IP.  I have not harrassed and I have not threatened. I simply want an apology for what I have deemed bad relations on you and Ohno's part.

4. All I want is a sincere apology for calling me bogus and accusing me of threats and harrassment and then I will go away.  If not, I will forward all messages before and from this point on to Mr. Dupre and what administrator actions need to be taken will be taken. His apology in the second line says it all.

"Creating subarticles as needed to bring this article to a usable length 

Currently, Monsanto is WAY too long to be reasonably useful as a general encyclopedia article, and much of the content, which at times goes into great detail on specific topics, would be better served in subarticles.

It is well over 25,000 words of readable copy (reference section excluded), which is approaching three times the recommendation in WP:SIZE. In practical terms, at an average reading rate of 200-250 wpm, it's in the region of a 2-hour read.

Compounding the problem, about 80% of the article is a poorly organized mix of product descriptions, and related political, legal and social issues and information. This is as challenging for editors as it is for readers, because it is hard to locate if and where particular details are covered.

On the positive side, the article's introduction is concise, readable, and seems to cover the key points - history, business, social - quite well. (A strictly length-constrained direct expansion of the intro would probably result in a good main article.)

Creating subarticles is an established, quick, and relatively straightforward way to address this problem<, requiring simply moving existing subsections to their own article pages and replacing them with, initially at least, the briefest of summaries that can later be expanded and refined as necessary, along with Main article redirect tags.

Based on the current article structure, the following subarticles suggest themselves:

Monsanto#Legal_actions_and_controversies > Monsanto legal actions and controversies
Monsanto#Products_and_associated_issues > Monsanto product issues

With summary content for the two daughtered subsections, this would bring the article to an easy-to-navigate 9,000 or so words.

Of course, this isn't a magic bullet solution, but it will immediately bring the article to a usable length, while hopefully avoiding a breakout of contentious editing and edit warring in the main article, at least, by directing the editing of issue details to the subarticles (which could use a thorough reorganization).",0.0

Thank you, Dave, and thank you for your welcome on “My Talk”.

“This section was started with discussion of """"bias in favor of Darwin's theory"""" raising the issue of misrepresentation of Darwin by anti-evolutionists, and as discussed above, we have to give due weight to the overwhelming scientific majority view on the basic subject of evolution.”

I certainly agree with that. 

But on the issue of using “realised”, I just have a couple of things to say. But as a preamble, if you like, I want to make the distinction between a theory and the reality that scientists etc test it against (I’m not being insulting, I assume everyone knows this already, but I’m making a case). Scientists don’t “prove” theories are true. But by conducting experiments they falsify the “bad” theories (again I assume you know this and obviously this is in agreement with the philosophy of Karl Popper).

Now,  I think it’s bad practice to state things in such a way that a theory sounds like it’s the “truth” (meaning in perfect agreement with reality) because it destroys this distinction (between theory, or scientific fact, and reality or truth. To say that “X realised that Y”, where Y is a theory, is suggesting that Y is “in perfect agreement with reality”. Now, I think the statement “all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors” does correspond perfectly with reality, but I also think we need to remember that it is still a theory (nothing is proven, remember, according to Popper) consistent with the general scientific method and perspective I already briefly outlined. Of course, in the case of evolution, someone arguing like this sounds rather silly  - it sounds like you’re being pedantic bordering on obsessive. Of course not all theories are the same - Popper would argue that theories that have “survived” criticism and rigorous testing are more “corroborated” (but never fully verified). But even if you wanted to make some exceptions, like the statement “all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors”, for the sake of scientific consistency, I think we should refrain from using “realised” in this context (incidentally, in regards to making exceptions, I certainly wouldn’t make any exceptions in respect to the sources given by David Wilson - these seem to me to be much more egregious cases of the word “realised”).

Anyway, so much for theory. As far as concrete help is concerned, have you thought about deleting “who realised that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors” altogether?  You probably know more about the history of evolution than I do, but I thought that this idea didn’t actually come from Darwin (I could be wrong, of course). But if it does, what about “Charles Robert Darwin FRS (12 February 1809 – 19 April 1882) was an English naturalist who first proposed the fact that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors, and also the scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection” or some variation on this?

Well, one issue at a time:
The last sentence of the 1st paragraph truncates the narrative by jumps from one subject (internal policy) to another (foreign policy), before falling from the sky after decades to following paragraph without even suggest the reason of 1920s military revolts (not to mention that even remotely touches the civilian ones).
To remedy the last flaw of this paragraph, and with citations (easy to check) in English (other section's defect: too many sources in Portuguese, one of them is not even specific to Brazilian history) and
before to deal with the 2nd paragraph [ one issue at a time ) ], I suggest to let the 1st paragraph fine and end the discussion about this paragraph, 
I propose that the mention concerning to changes of Brazil's boundaries  in the early 20th century (even because, the border issue of Acre, in addition to not being the only one of that era, contained in itself a military phase, among others, having not been characterized or reduced to a mere purchase...), be placed at the beginning of the 3rd paragraph in the foreign affairs: 
 """"In foreign policy, the success in resolving border disputes with neighboring countries in the early years of the republican period,* was followed by a failed attempt to exert a prominent role in the League of Nations,* after its involvement in World War I.***"""" ; 
more or less eg as I had proposed, both with a neutral point of view and specific easily checking citations in english...

So, if you agree to it in relation to the 1st paragraph, I will talk about my suggestions of changes regarding the 2nd and 3rd paragraphs and (again) why of it...

Let's see, accusations of parroting, arbitrary classification of users based upon pen-name preferences, straw-men, ignoratio elenchi, and finally begging the question through the same fallacious reasoning as previously. We call that petitio principii, don't we? Apparently nothing will change his mind until I change my pen-name to something like John Doe. How does he know that I am not this Russian dude who likes Iranian history and culture? Oh, that's right, he doesn't. He probably didn't check my IP-address to see that I'm based in Sweden and could in fact be a Swede. Whoops... Sounds like our neutralist is using a subtle profiling method to his convenience.

Like I stated before, it doesn't matter if I'm a Nazi, Communist, Liberal or even a hippie. It doesn't matter if I do drugs, or if I look even remotely like a reptile. It doesn't matter if I'm even an obese Tongan kid. It has no bearing on content or the essentials of an argument, and anything else you might conjure to the favour of some imagined affiliation. This is aptly called speculation.

Now, I will only say two things. First one is a rehearsal of my previous suggestion: Livius.org is visited by thousands of people daily. Along with a number of other scholar-related websites, I can't live without checking it by a daily basis. It deserves a Wiki-article, where Jona Lendering is briefly described as the founder and maintainer of an outlet with roots as far back as -96. Yes, sounds like a plan of revenge. The paragon of Pan-Iranic resurgence! The removal of a Wiki-article of Lendering will remove the last great obstacle to a resurgent Achaemenid empire and the reawakening of the terrifying Persian horsemen of doom! Howl! Howl! Our world is forfeit!

Second point, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart: Get laid. Your superior-inferior complex isn't convincing anyone here, whether they be Iranian or not. There is no chance an article of this quality gets to stay. That's the bottom line, irrespective of any perceived reasoning. Either change the article so that it pertains to Livius.org, or stop your incessant whining. Maybe it never occurred to you that by simple observation Jona Lendering has written several Iran-friendly articles and has generally sought to dispel several popular misconceptions on the ancient Iranians. Maybe that's how you make more drama in your life, by arbitrary holier-than-thou attitude.

This article is indeed biased due to the use of adjectives projected upon the EDL. Within the wiki talk page there appears to be sufficient evidence that the characterization of the EDL has not been fact-based, but in some cases the opinion of opposition groups. This very argument is taking place on the talk page of the UAF where they have successfully garnered favorable edits to their own description with the omission of the term left-wing, yet the EDL ‘s group type currently stands as “far right-wing”.  Even when the nature of a topic is agreeably abhorrent, the moment one describes said topic with words such as atrocity or (insert)phobic, the subject has become tainted with opinion.  As the world descends upon Wikipedia to learn about these groups due to recent events; it is vital that factual information be provided. I’ve never heard of the EDL until a few days ago, yet someone like myself, untainted by prejudice; can see this article is biased at face-value. Lacking an omnipotent author, the introductory description of the EDL should largely come from how the EDL describes itself. Any evidence to the contrary should be cited properly where Wikipedia provides.

I'm not sure why he assumes that all of the 500 BC inscriptions in Sabaean (does he mean script or language?) were made by Sabaeans either, since Ethiopians used the same script...

 Infobox cast list/billing 

I've noticed that the order of the cast list has been changed several times in the past few weeks, mostly moving Patrick Dempsey and/or Isaiah Washington higher in the list.  I'm guessing that this has been done based on perceived importance in the castobviously those two names are frequently in the press and PD's """"McDreamy"""" is a huge pop culture thing and it could be argued that PD/Ellen Pompeo and IW/Sandra Oh are the two """"big"""" couples on the show, but that has nothing to do with the order of billingnor is the placement of IW and PD at the bottom of the list someone's idea of belittling their roles on the show.  I double-checked the order with the most recently aired episode, and based on that I switched T.R. and Justin Chambers, as well as JP, Jr. and Kate Walsh.  The credits read, """"with Isaiah Washington and Patrick Dempsey""""that final billing with the preposition """"with"""" is actually a good thing, it reflects upon the actors' value to the show.

By the grace of G-d
Greetings and blessings. 
I have edited the links section to add few Mashichist sites to give a greater range  of Chabad views on the issue of identity of Moshiach and the proccess of redemption. While I realize Wikipedia is not a link list I feel that all those sites should be included. I have also moved the """"Breif history of Chabad Messianism""""  to the historical sites section from it's original location in the Chabad Messianic sites section since it's not a Mashichist propaganda, but the author of the article simply presents an overview of the development of the Moshiach identification campaign within Chabad and further states elsewhere on his site that he doesn't believe the Rebbe is Moshiach therefore it obviously doesn't belong in the Chabad Messianic sites section.
I have also added the http://www.YudelKrinsky.com as satire is just another way to convey information and studying it creates a clearer picture about the issue in the mind of a serious Wikipedia reader.

That is a good point about John Locke (I do know who he is, he's even taught in our local middle school, just by the way, haha), he was very influential, but he was a philosopher, not a theologian. Many church goers, whether self-identifying Christians or not, and many self-identifying Christians, whether church-goers or not, do not believe in original sin. I have no idea how many, or what kind of proportion that would be out of the total populations of their respective groups. However, original sin is a biblical doctrine. Babies going to hell because they were not baptised, however, is not. The Bible is not very specific about that issue. It is a Catholic doctrine, yes, but we need to keep doctrines voiced by all of Christianity and parts of Christianity distinct in this article. The Protestant stance is that babies, both born and unborn, whatever they do, are not held accountable until the age of accountability, or the age of reason, at which point they know the difference between right and wrong. Roman Catholicism also holds this idea, so I'm wondering now how babies could go to hell when they can not be held accountable for sin? They have their inherited sinful nature (original sin), sure, but that's different from actually committing a sin. Is the official Roman Catholic stance then that all people are born destined for Hell, whether or not they've actually lived long enough TO sin and thus separate themselves from God and so choose eternal death over eternal life? Honest question here, I'm not trying to bash the Catholic Church.

 Explanation 

Hi, I thought I'd explain why the pages keep getting deleted. The long and short is that we're really not quite sure what you are trying to do. The pages are given extremely unwieldy titles that are written like sentences, which makes them an unlikely search term. The pages also didn't assert how Razin was notable. 

I think that you were likely trying to write about Stepan Razin, as he was part of the Solovetsky Monastery Uprising. However I don't see anything on his page to show that he was an artist. You commented somewhere that there were paintings of his on eBay, which makes it unlikely that these two Razins are the same person. It's possible, but extremely unlikely. I think that the Razin that's a painter is probably a far more recent person since a search for """"S Razin"""" (the name that comes up in the eBay auctions) shows that he's from the 21st century, not from the 1600s.

Derby police were aware of rumours of a paedophile gang operating in the city.[1] On 30 December 2008, Staffordshire police stopped a car on suspicion of shoplifting, carrying three gang members and three young girls.[3] The girls had been reported missing from a care home in Derby.[3] The police drove the girls back to Derby, and during the journey, they told the officers about what had been taking place.[1] Derbyshire police force launched an undercover investigation called Operation Retriever, setting up surveillance and tailing the gang's BMW around Derby.[1] Detectives collected DNA samples from several of the crime scenes.[5] Siddique was wearing an electronic tag after a previous conviction for assaulting a woman.[1]

On 24 April 2009, two distressed teenagers stumbled out of a flat that was under surveillance and said that they had been raped.[3] The police had been unaware of their presence. The victims told the police of other girls who had been assaulted, and the police soon discovered a campaign of systematic grooming and abuse within the city. Detective Inspector of Derbyshire police, Shaun Dawson, said, """"When we arrested them, we had no idea of the scale of this. Once we had them locked up other victims spoke out and it snowballed from there.""""[1] Debbie Platt, who led the police investigation, said she was shocked at the extent of the abuse and said it was like """"a campaign of rape against children.""""[3] The police stated that the abuse could have continued for a lot longer.[1]

I'll start with the line """"Derby police were aware of rumours of a paedophile gang operating in the city."""" - which simply implies the past. I believe that there needs to be clarity of time frames - otherwise it can be taken to mean that there has always been some paedophile gang operating in the city since the dawn of time! Are there any sources which place the time frame before 30 December 2008 with any degree of certainty (Decade - year - first known event) which allow for an accurately constructed time line to be presented. A generic reference to the past is not really good enough.

Walk away, as in walk away from the argument. Why would I walk away from an article? That is just silly. See WP:SOAPBOX. Please, stop it.
The consensus that was created allowed both POVs in the lead paragraph, allowing for the statement about non-citizens claiming American identity, which is sourced by a source provided by .
I really don't see what the argument here is. Both POV's are provided due weight. Both views are presented. The content was improved by adding percentages of non-citizens counted by the census.
Therefore, please walk away.  
The introduction consensus is Citizens of the United States are referred to as Americans. Although citizens make up the majority of Americans, non-citizen residents, dual citizens and expatriates may also claim an American identity."""" 

It places Sparkie82 point of view front and center. What is the rationale for removing """"non-citizen residents, dual citizens and expatriates"""" which other editors sought to include as they are counted by the U.S. census as sourced and included in discussions throughout the literature? To change, there must be a rationale, a counter-source, and context among the preponderance of sources which include more than citizens so as to gain a new consensus on the Talk page.   

@TheVirginiaHistorian I'm fine with what you just said was the consensus, i.e., """"Citizens of the United States are referred to as Americans. Although citizens make up the majority of Americans, non-citizen residents, dual citizens and expatriates may also claim an American identity."""" That is a compromise version we reached a while ago. However, RightCowLeftCoast keeps changing the first sentence to: """"Americans, or American people, are citizens of the United States of America."""" and then he declares that his version (which he has been defending for years!) is a consensus, which it is not. At this point, I sincerely question his able to act in good faith.  (t•c)  

@RightCowLeftCoast, if you sincerely want to see the article be the best that it can be and you trust the community to tend to the article, and you don't simply want to keep inserting your own version into it, then please stop editing the article. If you do, I will also stop editing it. What is your answer?  (t•c)  
The edit made changed the lead paragraph which was stable for several months, claiming to change it to a consensus version, while not. It failed to provide references for the lead sentence, which the stable version has in spades. Futhermore, the sentence in the stable version remains in the lead paragraph after the second sentence which explaining the multicultural nature of Americans. This sets up for the third sentence. All the content is well cited and, the cite added in the reverted edit by Sparkie82 is a duplicate source from the current third sentence.
The fact that Americans are Citizens of the United States is very well cited in the stable version.
As this is about article content this is better of in the Americans talk page and not my talk page, and kindly ask Sparkie82 to leave me alone.  """,0.0

 Plot 
I changed  this is a highly fictionalised account of Thompson and attorney Oscar Zeta Acosta's actual trip to Las Vegas around the same time period.
This is contracticed many times through out the article. In one instance, under the Pre production sub heading it says:
Depp remembers, """"He saved it all. Not only is [the book] true, but there's more. And it was worse.

Later on under the sub heading Reaction, it says:
Apparently it all came flooding back to him, he was reliving the whole trip! He was yelling out and jumping on his seat like it was a rollercoaster, ducking and diving, shouting 'SHIT! LOOK OUT! GODDAM BATS!' That was fantastic – if he thought we'd captured it, then we must have done it.
Although it is a far fetched story, it is not highly fictionalised and regardless, it can't say it is if there are statements throughout the rest of the article from direct sources that are saying it is real.   """,0.14285714285714285

"This is an excellent question (though, perhaps, not in the right forum). While I agree that the vast majority of tenured academics are not notable (at most schools, tenure is not really that hard), there is the question of top notch professors who are respected by their communities but don't make it into the popular press. Should we have a different notability criterion for them? My feeling is that there is no hurry. If a professor is significant in his or her community, they'll sooner or later get a chair at their, presumably well known, university and that, for us, is a sufficient condition for inclusion. As with everything else, we need some reliable indicator of notability and these indicators exist in academia so we shouldn't get into the business of trying to determine notability ourselves.

I can cast some light on:

1. CZMarlin's contribution 

CZMarlin is a tireless promoter of AMC vehicles (he owns at least two and has a website dedicated to AMC products). As he knows, I have developed the view that he seems to use the project quite persistently as a PR medium for the defunct corporation and its products. It is, I believe, to this end that, it seems to me, he has habitually fought against sourced material that brings neutrality and balance to articles on AMC products, e.g. AMC Pacer, Gremlin etc.  

It is true that I was deeply frustrated by the apparent determination with which he misrepresented others’ contributions in order to justify their deletion, e.g. . I was also frustrated by his apparent insistence on idiosyncratic and erroneous interpretations of the English language, and also by what appeared to be deliberately erroneous interpretation of verifiable facts, e.g.   errors that cannot be permitted in an  encyclopedia.  

My sincere belief that English was not CZM’s first language arose from the manner in which he uses it and the difficulties of communicating with him. (Examples on request.) I disagree that I belittled him for it – as a non-native English speaker myself, it's not something I would do.  Indeed I offered to help him with the language (offer ignored) and told him he could seek help from WP volunteer translators, so that he could write in Polish (also ignored).  

True, I ridiculed him when his behaviour seemed so extreme as to appear ridiculous to me.  I should not have done so. But we get frustrated when we try to work with an editor who, it seems, demonstrates provocatively scant regard for factual accuracy, neutrality, balance and clarity of communication . Granted, I should not have let my frustration show. 

The 'known vandal' CZM mentions is in fact an IP address used by one or more people. The address had a history of vandalism. When I saw a constructive edit from it I tried to encourage the contributor in her/his constructive behaviour; and later suggested the sandbox for experiments:  , . My posts encouraged constructive behaviour. 

CZM's damaging claim that these posts encouraged disruptive behaviour is totally false. (This gives a flavour of the difficulties I had with him.) It also casts serious doubt on the reliability of his contribution here, and also on his good faith.

He implies that my use of the term 'AMC cuckoos' was insulting. Not so, as he well knows, because I explained it to him when he showed that he had misunderstood the idiom: I used the term in an edit summary to describe the long-winded and inappropriate descriptions of certain AMC cars that he had introduced  like cuckoos in a nest  into an article on a certain aspect of automotive aerodynamics .

My  'another sophomoric CZM error' was mischievous but (IMO) harmless retaliation for CZM’s previous sniffy dismissal of some Google research I had posted to a discussion, which he denigrated as 'sophomoric research'. He seems to have forgotten that.  

The reference to 'little fuhrer' is more serious, and I should not have used it even though it mentioned no names (so no harm done to CZM’s reputation). Why that particular metaphor? I’m afraid I regarded CZM’s approach to editing as uncollaborative and perfunctory to the point of being dictatorial; and ruthless in its uncritical promotion of AMC and its products.

2. Collect’s contribution 

Just as he could list my transgressions (""""I have a list of [Writegeist's] comments""""), so also could I recite a litany of his own. Meh. Tit for tat gets us nowhere.

However it is worth noting that an antagonism grew between us at the Sarah Palin pages when it became apparent to Collect that I disagreed with much of his input, whereas he had assumed from one of my earliest contributions there that I would be an ally (he left an appreciative note on my Talk). Yet despite the difficulties between us, it was with scrupulous fairne",0.0

Holy crap.. Lest someone mistakenly visit a talk page, expecting to read some truth and hence be confused reading this gentleman's comment and mistaking the writer for someone who knows what they're talking about, I'd just like to point out the above explanation for the word """"handicap"""" is complete bollocks. handicap has meant """"to place at a disadvantage"""" for a long long time. According to Merriam Webster, the etymology is """"Etymology:
    obsolete English handicap, a game in which forfeit money was held in a cap, from hand in cap"""", which obviously has nothing at all to do with being """"Handy with a cap"""" or even related to the disabled. Certain individuals may have a negative connotation with the use of the term, which happens merely due to the words close association with 1960's era community welfare practices, but that is an individuals choice to associate negativity with the word, not the words fault at all.

"==Please read unblock request carefully

This why I ask whoever read my request to read it carefully , I will address your points in order of when your address them.

First, your said that you will work with the editor to help make the page notable, yet that is what I was asking for throughout the entire debate before I was blocked, for someone to help me make the page notable. I cannot help showing I was annoyed when everyone who posted on that debate was making negative comments and continued to push for it to be deleted. Seen as I was the person making ALL the editing, it is the responsibility for administrators to assist me making all pages in question notable. I had already said sorry for the choice of words I've made throughout the debate but again it is as if no-one has the desire to care whether a user is remorseful of his action so long as the debate can continue, with or without them. 

Second, if the only party that was trying to defend the case was blocked and prevent not only from actively defending the pages in question, but stopped from actually adding the references and making the page more notable, well I'm sorry but I was doing my best all things considering. Even before I was blocked from Wikipedia, I did add in more reference, I read some of the notability guild lines and did make some changes, however I am only one person and there is so much I could do before I can say, 'I done my fair share, can someone help me finish this?'. But clearly not. I really don't know Wikipedia as well as you and other administrators do, but considering I have made many pages and edited many more in the short time I have started using Wikipedia properly, I can say that I have made useful information for people to read about and get accurate accounts of this. My point with this is that even though I have made massive contributions on here, there are things I do not know, and how to get pages back on Wikipedia after they are deleted is one of them. So if you kindly give me details and links on how to do this would be most appreciated.

I still fail to see why it is disrupted behaviour to return pages back on Wikipedia the way I have, a page before on Ryan Shamrock (fighter) was speedily deleted and then returned back on here, but not by me, and up until just today, no-one has affected that. The user who is suggesting it has also recommended 10 other pages for deletion, however, the user clearly doesn't know the fighters he wants deleted, as 7 of them are/have competed in either a major MMA promotion or a second tier promotion. As he is doing such pointless acts, I still wonder why he's able to do this knowing he will get into trouble with other admins for the similar things I've done? Here is the link for this debate - Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ryan Shamrock (fighter).

I get what you do mean when you say that it isn't about Shark Fights or Ring of Combat when it comes to this debate now, but none the less it is still an issue not to be ignored. UCMMA/Cage Rage UK was deleted for the same reasons that those two promotions, as well as a few other promotions on WP:MMANOT, should be. I find it amazing how these promotions are actually accepted by certain admins and are allowed to remain on there whilst a promotion I've been helping with, that has a better laid out page than the others and was making the improvements the other users were screaming on about doing for it, yet it got deleted, whilst those others ones get treated like they are highly ranked promotions. UCMMA/Cage Rage UK has a weekly chat show on Sky Sports 4, whilst showing their delayed timed events on Sky Sports 3, I bet those other promotions don't even get TV time.

The head of Cage Rage UK never asked me to post those articles. I have always worked by myself to help them with their Wikipedia page, never even expecting a thank you because I like their product and want to help other find reliable sources on them, which as many knows, Wikipedia is the place for that. If you type in UCMMA in the Facebook search bar, find the one with a picture of the words 'Cage' on the top, 'Rage' in the middle, and 'UK.com' at the bottom, then like their page, then keep looking for any posts from Carl Gale, as I keep mentioning to look on Wikipedia for UCMMA/Cage Rage UK information, fights at certain events etc. Look as far back as the 1st September 2011, you will clearly see that not only was UCMMA not part of it, they were pretty much telling me that all their information can be found on their website and their Facebook account so there was no need to continue doing it. However, I kept working on the Wikipedia pages, making contributions whenever possible leading up until their UCMMA 24 - Hands of War event.

Hello, Doradus. A request has been made at Wikipedia:Changing username/Usurpations to usurp, or """"take over"""", your username because you have not used it to edit, and another user would like to use it to edit. Wikipedia:Changing username/Usurpations says that any unused username may be usurped if the user is given seven days notice to object and does not do so. 

If you have an email set in your preferences, you should be getting an email from a bureaucrat or changing username clerk explaining how to consent or object to this process. 

If you do not object to being renamed to a new username in order for another user to use the name you currently have, please log in and post a reply here saying so (you may also tell us what username you would like to be renamed to, or we will provide you with a generic one). 

If you do nothing: the request will be filled after seven days, and your account will be moved to a generic username. You may request that it be moved to a new username of your choice at any time.

If you object to being renamed: please log in and make an edit to this page clearly stating that you object to usurpation. 

Please note that even if your current username is usurped, you can still edit and your data will not be lost; your preferences, watchlist, and other user settings will be transferred to a new username.

 Neutrality? 

""""There are also allegations that the attention and sympathy especially from the Australian public and media may be related to xenophobic sentiment and a unfair mistrust of Asian legal systems. Also, many think there was no motive for Corby to transport marijuana from Brisbane to Bali where the value is far less, and where it is readily available on the street not far from her prison (and even within it), i.e. it would be like smuggling ice to Eskimos.""""

This seems POV to me.  (Of course, in the interests of full disclosure I believe that she is guilty).

I added some referencing to a Sydney Morning Herald article where it was alleged that Australian marijuana (in particular hydroponically grown marijuana) sold quite well in Bali for a few reasons:
 Indonesian marijuana is quite poor in quality - rich tourists generally prefer the Australian stuff.
 Due to the lack of entrapment laws in Indonesia, tourists can often be caught by Balinese police stings - and so prefer to buy their marijuana off other whites, who are less likely to be members of the Indonesian police.

I can understand the text on the (turns out to be non-lethal) white powder being sent to the embassy being removed.  I believe that even though a link hasn't been established between the two events that this incident will have a bearing on the case, and especially its portrayal (spelling?) in Indonesia, but I can see why the lack of a clear connection between the two events has led to its removal.

That said, I cannot understand why the text on """"smuggling ice to Eskimos"""" is allowed to remain whereas the text from the Sydney Morning Herald, a respected (within Australia at least) news source is not.  If the view that there would be no point smuggling marijuana to Indonesia is allowed to remain, why not the view that there would be a point, especially if that view is put forward by a major Australian newspaper?  The article seems POV and biased in favour of Corby to me.

Mario Party 4 is the fourth in a series of board game style video games for Nintendo platforms, featuring popular Nintendo characters. It was released on the Nintendo GameCube in North America on October 21, 2002 strangely before the Japanese release on November 8, 2002. It was released on November 29, 2002 in Europe, being heavily criticised for being 'Nintendo's big GameCube Game' for Christmas 2002 as Metroid Prime was delayed until March 2003.

Mario Party 4 was the first Mario Party that was released on the Nintendo GameCube. Each board had its own host, including Toad, Goomba, Shy Guy, Koopa, and Boo. Mario Party 4 also contains some characters new to the franchise; Thwomp and Whomp. Klepto, Dolphin, Lakitu, and Star, along with two completely new characters named Genie of the Lamp and Ztar, are included as well. Mario Party 4 retains the Story Mode found in Mario Party 3.

The game, as usual, contains a standard party mode in which up to four players play through a board, trying to collect as many Stars as possible. The Star Space would appear randomly on the board, and players would have to reach it before anyone else. However, the Stars carry a price tag of 20 coins, and player has to earn those coins by winning minigames, which take place at the end of each turn (after all the players have rolled the Dice Block, which will always roll a number from one to ten).

Battle minigames are like the 4-player games, but generally (with many exceptions) a little more elaborate. Battle games are usually tense because every player has to put a certain number of coins (from 5 - 50) into a pot. First place gets 70% of the pot, second place gets 30%, and a random player gets any coins lost in rounding. 

Every Mario Party contains 60 to 80 minigames of a few different types. Four-player games are a free-for-all in which all players compete against each other. 2-on-2 and 1-on-3 minigames put players in groups, so they have to cooperate in the minigame to win, even though they are against each other in the main game. In most situations, winners of these games make 10 coins each.

A new addition to the Mario Party series was the Bowser mini-games. Players play in a very elaborate mini-game that ends when one player is eliminated in various ways. (See Bowser mini-game section below) The loser loses a pre-specified item, usually coins or items.

Spaces
There is various spaces you can land in the game. The following is a list of them, and what they do.
Blue Space - You get three coins. Also, there is a special feature on this game called Hidden Blocks, in which a star or coins may be hidden on random blue spaces.
Red Space - You lose three coins.
Green Happening Space - A special board event takes place.
Warp Space - You are sent to the same space as an opponent. A spinner chooses which opponent's space you will warp to.
Mushroom Space - Two boxes will appear (one big and one small). Choose one, and you will be given either a Mini Mushroom or a Mega Mushroom. (Note: The Mega Mushroom is not always in the large box, and the Mini Mushroom is not always in the small box.)
Battle Space - A battle minigame will start in which players put a chosen amount of coins into a pot. The better you finish in the minigame, the more coins you will get back from the pot.
Bowser Space - Bowser may steal items from players or a Bowser minigame may begin.
Fortune Space - A reversal of fortune begins, in which players may have to give coins or stars to others. The player who landed",0.0

Reply from ColonelHenry
I have been pissed this week, I admit. Why?
 First, last week, I get harassed by one hypocritical """"rule nazi"""" editor taking things too far (SummerPhD) so when I pointed out her similar shortcomings and intransigence and said frankly """"this user is an asshole"""" and explain why and state """"this is the kind of user that drives editors away from wikipedia"""" I get blocked for 24-hours.  I say """"asshole"""" once, I get blocked.  She calls me a """"dick"""" over a dozen times, and gets warned.  Go figure. I hate nitpicking rule nazis because they end up proving themselves to be hypocrites, and unfortunately without fool other meek fools who tend to be admins tend to side with the rule nazi.
 In the midst of that Daniel Case continued to plow ahead insisting on a rushed revision of ALONJ that no one else raised as a concern (so, not immediately dire) after being asked first politely and respectfully several times to """"wait until after TFA"""" and he still ignored it.  If someone politely asked me to wait a few days before doing a drastic edit on an article they worked on that was getting a little attention, I would...because I find it akin to telling a concert pianist to change their entire concert programme an hour before the recital. Only when I responded in anger did he pull back on the reins and realize """"hey, maybe I should wait till after TFA.""""  A little deference on his part would have gone a long way.  I'm not averse to his edits, but seriously, after TFA would have been more than fine.  I considered it insulting, and his refusal to listen to a polite request stated by both myself and the other major contributor to the article was considerably disrespectful.
 And then when the article I've worked on becomes TFA we get inundated with constant vandalism and petty edits that were not necessary (i.e. people like you, Kevjonesin, insisting on 19th instead of nineteenth).  Is that really a necessary place to make a stand and pick a fight? Seriously, don't you have better things to do with your time?  I'd rather argue over an analysis of Hegel's influence on Nietzsche's """"Will to Power"""" or Hindu mysticism in Eliot's Four Quartets than bicker about things as meaningless as whether honour should be spelled -or or -our.

As for why, I like """"nineteenth"""" as opposed to 19th, several style guides (including Chicago/Turabian) advocates it, and growing up I was taught that all numbers under 20 should be spelled out. Whether cutting two dozen letters from an article going to 19th and 20th is going to make a difference for """"brevity's sake"""" on a 40-page article, is a lame claim and frankly a waste of time for both of us. I like the aesthetic of it spelled out, it's allowed, and the option of spelling it out is a bonus in an article to avoid confusion with too many other numbers.  When considering such an unnecessary subjective edit, deference should be made to style set by the editors who spent months on an article...and when nothing is wrong to it, deference is entirely warranted.  That isn't ownership, it's just courtesy and good judgment. After all, if I stood in your yard while you were painting your house gray and proceeded to insist you to paint your house orange, you'd tell me to """"kick rocks.""""

As far as I'm concerned, this is over. Move on. I am not addressing this any further, because nonsense like this keeps me from contributing and convinces me to leave Wikipedia again, and this time for good.

Angus's suggestion of """"suspected by the IRA of being an informer' is not unreasonable as it indicates that it is a concept or crime particular to that side of the dispute. 
Sarah argues, """"What they are commonly called is what we should reflect here. Any inhabitant of Ireland who assisted with information given to the British was an informer."""" She avoids my earlier point. 'Commonly' has to include, in Ireland, Protestants and Unionists (who were themselves British) and therefore the concept is not common currency unless you regard Protestants as people of no consequence at all in the matter. Can you inform yourself?
And was it in 'common' use in Ireland that you would call someone who had reported a rape or a stray cow an informer? 
Sarah's other point that """"Protestants who openly supported the Republic were never killed. So it wasn't a sectarian matter"""" is risible. As if you execute those who come across to your side? Anyway most Protestant Republicans became Catholics. 
The number of Protestants in Cork who were home rulers would have been tiny and the percentage who supported the separatists minute and can pretty well all be named like Miss Dorothy Stopford or Sam Maguire.

Dear Sir,
I am extremely sorry for my work done in Wikipedia.I understand i am a very poor editor and need some time in perfecting my editing skills.I was under the impression the Hindu paper releases the images in the said license.The purpose of this is to convey to you my sincere apologies for any inconvenience you have experienced during these few weeks.
I just returned from college  and found your message in my talk page.I have also seen the complaints made against by another user.I have in a true sense not vandalized Wikipedia but wanted others to get authentic information.I have use the information from government websites.If i have done something wrong,please correct me.
Sir, let me assure you that what happened was not vandalizing but out of laziness to provide citations.Can i copy the info from the info from govt websites and then add citations and references??(  )",0.0

We've not mentioned Craig's debates in the introductory and the few comments about Molinism that he's made are in no way more significant than his debates.

Scholary Comment sounds like a red herring to me. It is fringe theory whether or not a couple of agenda promoting scholars have tried to draw a link. Slaves were disarmed-there is no question to that. States had militias for protection. Militias were used to put down a couple of slave revolts. Then some illogical thinking takes place and something like this follows: Militias are mentioned in the 2nd amendment and militias had put down slave revolts and thus the 2nd amendment is about surpressing slaves. That is an idiotic, illogical conclusion. The valid argument is suppressed people have had their right to bear arms denied. The Europeans are a suppressed people because as Article XVII of the Commonwealth of Mass. states:""""The people have a right to keep and to bear arms for the common defence. And as, in time of peace, armies are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be maintained without the consent of the legislature; and the military power shall always be held in an exact subordination to the civil authority, and be governed by it.""""

There's a lot to learn when you first start editing Wikipedia, and it can be overwhelming to try to learn it all at once. It may be good to look at some high quality artistic biographies on Wikipedia, such as Bronwyn Bancroft or Dave Stamper to see how those articles do things. 
I've cleaned up your draft a lot. If you click """"View history"""" on the page, you can see the various changes that I made. For instance, with this edit I added several wikilinks. With this edit, I created an introductory sentence, so the reader can know instantly who she is and why she is important.
This next edit is very important: in it I changed the references to use  tags, so that individual statements are sourced. Notice how the first time I cite a source, I use the format url.com. When I later want to use the same reference, I only use the format . If you add more statements from these or other sources, you can reference them in the same way.
I made several other changes, which you can view in the history. I'm sure you'll want to add more information from these two references, and maybe from other references as well. But it should only need another sentence or two before you move it into article-space, at Anneliese von Oettingen. I can help with that too, if you like. All the best, –  (talk)

Both parts are important and should be mentioned in the lead and if you read the references you should realise that this is exceptional to mephedrone as deaths were over-reported and mis-reported by the media - comparisons with other topics are irrelevant.

Enric, you present an impoverished idea of what Wikipedia editors can and should do. We do not report demonstrably false information as fact just because a reliable source says it, unless we balance it. We can and should balance secondary source error with primary source fact. The requirement is that the primary source facts reported should be directly verifiable without synthesis, by any ordinary person with ordinary skill applying reasonable effort. First of all, it's worth reading WP:OR over carefully. Then look at the essay linked from the WP:OR page, WP:NOTOR. See, specifically, this example:
A book, short story, film, or other work of fiction is a primary source for any article or topic regarding that work. Anything that can be observed by a reasonable person simply by reading the work itself, without interpretation, is not original research, but is reliance upon a primary source. This would include direct quotes or non interpretative summaries, publication dates, and any other patent information that can be observed from the work. For example, if there are multiple versions of a particular story, and one version does not have a particular character, or has extra characters, that is clear simply by reading or watching the work. The fact that one would have to read or watch the whole thing does not make the matter original research. The work is verifiable, even if it takes more time than flipping to a single page.
Notice that the example is quite on point here: After reporting what the DoE report says is claimed in the review document about the sixteen samples, 'blah blah.' we could say, """"The Hagelstein paper, which was the review document, does not contain a report of 'blah blah.' However, it does contain 'bleep bleep.'"""" And there is probably more than we can say; there is some criticism of the 2004 report in reliable source, if I'm correct. This tidbit, however, requires no source other than the 2004 DoE material.
Notice also that we probably cannot report, for example, that """"The 2004 DoE report contradicted itself,"""" unless we have secondary source on that. What we properly do is to present the elements of the (alleged) contradiction, without claiming contradiction, reliably sourced, and let the reader form his or her own conclusion. The elements are directly verifiable. The conclusion isn't.   """,0.0

 Breton and Picasso 

Your clarification was in order and I thank for that; Breton was, indeed, a Trotskyist and a bitter enemy of Stalin. As you said, this helps to explain his remark to Picasso.

I would make one correction: Breton was a """"Trotskyist"""". From the Wikipedia website http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trotskyism,  """"In France, 10% of the electorate voted in 2002 for parties calling themselves Trotskyist"""" (my emphasis). I don't think the """"Trotskyite"""" spelling occurs anywhere this Wikipedia page: """"Trotskyist"""" is used throughout, and establishes it as the accepted spelling. 

The same wiki site says: """"Today, in the English language an advocate of Trotsky's ideas is usually called a """"Trotskyist"""" while Trotskyism's opponents usually refer to them pejoratively as a """"Trotskyite"""" or """"Trot"""".[5]"""" In the same way, one is a """"Stalinist"""", not a """"Stalinite"""" whether one likes or dislikes Stalin. 

Advocate or not, let's not use any terms that have a desparaging tone. I know you didn't mean it as such; I used """"Trotskyite"""" myself for many years.

 Your edits to The Red Badge of Courage 

Thank you for your comments at the PR.  I would appreciate it, however, if you refrained from copy-editing; perhaps you could comment instead?  There are several mistakes in this edit alone, which is somewhat unhelpful seeing as how I have to now copy-edit your copy-edits. ;)  Thanks.  (habla conmigo) 
Sure,   
Sadads, thanks for the cupcake (my second in one day).  I feel the need to point out, however, that the comment I made on Truthkeeper's talk page was in no way aimed at you, and in fact did not even mention you.  That you think that comment had anything to do with you saddens me.  No, I do not feel that your suggestions at the PR are entirely helpful as far as what I intend for the article, but my comment re: the Novels WikiProject dealt entirely with what I saw on the talk page after I had posted my request for reviews.  It's not the same project with the same focus that I remember, which is why I ended up removing my post.  Again, this had nothing to do with you or your curriculum vitae.  Since we are now discussing it, however, I'm sure you do a very good job in most of your Wiki endeavors.  Please do be careful in reviewing potential FACs, however; despite the obvious need for reviewers at GAC/PR/FAC, I know that I personally would rather have one very good, knowledgeable reviewer than several who may not be as good and/or knowledgeable.  That is where my frustration stemmed from, and now I know where yours did as well.  Thanks,  (habla conmigo) 
Sigh - my page seems to be causing too much drama these days so I'll bring this here. First, re the grammar, I'll address that on the talk page. If it would help I'm more than happy to send Sage and Awadewit  email  giving them permission to divulge to you their impression of whether I am qualified a; to make judgement regarding literature; and b; to have a sense of what or what not academics here need or want. Would that be helpful at all?  The Red Badge of Courage is of high importance in the canon of Am lit and needs to be done right. I was quite careful in the GA review before passing it. There is perhaps room for development regarding themes, but what's there is presented succinctly and is easy to read. Quite honestly I'm tempted to take the monstrosity I've created with The Sun Also Rises and simplify following the example of Red Badge. Anyway, thanks for the pie - I even have a chair on my page, so I can sit and eat pie and fight with the AN/I crowd )   

Hey, no fair!  Truthkeeper got a pie and I only got a lousy cupcake? )  Seriously, though (and this goes to both Sadads and Truthkeeper), thank you both for your input on Red Badge.  The problem with such important  and, quite frankly, brilliant  novels like Red Badge and The Sun Also Rises is trying to strike that perfect balance between readability and encyclopedic value.  It's so difficult to get just right, and as a result no two novel-related articles are ever the same.  Perhaps that's why a project like WP:NOVELS will never be sustainable in quite the same way as WikiProjects dedicated to battleships, films, or even fungi.  A few years ago when I tried to resurrect the project, it was unfortunately a waste of time for me, personally; while my interests even then were leaning toward classic literature, it seemed that many members were only occupied with popular literature.  We could never seem to organize ourselves, and it seems that continues today.  That, and I admittedly seem to work better by myself.  I apologize for my shortness with you; I know you meant well, but my high standards clouded that fact.  I'm sorry if this episode may have hastened a wiki-break on your part.  I hope it doesn't keep you away from long, since it's obvious you have your fingers in many Wiki-pies, and you obviously enjoy what you do!  Y",0.0

 Controversy - a litltle balance, maybe? 

I'm fully aware that most of the authors of this articles are pro-Kerry or at least anti-Bush, but should it be quite so obvious to the reader?  

Actually, the main part of the article (while not always completely balanced)has a fair amount of give-and-take, attempting to lay out each side's statements and the other's responses.  It's clear that we have some very different opinions, but we're making some good headway here.

BUT the """"Controversy"""" section is almost entirely attacks from one side(about two dozen sentences), the long list of allegedly significant """"ties"""", and numerous (often angry) quotes from Kerry's team and supporters (including many in the media), many of which add little or no actual information or argument for their position.  On the other side we find a few brief Bush-Cheney denials, and maybe two quotes.  Fine, if you're trying to sound like an LA Times editorial.  But I didn't think that's what we were after here.

(And, of course, there is the insistence that certain responses to charges are not relevant, even if these are the actual responses Bush, et.al. are making.   I didn't think it was our job to judge the strength of each side's argument simply to seek to represent it fairly.)

Could we afford to shorten and limit the number of quotes that add more heat than light?   And is it possible to resist the temptation to insist that every statement that might appear more favorable to Bush or Cheney (there are precious few as it is!) must immediately be countered?""",0.0

Hello again, Tdadamemd. Getting right to your comment about slang, I don't understand your stating that """"fuck"""" is not slang, or your linking to dictionary.com as proof that it is not. The word """"fuck,"""" while vulgar, is also slang; the dictionary.com source you cited even states so. It makes it clear that it can be slang for a variety of things, including sexual intercourse/other sexual activity. It list 13 numbered examples regarding what """"fuck"""" can mean. As for Wiktionary, I don't refer to sources like that. And, yes, I am fine with mentioning """"fuck"""" (or """"fucking"""") and the euphemism """"sleeping together"""" lower in the article, in the the Definitions and stimulation factors section, as alternative words for sexual intercourse/sexual activity. But again, there are a lot of terms for sexual intercourse, most of them slang. That these terms exist doesn't mean that all of them should be in this article. In fact, most times when there are many alternative terms for a word, especially if those terms are slang, we don't include all of them. As you know, this is an encyclopedia and not a dictionary. 

If WP:CONSENSUS is achieved for including your proposal, I'll add it by briefly summarizing that there are various vulgar and/or slang terms and euphemisms for sexual intercourse/other sexual activity...such as """"fuck"""" and """"sleeping together"""" (the wording won't be exactly like that, of course). And, really, because there are so many terms for sexual intercourse, and """"fuck"""" is not especially relevant to the topic of sexual intercourse (by that, I mean that most people and sources are not discussing the word """"fuck"""" when discussing sexual intercourse), that is probably why """"fuck"""" isn't currently in this article. Someone who is aware of your having repeatedly added it to the lead expressed to me via email me that """"fuck"""" is also U.S.-centric; so that's also something to think about, though the term is also used outside of the United States. 

Also, sexual intercourse does not = fuck. It's that fuck = sexual intercourse; in its literal sense anyway, since when people use the term...they are usually using it as profanity. That is also why I told you """"The Fuck article mentions sexual intercourse in its lead because it is especially relevant to the topic. However, the term 'fuck' is not especially relevant to the topic of sexual intercourse."""" 

I cannot see how this article is broken simply because it doesn't currently include """"fuck."""" But, like I stated, I don't mind adding it to the article. I'd rather see what others have to state on that matter first, however.   """,0.2857142857142857

  . I agree with Slrubenstein above. I have long argued that my position, Endler's position (position 1 high up in this discussion page) is a current scientific one and very closely linked with Darwin's.
Excatly, it is A current one. Not THE current one. making that THE definition is WP:NOR.  
  
It confuses because the old definitions are incorrect.  
Kim, I do not see how you can say this unless you agree with Henry Ford that """"history is bunk.""""  Most people are interested in history, and there are even scientists who are interested in the history of their science.  That it confuses you does not mean (as I think is now evident) that it will confuse most readers of this encyclopedia.  They understand that things change.  They also understand that trends have beginnings.  It is simply meaningless to say """"the old definition is incorrect.""""  If you do not understand why, I urge you to read up on the philosophy of science - definitions are more or less useful.  It was that old definition that led to a line of inquiry that has led evolutionary scientists to more precise and more useful understandings of the process.  If anything, as educators we should show readers how scientists start with one formulation of natural selection and then refine it.  
You know, the fact that you reject Darwin's definition of natural selection does not mean natural selection and the theory of evolution are wrong.  On the contrary, it simply means that science has a history, that scientists debate and refine concepts which necessarily change over time.  Do you think this is a trivial point?  In the United States, at least, you are dead wrong.  If you are not from the US let me tell you, there is a huge """"creationist"""" movement which has, on numerous ocassions, had the theory of evolution banned from high schools.  And you should know that one """"argument"""" they make is that Darwin was - well, as you say, """"incorrect.""""  """"See!"""" they exclaim, """"even scientists say Darwin was wrong!  We should no longer teach evolution!""""  Obviously, they misunderstand the way science works.  They do not understand that scientists refine and develop theories without necessarily rejecting them.  I think scientists have an obligation to educate people about this.  Showing how scientists accept an idea, and then change its definition or conceptualization by refining it without repudiating it is the best way to accomplish this.    |  Talk 
You confuse hiding Darwin versus focusses on current usage first and add darwin's definitions in the history section.  
Okay, but with all due respect, you confuse starting with Darwin for focussing on Darwin.  They aren't the same.  There are two reasons for starting with Darwin: one, it is a reasonable starting point, two, whatever differences there are between you, Axel, Marco and others, or among different scientists who have published on natural selection, all can agree that Darwin introduced the idea.  Why not just say @@@Natural selection''', as first introduced by Darwin, refered to ....  Since Darwin, evolutionary scientists have revised his definition based on new findings in genetics and molecular biology...?    |  Talk

It's no secret that I'm not a native english speaker. I'm aware of my limits in handling english language. However I still can't see what would be so """"improper"""" in what I wrote, considering the formulation is exactly what native english speakers could read on a website made by a native english speaker.
Maybe the formulation wasn't clear enough (since someone else corrected it already), but I still don't see it as """"improper"""". This goes back to the difference between a neutral comment on my edits, and a bad-faith attack on my person. I hope you'll remember all this in our future exchanges (because no, I won't """"go away"""" and I predict many more clashes like that).

Concerning the following part of your message...These are things I already talked about weeks ago. Obviously you didn't bother reading what I wrote, and you still haven't read any of the Wikipedia documentation for contributors.
WP is a free and open encyclopedia, that anyone can edit at any time. None of its articles are ever finished, they can always be corrected, or deeply reworked. 
It's not my problem if unappropriate edits were made before I decided to modify the article. There has not been any consensus discussion that had approved your section, but anyway I'll note that even  consensus can change. As you can see, WP is based on flexibility.
And I think I have argued enough, I have explained enough why I considered your section had to be replaced. Honestly, I have not mentionned any personal problem against you or any other questionable motivation, I only remarked that rules had been ignored during the writing of that section, and thus it needed to go.
So, to finish with all that, it is not up to you to decide which article can be edited and which cannot be, or which contributor can edit which article. Because these articles do not belong to you. They belong to Wikipedia, and as I'm a part of Wikipedia, I'm also entitled to modify this article.
You've also the right not to agree with certain edits. In that case, to enforce your opinion, then you need to justify it and to explain what aspect of the rules could prevent a certain edit to be made. However, you do not have the right to prevent edits from being made just because you feel the article belongs to you and that you think your contributions are just perfect and don't need improvement.
You have no right to declare an article closed to further modifications just because you like it the way it is.

What really strikes me in your behavior, is that you actually don't give a damn about the content. Not once since you came to this talk page you bothered to argue about the actual content being discussed, nor tried to show if the rules would allow it. No, what mattered for you was only to find ways to assert your domination on articles. You're not fighting to justify or find qualities in the content, you're just fighting for a right to control articles, to maintain your version as the definite and perfect one, and to prevent people you don't like to touch articles.

This is completely anti-wikipedian. So read No ownership of articles and please stop disrupting WP. If I have to go through a dispute resolution process to make you stop, then I will do it next time you revert me again. 
And as I don't see any content discussion here, I consider this debate finished and I won't waste my time answering your claims of ownership.  """,0.0

 Hahaha 

Check this out:

MickMacNee, an editor with a long history of block for disruptive behaviour [10], seems to have gone out of line in the last days. I don't mind him being defensive of an article he has written the major part about, and several users in the AfD discussion have been very much engaged in it, including myself. However, I object to the repated personal attacks and uncivil behaviour by the editor. His history is rather long, so I provide just a few selected diffs of uncivil comment and direct personal attacks during the last days 11, [12], [13], [14]. In the discussion on this page about a third user, he calls my arguments for not agreeing with him """"""""evasion, obfuscation, interuption and intentional deafness"""". That is rather typical of his attitude in the AfD discussion where he agressively drives that everybody disagreeing with him are wrong. I've tried to point it out to him, [15] but with hindsight (given our infected history) it might have been better not to as I should have predicted how he would respond.[16] However, I'm far from alone in having that opinion. In the last days, several other editors have also commented on his behaviour [17], [18], [19], [20].Jeppiz (talk) 

That block log looks like something out of a Wiki-horror story...why has he not been given long blocks in the past? I would go for a longer-term block. Ks0stm (T•C•G)  
A users block log is not (generally) an excuse to throw the book at him, this looks a bit silly if you ask me, a bit of a tit for tat heated discussion over a article for deletion discussion that is split down the middle, and nothing will come of it, I can't find a really uncivil comment, perhaps if you guys just edit different articles for a few days. Off2riorob (talk)  
It goes without saying that everybody has different opinions, but I do think that """"one of the nastiest and most repugnant editors"""", """"Either your comment was simply ignorant of the facts (like you characterisation of my POV), or you are simply trolling, either way, you are all out of credit here tbh"""", """"I've got no idea what crappy papers you read"""", """"It's up to you if you want to parrot everybody's delete opinion as if it makes you look like you know what you are on about, but it really doesn't."""" are not particularly civil. Neither is """"I have had it with your crap."""". In any case, I won't interact with the user again, I rather leave Wikipedia. As I pointed out, I'm far from alone in having made these observations.Jeppiz (talk)  
Off2riorob, I tried your suggestion, in fact I didn't think I'd need to try, I didn't think I'd cross paths with Mick after this bout of abuse. But sure enough I did, and when I reported him for violation of a 1R measure in place on the Northern Ireland article, half of his defence was an assumption of bad faith against me. I guess if someone keeps an eye on him, he can't get too far out of hand. Alastairward (talk)  
It is a bit of a rant, he is clearly very upset about the footie, and I am sorry you have been upset Jeppiz, he has gone now, probably off to bed, I'm sure one of the admins will have a strong word in his ear when he shows his face again. I myself have had a run in with him but he has grown on me, what can I say. Off2riorob (talk)  
Seeing the diffs Alastairward provided, I cannot agree, even though I see that you stood up for him that time as well. This is a user who seems unable to deal with conflicting views and routinely resorts to personal abuse.Jeppiz (talk)  
Nothing routine about it. Your behaviour and Alistair's are pretty similar, which is why they provoked similar responses eventually. If either of you wish me to lay out the full package of evidence for either of your extraordinarily sustained campaigns of tendentious behaviours, I am only too willing to oblige. MickMacNee (talk)  
First of all, Alistair and I are not the only editors you've attacked and insulted, there are at least Grsz [21] and Kevin McE [22] just in the last few days. 
While I have definitely argued with you, I have not called you one of """"the most repugnant editors"""" [23], called your contributions """"crap"""",[24] called you a """"lying hypocritical cunt"""" [25] or told you to """"fuck off"""" [26], [27]. 
Every time someone brings your behaviour to the attention of administrators, you come up with these vague and unsupported accusations that ones you've argued with have behaved in the same way. It is not a defense (then both should be blocked), and it's not true either, just a dishonest way for you to try to talk you out of it.

Ceremonial pole is a human tradition since ancient times; either existed in past at some point of time, or still exists in some cultures across global continents from north to south & from east to west. Ceremonial poles  are used to symbolize a variety of concepts in several different world cultures. 

Through article Ceremonial pole we intend to take encyclopedic note of cultural aspects and festive celebrations around Ceremonial pole as an umbrella article and want to have historical, mythological, anthropological aspects, reverence or worships wherever concerned as a small part.

While Ceremonial poles have a long past and strong presence but usually less discussed subject. Even before we seek translation of this article in global languages, we need to have more encyclopedic information/input  about Ceremonial poles from all global cultures and languages. And we seek your assistance in the same.

Since other contributors to the article are insisting for reliable sources and Standard native english; If your contributions  get deleted (for some reason like linguistics or may be your information is reliable but unfortunately dosent match expectations of other editors)  , please do list the same on Talk:Ceremonial pole page so that other wikipedians may help improve by interlanguage collaborations, and/or some other language wikipedias may be interested in giving more importance to reliablity of information over other factors on their respective wikipedia.

"THIS ARTICLE SHOULD BE DELETED!!! 

I cannot believe that people are so deluded to think that this guy Richard Kastle deserves a damn wikipedia page. 

Why not give every single person who plays piano a page of their own... HELL, why not let anyone just put up a page about themselves. Not only was he previously featured in a video DAMNING deceased pianists about their playing (accusing them of simplifying the ending octave section of Liszts 2nd Hungarian Rhapsody), but hasn't done anything to deserve any special credit. Apart from his compositions which truly aren't anything brilliant - in fact, they're almost bland and boring (from a compositional point of view), he seems to ride on the credit of having played two compositions brilliant (which seems to be the deluded, sick, biased opinion of a guy called MikeCaffey on YouTube) when in fact his playing is sloppy and usually completely drowned in pedal, completely disturbing the balance of sound in the music. 

Now this deluded, sick individual on YouTube (MikeCaffey) seems to go about praising Dick (short for Richard, and far more funny to refer him to that, than Richard) for his compositions, deleting valid posts by real pianists and piano players alike, possibly in an effort to sweeten the image of Dick to others. As a pianist myself, I can safely say that playing the end of Liszts Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 in c sharp minor brilliantly does not alleviate ones status to piano-god, and even if it did Dick STILL wouldn't be a piano God since he seems intent on drowning the ending with pedal, completely destroying the cleanliness of the parading octaves. 

Letting this slanderous leech of the musical world have a wikipedia page seems insulting to other pianists who truly have talent. Although they may not care whether they have a page or not, I find it insulting to the profession of pianism that Dick has a page of his own.

Neither you nor I are experts in the article subject matter (least squares spectral analysis).

"Request to Unblock
I began writing the following statement (excepting its two postscripts) before I was blocked. I suspect that User: AuburnPilot had me blocked, in order to prevent me from complaining to administrators about his misconduct. Although I was directed to request an unblock of User: Physicq210, who had blocked me, requesting such of the latter would require that I censor myself, and write as though User: Physicq210 had acted in good faith, and was one of the good guys. That would be surreal, and would give User: Physicq210 a moral legitimacy belied by his actions. And so, the following request for unblocking is directed at any administrator BUT User: Physicq210, but since I’m not a devious sort, I have nothing against the latter reading this. Indeed, I want User: Physicq210 to read it. For if I can be banned from Wikipedia for standing up to censors, then it is vastly preferable to go down fighting, than to go down the long dark road of self-abnegation and self-censorship, including the use of bad English. After all, if I wanted to be a lackey, I could go to graduate school.

WIKI Administrators’ Notice Board Incidents
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents

User: AuburnPilot

A few days ago, User: AuburnPilot began stalking me, checking wherever I had made edits, and going to the articles in question and vandalizing them. He or she has been manipulating Wikipedia rules as cover for what is clearly political censorship. User: AuburnPilot cannot even stand for Wikipedia readers to find out about factual material that upsets his political applecart through footnotes. Zero tolerance!

He claims of any source he politically dislikes, that it is either “spam” or a “blog” (or “POV,” another favorite dodge for those at Wikipedia seeking to censor those who fail to conform to their own POV), even though the one source is a previously published, classic magazine article otherwise unavailable on the Web (http://geocities.com/nstix/waronpolice.html), which the author has seen fit to publish on his Web site, and the other source is the longest, most thorough exposé yet published on the Duke rape hoax (http://vdare.com/stix/070113_duke.htm).

Note that I am not even talking about censoring writing within articles, since I hadn’t done any writing on the articles in question: Crystal Gail Mangum, Michael Nifong, 2006 Duke University lacrosse team scandal and Racial profiling.
I’ve been involved in edit wars before, though I have never been the aggressor, and have never initiated an elective edit war, though given the self-assurance that aggressors such as User: AuburnPilot exude, perhaps I ought to reconsider that position. It seems that aggressors rule here.

The reason I am making a formal complaint is that User: AuburnPilot has tonight upped the ante, threatening to have me banned
(http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:70.23.199.239&redirect;=no), if I do not surrender to his censorship. Should you find for me, please serve this individual with the wikiquivalent of a cease-and-desist order. Should you, however, find for the censor, please provide an Index of banned publications and a list of official wikicensors.

P.S. January 19, 2007 115A EST. Since beginning this complaint, I see that User: AuburnPilot has in fact succeeded at getting a crony, User: Physicq210, to block me, thus not only getting administrative support in censoring me, but preventing me from responding to his thuggery. (And no, I am not going to use cutesy, euphemistic language. If I were into such deception, I would have become a liar, er, lawyer, and would be worthless as an encyclopedist.) And I was unable to e-mail User: Physicq210 because I am not logged in and “You must be logged in and have a valid authenticated e-mail address in your preferences to send e-mail to other users.” (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Emailuser/Physicq210)

If this isn’t cyber-Stalinism, I don’t know what is! So, let me get this straight. Stalking and censoring an editor while using the equivalent of smiley faces (User: AuburnPilot’s penchant for saying “Thank you” after vandalizing one’s links) is “civil,” but complaining about such abuse counts as “spam, disruption, incivility, and personal attacks.” If that is verily so, then 2 + 2 = 5.

P.P.S The message here says that I was “temporarily blocked from editing Wikipedia as a result of your disruptive edits.” What the heck is that supposed to mean? For restoring footnotes and links that User: AuburnPilot had vandalized? If that constitutes “disruptive edits,” then you’ve utterly given up on honest English and all human decency. Sorry, but I don’t have any sympathy for the Devil.",0.14285714285714285

On UF's TD, the receiver's rear end looked like it was down on the ground.  They showed us 4 angles and paused it with the ball breaking the plane and still in his hand.  Ok, fine, I believe you, it's not a fumble, but how about pausing it where his rear end hits the ground and seeing if the ball is over the line yet.

Also, that statement reminds me of when the slaveowners back in the Southern part of America during the civil war used to consider Blacks getting education as a threat to their lifestyle. As a matter of fact, it was illegal for an Afro-American to go to school or even learn to read, since it was viewed as a threat to the racist slave owners. I will even go a further step to say that back then, these racists from the colonial South felt threatened that the slaves would become """"a very powerful and scary radicalized community"""".

 Seth Material 

Oasis, thank you for the supportive comments that you made on the Seth Material talk page recently.

If you are truly a new editor, there are some things you need to know.  Wikipedia's rules governing editing and the behavior of editors are very poorly written.  They encourage people who have nothing else to do to spend hours and hours on the site each day.  However, once an editor has exhausted his knowledge, any contributions he makes after that are of dubious value.  The result is that there are contingents of what I call """"Wiki-addicts"""" who make little positive contribution to the encyclopedia, but who make a lot of trouble for other editors.  They generally call themselves """"skeptics"""", and they spend hours each day attacking articles they don't like.  They fancy themselves to be guardians of neutrality, but their edits are rarely neutral.  They also fancy themselves to be Wikipedia experts, and consequently they are rarely willing to collaborate.  Generally, they are atheists, right-wing Christians and political conservatives, and they attack articles on topics that are not in the mainstream, especially in the area of religion.  The Seth Material article has suffered from such attacks since it was created a couple years ago.  Recently, several """"skeptics"""" ganged up on me and got me kicked off the article.  The editors who are now in control of it have no knowledge of the Seth Material whatsoever, beyond the fact that they don't like it, so the article is now controlled by editors who would prefer to delete the article altogether.  They have already cut out portions of it.  If you want to see the most complete version of the article, look for the version edited by """"Itsmejudith"""".  You'll find text in there that has since been deleted.

Basically, my message to you is that Wikipedia is a hostile environment, especially if you are interested in topics of religion or spirituality.  If you have things to say in those areas, it is best to do it on your own web site.  With so many editors on Wikipedia intent on censoring information they don't like, it is very hard to make contributions in those areas without getting into non-stop edit-wars.  """,0.0

This award is given to User:Gilabrand in recognition of all your imaginative and original photographs related to topics about Israel and Judaism, as can be seen on your user page. In particular, I was impressed by how many of these photographs enhance so many articles about people, places and things in Israel. Mazal Tov and may you be blessed to continue contributing to Wikipedia in this productive fashion for a long time to come. See Wikipedia:Barnstars: """"The da Vinci Barnstar may be awarded to anyone who has enhanced Wikipedia through their technical work..."""" and you most certainly deserve it. Sincerely, IZAK (talk)  

Thank you, Izak, for that very heartwarming award. That someone has noticed my contributions and sees them as noteworthy makes all the hard work worthwhile.Gilabrand (talk)  
Hi Gila: Yes, you make beautiful art and I appreciate it as I am sure many others do. Best wishes, IZAK (talk)

[edit] Armenian Genocide
Peres' denial of the genocide should be noted in this article, failing to do so makes it more of a hagiography than a biography. His shortcomings must also be mentioned in addition to his feats like winning the noble prize. Do you think it'd fit better in political views? In anycase it must, and will, be mentioned somewhere. How about adding this in his political views segment:

Peres' foreign policy outlook is markedly realist. For example, to placate Turkey, the only significant Muslim country in the region that is friendly towards Israel, Peres has explicity denied the Armenian genocide, which caused an uproar among genocide scholars.(citation) E10ddie (talk) 

Peres made these statements in 2001, when he was foreign minister. Clearly, he was caving in to Turkish pressure. Israel has very few friends and cannot afford to lose them, so basically it is not free to take the position that would seem to mesh with its outlook and history, which is to recognize that the Armenians were murdered en mass. Now he is president, an honorary position, not a political one, and his """"views,"""" whatever they may have been back then, are worth about as much as mine are. I have no problem with mentioning this """"view"""" in the section on his political outlook, but a separate section on this one utterance gives it undue importance and distorts the picture. Gilabrand (talk)  

[edit] sumac opening sentence
I don't know what the right wording is, but do you see the problem with """"Sumac (also Rhus) is a genus of approximately 250 species of flowering plants in the family Anacardiaceae""""? First of all, there is no reason to italicize Sumac. Secondly, it is not accurate to say """"Sumac is a genus"""" because there is no genus called Sumac (but there is one called Rhus).

I may be too steeped in botanical jargon to easily come up with something which is natural to non-plant-people. But we need to figure out something which (a) works whether people get to this page as Sumac or Rhus (currently, the latter is a redirect to the former; policy would have it the other way around), and (b) doesn't mix up scientific names versus common names in a confusing way. Kingdon (talk) 

I am not a botanist and my reason for reading the article was because of the spice, which is used all over the Middle East. I was surprised that the spice didn't rate a mention in the lead. Sumac needs to be the first word in keeping with Wikipedia norms, and the same as the title of the article (i.e., not plural). How about: """"Sumac refers to a variety of shrubs or small trees of the genus Rhus, as well as the purplish spice that is produced from its dried, crushed berries Gilabrand (talk)  
Looks like Richard New Forest (talk · contribs) has solved it for us (I'm happy with his wording). As for """"first word"""", Wikipedia policy isn't quite that strict (""""earliest natural point in the prose"""" at Wikipedia:Lead section#Bold title and I don't know whether a plural fits under """"slightly different form"""" or not).

"""The-Pope]]====
By stating """"Comments about the opinions and supposed motivations of other editor will be removed"""" you are completely missing the point. We have some people in the Australian community (both on and of wiki) who only call the round ball game football (or maybe association football) and get offended/upset/angry by the word soccer due to previous negative connotations of the word. Others use the word football exclusively for another code, most commonly Australian rules football, and only use soccer (without any intended offence) for the round ball game. Then you have another group who are happy to use either term, depending on context or to avoid any possible ambiguity. What proportion of the population is in each group depends on location, age, era, ethnicity/cultural background, etc. So there is no single consensus.  I'm for soccer if it avoids confusion of codes (such as a in a multi-sport stadium article or a suburb article), but using football is ok if a dedicated article (such as a team or player article), all with a piped link to association football (a term which is rarely used and can also be ambiguous in parts Australia with Australian rules football games played in competitions named Associations such as the Victorian Football Association). Extrapolating the no move decision in that RM about a single parent article to apply to every mention of the sport is invalid, in my opinion. Achieving a true consensus is near impossible because we aren't a homogenous society.

Also it would have to be paired with fact that the specimen (almost exclusively associated with Y-DNA R1a1) from South Siberia and Kazakhstan (*) had almost exclusively mtDNA haplogroups of west eurasian/european origin especially during bronze age (as far as 1,800 BC).

( http://www.springerlink.com/content/4462755368m322k8/ ), that's meaningful and favors an European origin of these R1a1. 
Especially since no south Asian haplogroups are linked to the spread of R1a1, up to Europe.

Pretty meaningful, especially since such phenotypes are found where high frequency of R1a1 are found in Asia (like

 Re Andrew Skolnick's Cerebral Meltdown 

 If everyone is onboard, please use the text/link to MMY's Bhagavad-Gita that I several weeks ago created and inserted into the MMY article (it didn't have one).
 By the same token, feel free to do the same with any other book Maharishi Mahesh Yogihas written, including """"Love and God."""" 
 The mantra section was dropped because it was infactual (Andrew Skolnick does not know what he is talking about). 
 Was not aware of any comments re TM-teacher defectors in the TM article. A good place for a one-liner about this would be the seciton under Criticsim and Controversies dealing with internal criticism - incidentally another created by myself (to the apparent dismay of anti-TMers, who allege TM-practitioners can't think for themselves).
The allegations about the TM Movement being sexistis is so stupid I considered it an act of mercy toward A Skolnick and his merry band of morons to remove it. If the intelligent reader wishes to re-live the hilariousness ofit - just check the history and learn how the Askolnicks of this world brandishes entire organizations after single individual males at some time allegedly addresses a woman by her first name(!) 

Walking on ice that thin - I am surprised Askolnick haven't drowned and reached the bottom a long time ago.

Also when it comes to allegations about lack of intellectual freedom and zero-tolerance, it is evident that Askolnick does not speak from any type of experience of TM, the TM Movement or its founder - in short Andrew Skolnick is utterly unqualified to offer any enlightening comments on this subject what so ever. 

In fact,reading his edits, it appears the guy forms his opinions by visiting various TM-critical websites whilst under the influence of controlled substances.

Let's just hope A Skolnick's next enterprice is not to """"improve"""" the wikipedia article on Einstein and his science.

As regards the rest of Askolnick's conspiracy theories I consider it my second act of mercy toward the man not to offer any comments.

 Why confusion and controversy in the """"real world"""" does not preclude the writing of a good Wikipedia on the topic 

Ackoz suggests that, because the real world has not yet hashed out """"the truth"""" about the expulsions, it is therefore impossible for us to know the truth and thus impossible for us to write about it.

I reject such a stance.  I think it is difficult but quite possible to write a quality Wikipedia article about a topic that is murky and/or controversial.  Where many Wikipedia editors """"get it wrong"""" is that they believe Wikipedia's job is to report the truth.  This is wrong.  Wikipedia's job is not to report the truth precisely because it is difficult to determine what the truth is.  Any attempt to do that is original research.

Instead of """"truth"""", Wikipedia aims for """"verifiability"""".  Put a different way, Wikipedia is committed to recording the state of human knowledge and opinion (not our opinions but those of reliable sources).  If the truth is clear and uncontroversial, it is easy for us to report that.  If the truth is murky and controversial, it is more challenging but possible for us to report on what different reliable sources assert and think about a topic EVEN if these reliable sources conflict.  Where Wikipedia editors get into trouble is when they start siding with one side of a controversy and asserting that the side that they have selected represents """"THE TRUTH"""" and not just one perspective (or POV) on the topic at hand.

I have been trying to hit this NPOV """"sweet spot"""" but it is difficult to do so in the midst of a running polemical debate between the two sides.

 
Obviously is, because some users (Jadger and Wikiferdi) don't want to discuss in fact, they want us to agree with their POV, that's not discussion about the NPOV edits. That's why I quit from the discussion about the form of the article. ≈talk≈ """,0.0

The problem with that argument is that it assumes your presence will help to build an encyclopedia, and there are quite a few people who feel your past behavior has hindered the building of it, wasted their time, or will be a distraction to them and others on here if you are back.

The simple answer is...
Mostly Southern (call it 80/20), but with some Midwestern traits. 
For example, Kentucky's hilly topography with many streams and rivers are typical of the South, but the """"United We Stand Divided We Fall"""" motto is totally opposite of most """"State's rights"""" mottos in the South.  Economically we area somewhere in between, having a better economy and population growth than most Midwestern states, but still behind true sunbelt states like Georgia, Tennessee or the Carolinas. Food and accent wise we are definatly southern.

As For Louisville,I think that the """"old stock"""" native Louisvillians are  midwestern in accent and attitude, but Jefferson's County nearly doubled it's population from 1940-1960 with people mostly from south central and western Kentucky which really altered the culture.

Managing the content of articles when a plant product (whether food or other) is not in a 1:1 relationship with botanical taxa is always a problem. Here it seems clear that a separate article on the plant product is the right approach; there's bound to be some overlap with genus/species articles. This article seems to me about right in its focus on what English-speakers normally mean by """"banana"""", namely the food, where it comes from, what it is, how it's grown, etc. It would be possible to move some the taxonomy material to Musa (genus) perhaps, with some cross-referencing, so that the article concentrates more on the food and agricultural aspects of the topic, but this would be a marginal change.

Thanks!
for the *. NawlinWiki (talk) 

My pleasure. I think I have to apologize for subjecting you to the diatribe it engendered but, as I think you might agree, it tends to prove the point in an ironic way. I just looked at your talk page and decided that the minor whining *I* get from new page patrol is relatively polite compared to what you seem to have attracted  hence the *. Accounting4Taste:talk  
NalinWiki, you deleted my article while I was still writing it on the basis that it contained """"no references whatsoever"""" but allow your own article to stand even though it contains """"no references whatsoever"""". Please, please explain how your point been proven in """"an ironic way"""". Go ahead. Explain it. All I have seen so far from you is reckless deletion of other people`s work followed by pathetic back-slapping from like-minded wreckers. If you are going to have a dig at me, why not do it on my own talk page? You weren`t shy to destroy four hours of my work, so why be shy now? Kont Dracula (talk) 

I think you've confused the two of us; I must take credit for some statements that have apparently offended you, having signed them, so feel free to express yourself here about them. If you want the contents of an article that was deleted, in order to work on adding citations in a """"sandbox"""" page, you can either ask me or another administrator for assistance. If you have any other questions about Wikipedia policies, I'll be happy to direct you to the relevant pages. And if you'd like to work on contributing to Wikipedia in a worthwhile way, in accordance with our policies, I think everyone here will try to assist you. Accounting4Taste:talk  
No, I haven`t confused anything. There is not very much to confuse between you two drones anyway. I see that you are not very good at answering specific questions about specific articles. Evidently, you feel much safer describing deleted articles that you have not even read as """"steaming crap"""" than you are actually discussing the actual merits of said articles. A really positive, worthwhile contribution there. Is that the kind of """"contribution"""" you want me to make? Hardly surprising that you prefer the classic politburo repsonse of """"directing me to the relevant"""" regulations rather than discuss the merits of the case in question. Yet you have the arch hypocrisy to highlight the """"assume good faith"""" legend on your page.

Well I do have some questions about wikipedia policy, as you mention it:

1) Is it an acceptable practice for a wikipedia adminstrator to delete articles which are in the very process of being written without consultation or clarification on the basis that they do not contain references when the very same administrator has himself posted less relevant articles which do not contain references himself?

2) If the answer to the above is yes (and I have to conclude that it is, as that is precisely what has happened) would it be fair to conclude that wikipedia administrators feel themselves above and not subject to the same criteria for notability and verification as non-administrators? After all, my article contained no references and was deleted. NawlinWiki`s contained no references and was amended when I pointed it out. Please refer me to the relevant pages. Kont Dracula (talk) 

1. Yes, to the first part of the question; administrators can delete articles without consultation or clarification. Articles that are being considered for deletion are assessed entirely on their own terms, and not with reference to any other article, so comparison of your article (which I have read) with any article created or edited by anyone else is not a relevant consideration. You can read the relevant policy at WP:WAX. 
Well I didn`t expect you to be so candid about it. So you believe that it is entirely acceptable for an administrator to completely ignore the very regulations that he is so dogmatically enforcing onto others. You still haven`t referred me to the """"relevant"""" page on that one.

But no, you have not """"read"""" my article because it was in the very process of being written when it was deleted. I am sure that there was a great deal of improvement that it required. There were some slightly whimiscial and humourous details which were possibly not appropriate for a wikipedia entry. It wasn`t perfect. You see, that is why I was editing it and indeed still writing it.

Of course, in reality we know that you have not actually expressed your own opinion. You were pretty forward with your opinion the other day though, weren`t you? You described other people`s articles as """"steaming shit"""". Now though, you are not quite so forward with your opinion. Instead, you try to retreat behind """"guidelines"""" """"r",0.0

 Some  Wikipedia  """"Contributors"""" giving the Dictator Jose Eduardo dos Santos an Engineer Degree in Petroleum 

This section is taken out from the propaganda web page of the MPLA Peoples Party (Communist Party).
Looking at the dates there is no chance that Mr. Jose Eduardo dos Santos could have gone to Russia for a Oil Engineer Degree. Also the MPLA official web page does not mentions any such degree as well. Taking into consideration that this would be considered a major achievement it seems odd to say the least that the MPLA Comrades Totalitarian Party have """"forgotten"""" to mention this intellectual and academic achievement of their murderous and deep ignorant leader.

But in wikipedia from (night to day) """"voila"""" Mr. Jose Eduardo dos Santos (a son of a Sao Tome brick layer) could not have gone to Russia or Timbuktu for a degree, as it was economical impossible to him to afford such studies. 

People in Angola who are still alive knew personally this communist and murderous pig, as having only two shirts and only a couple of suits, how could this criminal afford to go to Russia for his Engineer degree, and if he had been there and made his degree (3 to 4 years minimum) then there is no time in the description of his activities and exiled years in Congo Brazzaville.

From the MPLA Web Site: """"Após a eclosão da luta contra a ocupação colonial, em 4 de Fevereiro de 1961, José Eduardo dos Santos, então com 19 anos, abandonou em Novembro desse mesmo ano o país e passou a coordenar no exterior a actividade da Juventude do MPLA(organismo de que é um dos fundadores). Integrou em 1962 o EPLA (Exército Popular de Libertação de Angola), participando na preparação das condições para a abertura da 2ª Região Político-Militar. Em 1963 foi o primeiro representante do MPLA em Brazzaville/ Congo. Nesse mesmo país, depois de terminados os seus estudos superiores, frequentou durante um ano um curso Militar de Telecomunicações, que o habilitou a exercer, de 1970 a 1974, sucessivamente as funções de Operador do Centro Principal de Comunicações da Frente Norte e Responsável-adjunto dos Serviços de Telecomunicações na 2ª Região Político-Militar do MPLA (Cabinda). Em 1974, José Eduardo dos Santos é designado membro da Comissão Provisória de Reajustamento da Frente Norte, responsável das Finanças da 2ª Região, e desempenha novamente as funções de Representante do MPLA em Brazzaville, até Junho de 1975.""""

So lets hope that common sense sinks in, and that we can see what is obvious, and lets not allow the good nature on which the Wikipedia project was founded and based to be a place where totalitarian communist regimes use this space and wikipedia inadvertently is perceived as a tool to validate their Regimes, we therefore as freemen and humans, we must not allow this space to be used with the aim to prize this (or other) criminal murderous Communist Dictator.

 [Aftermath note 1]: I created this topic when I was concerned there might be an serious (emergency) situation, but did not have sufficient knowledge of the editor's history (especially recent onwiki conversations) to judge how serious the matter was — but I had just observed behavior which was sufficiently out of the norm to not simply dismiss the replacement/message on their user page.  (interact)  

 [Aftermath note 2.a]: I  may be incorrect, but I do not believe Equazcion had sufficient knowledge of the history of the administrator to simply dismiss the matter. Unfortunately, there may be more to discuss about the interaction above, but let us first clarify if I am correct or incorrect with regard to Equazcion's knowledge of the administrator history (especially recent communications/interactions).  (interact)  

[Aftermath note 2.b]: In the interaction above Equazcion has characterized my interaction with the administrator (on User talk: Jimbo Wales) prior to the administrator's user page replacement message. Before we discuss this further, perhaps Equazcion may wish to reconsider the characterizations.  (interact)  

(I will immediately notify Equazcion of the notes 2.a and 2.b above so they may comment.  (interact)  )

===Question(s) for administrators regarding the user talk message===
The big question, of course, do we need to follow up regarding this?
 Clearly an administrator replacing their user page (and especially leaving it that way for 12 hours) with that is an inappropriate reaction to any situation. 
Note that the administrator's edits just prior to their user page replacement were:
 User talk: Jimbo Wales Revision as of 02:27, 14 February 2010 Rodhullandemu (→Bloqued WHY?: reply, and fuck you.)
 User talk: Jimbo Wales Revision as of 02:34, 14 February 2010 Rodhullandemu (→Bloqued WHY?: I'm gone.)
 User talk: Jimbo Wales Revision as of 02:41, 14 February 2010 Rodhullandemu (→Bloqued WHY?: goodbye)
Now, what is all that the reaction to? (Hint: A mock and a """"hear hear"""")
 Revision as of 02:15, 14 February 2010 Proofreader77 (→Bloqued WHY?: (edit conflict) Retort to Rodhullandemu  who clearly has too many stars on their veteran editors medal ^;^ (Note: Python logic chip activated for Valentine's day drama)
 Revision as of 02:37, 14 February 2010 Proofreader77 (→Bloqued WHY?: (edit conflict) Hear hear! to Rodhullandemu's 4-star reply to that one-starred nitwit Proofreader77 ... although by a technicality only 3 are allowed. ^;^)
Executive summary (light version)
That (dastardly!) Proofreader77 mocked an administrator to virtual death with one silly message and a follow-up """"Hear Hear."""" — should any administrator who can be mocked to virtual death so easily retain the bit? -)  (interact)

 Hypocritical editing by han/chinese user on East Turkestan Islamic Movement. 

Hello MS good day to you. Please take a look at the page.

The US had put them in the list of terrorist-organizations for a brief while before they removed the ETIM. More glaringly, he even lists the Central Asian countries including Afghanistan as """"opponents"""" of ETIM when in reality it is a problem for purely the han/chinese. As to whether it is an occupied nation like Tibet and Inner-Mongolia or not is besides the point. But these articles being passed off as references have NOTHING to do with the ETIM.

 Éamonn McCann on RSF and Political Legacy of 1916 

ÉRSF 'AUTHENTIC CLAIMANTS TO POLITICAL LEGACY OF 1916 RISING' 

WRITING in the Sunday edition of the Derry Journal journalist and author Éamonn McCann said that in his view, as far as Republicanism was concerned, the most authentic claimants to the political legacy of the 1916 Rising were Ruairí Ó Brádaigh and Republican Sinn Féin. 

He said: """"The Proclamation didn't promise a fight to achieve the Republic. It proclaimed the Republic as an actually-existing entity. It is for this reason that IRA volunteers ever since have pledged not to strive for the achievement of the Republic but to defend the Republic already achieved. In this perspective, a deal which others might see as a step towards the ultimate objective will be seen as contemptible retreat from the struggle. 

""""In detaching himself from the Provisionals in 1986 because they'd accepted the legitimacy of the Leinster House parliament, Ó Brádaigh stood by the Republic established on Easter Monday. Looked at from this angle - as legitimate an angle as any other - there is no question: Mr Ó Brádaigh and his followers stand alone in true succession to Easter Week. 

""""Those of us who stand rights outside the Republican tradition and who take a socialist view also see Easter Week in the perspective of our own politics, see its enduring legacy in the fact that it was a blow against the most powerful Empire on earth at the time, and regard it as self-evident that its spirit is best represented today in the fight against the imperial power of the US ruling class. 

""""In this view, the most egregious betrayal of 1916 lies not in grudgingly taking seats in a partitionist parliament but in cheerfully breaking bread with George W Bush."""" 

The Sunday Journal also carried an article entitled """"We're the true inheritors of 1916""""' - Derry Republican Sinn Féin"""" on page 4. 

""""Plans by the Irish Government to celebrate the 1916 Easter Rising are hypocritical, a Derry Republican Sinn Féin (RSF) activist has suggested. 

Derry based spokesman for the movement, Richard Walsh says that RSF are the only true inheritors of the historic insurrection and the proclamation of independence. He hit out at the 26-County Administration for """"war-crimes"""" against those who believed in the ideals of the uprising during the Civil War. 

He said: """"There has been much talk of late about the legacy of the Easter Rising of 1916. 

""""Bertie Ahern has announced plans by the 26-County State to commemorate 1916 with a Free State military parade. 

""""Let no-one forget that it was the Free State Army that executed four Republican soldiers in Co. Donegal by firing squad in 1923 as a reprisal for Republican military operations. True Republicans commemorate the Drumboe Martyrs at Eastertide every year. 

""""The Staters were also responsible for many other war-crimes such as the Ballyseedy massacre in Co. Kerry (also in March, 1923), where eight Republican soldiers were killed whilst strapped to a landmine by Free State forces - miraculously leaving one survivor."""" 

He added that the 26-County government cannot claim ownership to the legacy of the Easter Rising. 

""""Those who not only betrayed the All-Ireland Republic - proclaimed in arms at Easter 1916, endorsed by the people of Ireland in 1918, and effectively established by Dáil Éireann in January, 1919 - but also actively waged war against it cannot claim the legacy of 1916. 

""""These people continue to imprison Republicans by using the Special non-jury Court in Dublin - the same building in which Robert Emmet was sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered by the English - on the basis of the opinion of the 26-County police [Gardaí]."""" 

He added that the Republican Movement, on the other hand, had """"remained loyal to the Republic of Clarke; Mac Diarmada; Mac Donagh; Pearse; Ceannt; Connolly and Plunkett, and have commemorated the 1916 Rising every year since.

{{unblock|DISCLAIMER: I do not identify as a Nazi, Neo-Nazi, Facist, Neo-Fascist. I do not accept or agree with the actions or views of Hitler or any other dictators in the world for that matter. I do not hate Jews... in fact I have many jewish friends...
Hello, although this is technically an unblock appeal, it is really only a reason to explain.... you won't be in a mood to unblock me when I'm finished talking... )
First of all I want to apologise, I should have thought before putting the giant swastika on my page. This is the reason for that... I have a few Jewish friends, and normally we sometimes make jokes about jews and christians and things like that. I never really make jokes about the holocaust, because that never go over well with them and it is not nice... well, apparently, a joke about jews being lawyers set one of my closest friends off who is not really a jew, but claims he is.... now he thinks I am a facist, nazi, and I hate jews.... i gotreally frustrated and annoyed and so I came home and started messing around on my userpage... Second of all, i would like to ask why it is not permissable to """"self identify as a nazi""""? There are several userboxes dealing with this subject. There is even a userbox that states, """"This user identifies as a Hitlerist! WHAT THE HELL?!?!?! You will let people say they support Hitler, but you won't let them say they are nazis?!? Being a nazi does not mean that you condone Hitler or his actions, it simple means that you support the theory of the politics behind Nazism.... you can be a nazi and not support the horrible eugenics policy. But if you are hitlerist, that obviously says you support all that... your arguement would of course be that it is offensive to jews.... well if you are taking that into account, then you should also ban anyone that says they identify as a communist. That can be extremely offensive to christians... if you want me to, I can talk about all the horrible things they did to christians in communist russia (with reference of a nice book). I think I will... one of the things they did was putting shackles on the ankles and wrists of christians with spikes of the inside that cut into your skin if you moved at all... and then they put starved rats into your cell that tried to eat you alive so you had to fight them off while your wrists and ankles are killing you. They also tied you to a cross and hung you upside down over a huge pile of other prisoners crammed into a small room. You were then forced to excrete over everyone. You were also stood upright in a box while they drove long nails into it. It was alright if you stood perfectly still, but you would have to stand there for hours and then your body would sway and poke into the nails. They also stood you naked in a freezer with a doctor nearby that signalled when you were freezing to death and then they would take you out and warm you up. They would do that for hours on end. Then they would beat you over and over again asking you to renounce Christ... the holocaust was horrible, but I would rather be gassed or hung by a nazi than endure those tortures for 18 years like one man who wrote a book about his experiences... so could you ban all communists please? 
My last comment is in response to Chzz's question about me making the 'gay comment' statement. Nowadays the word gay is used for two meanings... one is homosexuality and the other is wierd, stupid, dumb... i was using the second connotation.... maybe if you people didn't spend so much time on this gay... sorry... stupid online encyclopedia you would realize how the real world uses words...
Even if you unblock me (which you won't... )...) I will take a wikibreak... i don't want to become addicted to point of ruining my social life...... i have already recieved a punishment, never becoming an admin (the whole gay... sorry... dumb trust thing)... just know this... i would have enventually removed the swastika after I cooled down and because of your gay... sorry... dumb policy you have lost a serious editor... this whole thing has really annoyed me...

 Re: Tracker (business software) 

Hello, thanks for your comments on my talk page.  You mention that the article was """"already reviewed by admins and approved for inclusion in Wikipedia"""".  I tried to make clear the purpose of my edit in the edit summary, but I guess I didn't do a good enough job.  I read through the AFD, the DRV, and the past deletions to get an idea of what was going on.  AFD/DRV were able to determine the notability of the article, but you hit it right on in your comment to me that in it's past state the article wasn't much more than a product sheet, which to me is synonymous with advertising.  Wikipedia articles aren't about features lists or product offerings, they are about bringing together neutral, third-party-verified information about topics.  As I'm sure you've seen I rearranged the page a little more since.  I have no problem with the screenshots or product names & descriptions, so I tried several things which display that information in a little bit more standard Wikipedia.  (Also, this is minor, but Wikipedia admins are no different in terms of article approval than any other editor. I am also an admin, but that just gives me the ability to work on more technical aspects of the project).

You are welcome to expand on the article as it is now, but it would be preferable to do it by gathering information from the many third-party sources listed.  The article is very well sourced, but not very much of that information is brought into the article.

As for the List of project management software, with such a relatively short list, it is inappropiate to have several links to the same family of products.  I don't know a way would satisfy your concern, other than to suggest to put the link in the best place you see fit. In the future, it might be worthwhile listing separately the desktop and the web-based products, but not while there is only enough information for one article.  Again, please remember the primary focus of Wikipedia (see What Wikipedia is not), which is to bring neutral information, not advertising or promoting.    """,0.0

Conflation of the two """"brook"""" homonyms

that crosses between two other bodies of water. This may be US usage but it certainly is not of the UK. (thus """"brooking"""" them) The stream brook derives from Anglo-Saxon broc. The acceptance verb derives from AS brucan. There seems to be little connection. Also the Scottish term for a creek. It is not particularly Scottish. And has to do with creek only in the US usage. ( 08:43, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC))

 RJP was correct that the two brook homonyms were being conflated.  AHD4 says that brook the transitive verb (""""To put up with; tolerate"""") comes from Middle English brouken, from Old English brūcan, """"to use, enjoy"""". (BTW, that's interesting, because today's German verb brauchen can mean """"to use"""". Clearly cognate.)

 Meanwhile, brook the noun (""""stream"""") is a homonymous word coming from a different root, via Middle English, from Old English brōc.

  

Section was missing

is part of the article missing?  the last section is empty.  
thalweg says """"see below"""" but there is nothing there. [alex]

Changes to the article
I propose that the """"Types of water streams"""" section be changed. I have been unable to corroborate the brook definition given. The definition I found most often is a stream smaller in size than a creek. It is also used when the water source is a spring or seep. When """"stream"""" is not used in the generic sense, I've found various definitions. Some have it as being the smallest of all and some have it as just below a river. I guess we can continue only giving the generic definition.   

Better image was wanted

I feel that the first image, of a """"running stream,"""" is not very accurate, given we see water still enough for duckweed to accumulate in large amounts.  I don't doubt that it could be a flowing system, but it is hardly what I picture when I close my eyes and think """"running stream.""""  Nitpicky, yes.  

Looking at the current version of the article, this appears to have been fixed.  

 Categories suggestions 
Suggestion:  Make a category about Daylighting (streams) for neighborhoods (plese see article also—the list is already getting long), sections # Some neighborhoods with daylighting projects and # Other places.  A child article or something will eventually need be spun off.

Since each daylighted stream exists only as an intimate component of the neighborhoods of the watershed, linking the streams and neighborhoods in a category could be very useful.  Various daylighting projects exist all over the world, though so far we have Seattle, San Francisco, and Berkeley.  There exist similar projects restoring natural areas in urban settings, distinct from parks.  One is Union Bay Natural Area, another is a marsh north of San Francisco or in northern California (Eureka?) that is also providing habitat and tertiary sewage treatment, rather than having been drained.  (The most-recognized level is conventional secondary treatment.)

Suggestion:  Make a category of natural areas in urban settings.  This is tangentially related to the Georgia Basin Ecosystem Initiative at Salish Sea.

Comments, discussion?  How to tie into existing, relevant articles?

The Daylighting (streams) article could use more diverse examples

 

Stream is limited to Southern England?
I'm sorry, but the quote 'Stream is limited to Southern England,' in reference to the word 'stream' itself is total nonsense.Only the broadest of Yorkshiremen, for example, use only the word 'beck.' I am not adversed to words like these being mentioned in the stream article, but can people please try to avoid making such sweeping statements about them?  

Beck was one used in London as in Tooting bec near Wandsworth and a few Burns in Scotland are also officaly known as Streems or Brooks.  86.29.241.101

The implication I draw from earlier comments is that what Irvine says is not true (unless he's admitting he lied) and everyone else is truthful. Yet even a cursory glance through the comments accompanying the article and associated material in the same publication indicates one of the other major parties involved has a pretty dicey history herself.

 What 

The fuck is going on here................ I don't even know if I should bother trying to fix this or just use my second account permanently. Shit, Indrian and Times probably playing some shit game here pretending to act like me and got all this shit on my page. I knew there was something wrong with those assholes when i saw them the first time. Guess I'll have to abandon this account. Hey  you still need to learn how to read links! Don't think I forgot! This isn't funny asshole! Guess what? I have been using another account and you don't even know what it is since the very first time I was blocked! Ha, keep playing your games, you aren't preventing me from editing piece of shit. Oh and  don't think I forgot about your 5 year old temper issues when anyone tries and fixes issues with your precious Dreamcast punk ass bitch. Lol, you guys did a number on this account. Probably found out what program I was using for the first BS account you made. 

I am impressed with how much damage you have done to this account, but it really means nothing when I am still editing every day on my personal internet and you have no idea which account it is. Oh and no it's not using a proxy or a public wifi spot. Heck, I may even try reporting this, all you idiots did was use proxy's, if I post on this account on my personal connection, and THEN appeal this I might just get my account back and get you idiots banned. I know exactly what you are going to do after this to wait until I log off, and then pounce with a new account. Sadly, looking at all this crap in my talk page, an admin would have to be retarded to not see how many of these """"accounts"""" that are proxies and not actual connections. You can only hide the smell of rotten fish for awhile before someone notices.

Shit, may was well clean this shit up. 

Oh wait a second one more thing, , what kind of retarded admin are you when having a bunch of almost all accounts pretending to be me are all on proxies and not ONE of them acts like me (did you even see my history?), and not one uses a real connection? Got that brain damage you do. had to put that in bold to be clear. Warning me about an indefinite block, lol, what does that matter, you already screwed up noticing what a 5 year old would have noticed by now. Any person would be frustrated by the silliness of this nonsense. I would appeal but something tells me to much shit damage and retarded admins will make this impossible, and I would rather not use the IP of my other account (using a real connection n my personal internet) because then you guys will probably be jackass and deleted for fun, look at this page! All this shit and nothing clicked in your small head? Amazing wikipedia. 

Also I need to take note to stay away from low ranked video game pages and focus on popular until you guys get tired of the act.

Also I KNOW you guys got an account that is going to post a bit after I submit this post I SAW him and he did the EXACT same thing 3 of the duded did, you guys need help, I can't believe not one guy was not like """"this shit don't make sense"""" for a whole second. Amazing.

Alright, so clean this page and leave this message here. Erase other extra crap. Alright, looks like we are in business. BTW, I know this is probably bull, but if any of you two actually are not trolling, which is highly unlikely, than post request an admin to come by so I can clear this account up. But I have this sinking feeling you guys all knew what's been going on here this whole time, and I have no patience to search through tons of pages to find ONE contact I can talk to about this block, so you might have this account, but you won't get the other one. Suck doesn't it? Until then, I will be going about my day and you guys will most likely probably still be doing this for X amount of days cause I guess you think it's funny? Yeah.

Brazilian Portuguese
The assertion that that the /rr/ in """"carro"""" is normally pronounced as h, x or χ is simply wrong. To the extent that such pronunciations exist at all, they are restricted to certain regions and, by and large, to uneducated speakers, and thus fall far short of being considered standard. As a matter of fact, they sound rather odd to most native speakers and would hardly ever be encountered in the media. Without conducting a scientific survey, I would say that x and χ for initial /r/ and intervocalic /rr/ are restricted to poorly educated speakers from the city of Rio de Janeiro and its surroundings, while the media and all reasonably educated speakers there are actually notorious for their use of [ʁ]. Analogously, [h] confines itself to the Centro Oeste, a large but sparsely populated region, and, again, to uneducated speakers.

"""

 Are you quoting somebody there, or is this your own list. I'll try to address the points raised:

 1) """"Hearsay"""" is rumour received from others that one did not personally hear oneself. That does not describe Table Talk, which is essentially a primary, contemporary source of edited notes taken down by scribes. Mein Kampf I believe was also began as a text dictated by Hitler, rather than written by Hitler - is that hearsay too? And what of notes taken by Speer - is that """"hearsay""""? (Interesting you note that Bormann was anti-Catholic. Why then would a """"devout Catholic"""" as you term Hitler, appoint an """"anti-Catholic"""" as his Private Secretary and the defacto Deputy Fuehrer?)

2) Multiple translations - a valid issue to raise, but given that Hitler and his henchman all, strangely enough, conversed in German, we are dependent on translations in all cases - whether it be Mein Kampf, Inside the Third Reich, or Table Talk. The fact that authors like Kershaw, Bullock, Encyclopedia Brittanica and Toland all quote from Table Talk is evidence of its essential bone fides - though if you are aware of alternative translations provided by reliable sources, please do present them (or bracket them as """"also translated as"""").

3) The """"bias"""" of the translators. Can you provide reliable sources for this please.

4) I do not know what you mean by """"the Table Talk thoughts do not occur in other private or public conversations"""". Table Talk contains all sorts of quotes which are reinforced by other sources! To pluck one from the countless options: Speer (whom you view as a reliable source) says that Hitler made """"harsh pronouncements against the churches to his political associates in Berlin"""" and specifically notes that Bormann relished to take down Hitler's harshest comments on the Churches. Goebbels diary (per Kershaw & others) is another source, confirming Hitler's thinking on the Church Struggle. 

5) You say """"Nowhere does Hitler denounce Jesus or his own brand of Christianity"""". This comment seems to suggest that you are indeed willing to accept the validity of at least some of the Table Talk text. Good. So please note: the text says Hitler believed """"it is certain that Jesus was not a Jew"""" and that the Apostle Paul """"falsified"""" Jesus' doctrine. These alone are the words of a heretic, not a """"devout Catholic"""". Agreed? As a sign of good faith, it would help at this point if you renounced the claim that Hitler was a """"devout Catholic"""". Beyond this, the transcripts are thoroughly peppered with denunciations of Christianity.

 6) The anti-Christian pronouncements contained in Table Talk are entirely consistent with the Nazi efforts to promote positive Christianity as a substitute for Christianity. The renunciation of the Bible and Jewish origins of Jesus (which """"positive Christianity"""" entailed) was to give him a """"false birth certificate"""" as Cardinal Michael Faulhaber put it in 1933, and the notion of the myth of blood and soil was, as Pope Pius XI wrote in Mit brennender Sorge in 1937, entirely inconsistent with Catholicism and Christianity more broadly: """"The peak of the revelation as reached in the Gospel of Christ is final and permanent. It knows no retouches by human hand; it admits no substitutes or arbitrary alternatives such as certain leaders pretend to draw from the so-called myth of race and blood"""". Hitler, plainly was not in """"good standing with the Church of Rome"""" in 1937!   """,0.0

I think noone is saying with """"failed state"""", that there are no parts of the state where organization has resulted in quite a livable situation.

 regarding International humanitarian law 

The protection of hospitals is according to the Geneva convention. The agreement from 1949 was also signed and ratified by the USA.
According to that agreement hospitals are protected.
The exception is: unless the facilities """"are being used, outside their humanitarian function, to commit acts harmful to the enemy"""" as rightly commented in the article. But: Even if enemy combatants are inappropriately using the facility for shelter, the """"rule of proportionality"""" usually forbids such attacks because of the high potential for civilian casualties. (why the usually as a qualifier?)
And it is not the: Human rights organization Human Rights Watch stated that the laws of war require the attacking force to issue a warning, and wait a reasonable time for a response, before attacking a medical unit being misused by combatants.
but the Geneva convention itself that requires a warning by the attacking force. And that is not a choice.
Why having qualifiers, as if the Geneva convention is not clear on the point of the protection of a hospital. And this scenario, an unannounced air strike by an AC-130 definitely falls outside a hypothetical proportional attack.
Why being so ambiguous about it, the Geneva conventions forbids the attack on a hospital, except in exceptional circumstances!  """,0.0

et tu JamesMLane?? I was always told you were the persuasive one because of your cool calm reasoned responses and up until now I had no reason to doubt this and have always accorded you the respect of analyzing your arguments and either agreeing or disagreeing.

But you both shock and surprise me with a personal attack in your very fist sentence. To suggest that I'm some knee-jerk reactionary spoling for a fight with the left wing cabal is to caricature me in a grossly distorted way. I

'm here to remove POV. Period. Now, it is acknowledged by you and others that there are currently a preponderance of liberals in here doing the editing, although no one until you would be willing to admit that there was a left-wing cabal and a sinister one at that!  
(Remember, you can't say you were 'just joking' because, as we've learned from the liberal editors of the Ann Coulter piece, unless you SPECIFICALLY say 'I was joking' when you make your statment, it means you're as serious as AIDS- so I thank you for that illuminating revelation. It is duly noted.)

Anyway, it stands to reason that most of the POV I will encounter is going to be coming from the left. Do you dispute that or do you think this Karl Rove article is filled with right wing hyperbole?

As for your arguement - """"we have to interrupt his biography to go off on a side excursion, an article-within-an-article that discusses the subject he addressed..."""" I can only say McCain...Black Baby Rumor...see above. lol! 

I find it hard to believe you can make that arguement with a straight stroke. It is PRECISELY that tit for tat meandering that is the HALLMARK of Ann Coulter and Karl Rove articles. I wish you'd use your persuasive powers to address the McCain push poll incident and Ann Coulters alleged love for terrorists instead of cherry-picking it in a realm where Rove might actually be vindicated.

So, I reject your argumentation for now. In fact, I've understood that Move-On's petition may have been specifically what Rove was referring to. Therefore to omit this information would be a deliberate attempt to leave that quote hanging out there and thus tantamount to POV by default.

And I think one 911 family group comments deserves another. Or, if you like, we can just use the conservative 911 family group's statements. Since we  don't want to make this article 'book-length' do we? 

Here's my bottom line: What's good for the goose is good for the gander. And what I've seen here since day one is one form of argumentation used to defend an article if it's good for the goose (democrat/liberal) and that EXACT SAME ARGUMENTATION trashed if it looks good for the gander (republican/conservative.) I hope you don't think I'm the only one who sees this. (Oh btw, when I make post these trenchant observations, I'm used to getting rebuked for 'getting away from content' or 'talking politics.' Funny, how your comments of the exact same nature never get that same rebuke.  Must be 'cabal club' privileges, huh? ) Take care Big Daddy. Ps I do like your style though.

 Ofthehighest (Eternity Clause)

The 'eternity clause' article is specifically about the German 'eternity clause,' and it has a German equivalent called """"Ewigkeitsklausel"""". Lone boatman did this because he was angry that I corrected him for synthesizing when changing (removing) the word """"democracy"""" and replacing it with """"constitution"""". Then another editor (Bdb484) deleted the 'eternity clause' article entirely without even discussing it on the talk page. I went to much work to reference everything in the article. What is interesting is that these additional editors (three of them) all showed up today. They had never been on the page before, but all acted quickly in agreeing with Lone boatman and vandalizing the page.  """,0.0

I'm not talking about belief of majority. In fact I would presume a billion Muslims specifically state he did not claim to be God and many of other faiths would agree.

You can object because it's unclear, but your statement """"he did not claim he was god"""" is merely your opinion. You really can't prove it. Considering the historical effect in least the concept he claimed to be god I think may make it relevant here, but I could see taking it off as disputed. Although if you want to get into it in many books I've read indicate Hong Xiuquan did not claim to be God either. He believed that Jesus was the Son of God, but not God. He had an Arian view of Jesus and of his own role as """"Son of God.""""

Yes, I forgot to address the amendment to include criticisms issue. Based on my reasoning concerning Clinton's statement, the criticisms are equally irrelevant and should not be included (in my humble opinion). To Mdiamante - I realize this is not Lexis.

I've always criticized Wikipedia based on its lack of reliability and blatant bias, but when I came across this article I thought """"Wow, maybe this is a topic I can help contribute to without all of the POV nonsense."""" Then, of course, I saw the Dred Scott section and thought """"shit."""" It's not so much that I don't think ANY cases or legal topics should include sections/statements from groups/individuals unconnected to the legal community. Indeed, it would be insane to make such a claim, given the almost-revolutionary impact of some cases - not just on society, but on legal thought. See, e.g., Roe (which, by the way, I was pleasantly surprised with). Rather, I just think some are not, and this happens to be one of them. Perhaps my opinion would be different if old Bill had supported his statement with some sort of reasoning, but he clearly did not. It was just a conclusory assertion; something my mother might say in a fit of anger. But alas, this is not a battle I'm going to wage.

"Mainly to JTD (i think) - I've just scanned through this discussion stuff having read the article. My initial impression was that this was going very kindly on the British indeed. It is admitted at some point in the discussion that there is a move among Irish historians away from previous over-simplifications of the matter - but isn't this move itself perhpas reactionary? I mean, Irish historians of this or any generation speak for their times, and, for lay readers like myself, the CONTEXT of this estimation of the role of the British imperial adventure in the famine is lost to those who have not studied so carefully the history of the history of the famine. This is, afterall, a general encyclopedia. So please twist the screws a bit. 
I won't go editing the article, but some feedback would be appreciated in this regard,

 Laughton infobox 

I noticed you amended my newly created infobox on Laughton, East Sussex. As that was just one of the hundred I am currently updating I think I better agree my criteria with you before I continue.

I agree with the Postcode and """"Boxing the Compass"""" change, its the official_name parameter that I disagree with.

Myself and another editor are having a drive on Sussex stubs by merging one line village articles into a larger parish based article, based on guidelines at WikiProject UK geography. This means that the Laughton article is about the wider ranging Parish of Laughton and not just Laughton village. To emphasise that, I used Laughton Civil Parish as the official name. In addition, the population and area statistics relate to the Parish and not just the village. I have done this on quite a few places now!

 Early Republic; 2nd paragraph 
Right,
For the 2nd paragraph, the why (for what needs to be done), and how (suggestions) -
1st, the why:

besides the 1) excessive number of bibliographical citations in Portuguese, which I claim to be unneeded, since there is abundant literature in English dealing with the subject;
My suggestion is that (keeping the paragraph short, btw depending on the option to be chosen, even shorter), must be also fixed:

2) the truncation of the narrative, referring to fix the correlational gaps of
2.1 the beginning of the republic and the military rebellions of the 1920s, and to
2.2 the mentions about all revolts of the 1930s, and not just the communist one, 
Or 
- 2.2.1 - to maintain coherence, don' mention any (1930s) revolt specifically , in the manner suggested below

3) (Regarding the briefness of the paragraph); remove the excess of detail inferred from a source in Portuguese. Details that can be contained in other more specific articles of Wikipedia, related to the history of that period
I refer specifically to this passage  """"The repression of the opposition was brutal with more than 20,000 people imprisoned, internment camps created for political prisoners in distant regions of the country, widespread torture by the government agents of repression, and censorship of the press.**"""" ; 
which can be summarized as suggested (see suggestion about Point 3) below 

My suggestions for How -
Regarding to: 
Point 1, use the abundant literature in English dealing with the subject, as some which I used

Point 2.1, a variation of what I had proposed:
 """"Little by little, a cycle of general instability sparked by these crises undermined the regime in a such extent, through various civilian and military rebellions, that by 1930 in the wake of the murder of his running mate, it was possible for the defeated opposition presidential candidate Getúlio Vargas, supported by most of the military, lead a successful revolt."""" 
Or, shorter 
 """"Little by little, a cycle of general instability sparked by these crises undermined the regime in a such extent, that by 1930 it was possible for the defeated opposition presidential candidate Getúlio Vargas supported by most of the military, lead a successful revolt."""" 

Points 2.2, 2.2.1 and 3 (bold letters)
 """"Vargas and the military who supported him, were supposed to assume the power temporarily, but instead they closed the Congress, extinguished the Constitution, ruled with emergency powers and replaced the states' governors with their supporters, having defeated between 1932 and 1938, 3 major attempts to remove them from power. Being the 1935 communist one served as an excuse for they preclude elections, launching a coup d'état in 1937, making their regime a full dictatorship, with all that this entails. """" 

Thus (following the justifications above), one possibility of how the entire paragraph could be:

 """"Little by little, a cycle of general instability sparked by these crises undermined the regime in a such extent, that by 1930 in the wake of the murder of his running mate, it was possible for the defeated opposition presidential candidate Getúlio Vargas supported by most of the military, lead a successful revolt. Vargas and the military who supported him, were supposed to assume the power temporarily, but instead they closed the Congress, extinguished the Constitution, ruled with emergency powers and replaced the states' governors with their supporters, having defeated between 1932 and 1938, 3 major attempts to remove them from power. Being the 1935 communist one served as an excuse for they preclude elections, launching a coup d'état in 1937, making their regime a full dictatorship, with all that this entails. """" 

Note that, besides Not contain the defects stated above, even With the phrase  """"in the wake of the murder of his running mate, """" - this possible version is by far a shorter paragraph than the present version.

"I'm sorry about the urgency, but, as I explained, it wasn't more urgent than removing my posts. I agree with you about the wristband not being part of shiatsu, and therefore that source is not valid for shiatsu, and I'm sorry to have included it. However, if we are going to be clear about words, acupressure does not exist, since the meaning of the word is needle pressure, so unless you are pressing with needles, the word is used incorrectly. Almost everyone has agreed that the word is used for pressure on acupuncture points. So I believe that, when a source mentions acupressure massage, it could be used for shiatsu, since shiatsu, in part at least, presses acupuncture points.

 Interesting Numbers 

While looking at the list today, I wondered how my home state, Oklahoma, compared to other states. The list currently contains 286 deaths for 2012, here is a break down of how they compare for each state. Not sure if this is something that would add any value to the article, but I thought it was interesting to look at. 11 states have no mention in the list. California accounts for 24.83% of the list. And the top 6 states account for more than half the list.

IF A PERSON ACTUALLY READ WIKIPEDIA or any other scholarly source they would not sound as ignorant.  HOWEVER, I will conclude that the two individuals in this case, Tenebrae and Bbb23 that have been conducting character assassinations on a users homepage, while blocking out an individual from using THEIR OWN ACCOUNT thoroughly displays the gestapo tactics involved, and that it was intended to mean Anti-JEWISH as many others that are not aware of the meaning of the words they use have done and continue to do (HENCE THE DEFINITION OF IGNORANCE). More to the point, however, is that I am not anti-anything, it ALL serves a purpose. Furthermore, calling someone Jewish that is Jewish is not an insult.  I am not certain that calling someone Jewish that is NOT Jewish is an insult either, but if YOU consider it to be such than perhaps you should be examining YOUR OWN CONDITION.  To continue on, claiming that I, or anyone else have ascertained information simply from reading one's chosen handle reveals just how blocked your consciousness is.

 About the revert on the """"List of Windows Phone 8.1 devices"""" page 

Hi, and I'm here to inform you there's no such thing as a """"memory card reader"""" in mobile phones and I'll hope you'll understand that. They're called """"memory card slots"""" and every mobile phone shop around the world, mobile phone info website and phone manufacturer website/instruction manual implores they're memory card slots because they're not totally external off the phone though you can remove such cards from the slot.

However if you still don't believe me then ask any one of your colleagues who went to info sites like GSMArena, Windows Phone Central or even Engadget and you'll know from them that those sites never call mobile phone memory cards slots """"readers"""". One last thing, the Memory card reader article is not accurate and I don't know how the """"Memory card slot"""" article got deleted or missing from Wikipedia but if I can get more info about the differences about the two as citations then I'm really moving that article's name to """"Memory card reader/slot"""" and add info from that deleted/missing article.

Consider also for a moment the ubiquitous discrepancy between police and protestor attendance estimates at political rallies.
IMHO attendance figures should be removed unless they are verified by a reasonably independent source. Alternatively, it should be highlighted that these are figures directly from the Catholic Church.

Would the time not be better used by going through the pages and challenging NPOV, possibly by throwing in neutrality tags and pointing out non-NPOV statements on the talk pages of those articles?

MOVED BACK FROM MY TALK PAGE:
 Moved from London Victory Parade discussion page 

As this exchange has nothing to do with the topic of the article and has everything to do with you assuming that I am editing in bad faith and trying to catch me out in a way which is quite frankly pathetic, I am moving it from that discussion page to your talk page.  

What is the title of the book you wrote about Warsaw, Varsovian? Do you know what """"M-ka"""" is ? You lived in Warsaw for ten years , you said above. Please tell me what M-ka is.  
Travellers Warsaw. Not only do I have no idea what M-ka is but my assistant (27 years old, born in Warsaw and lived here her whole life) and the professor in the office next to me (56 years old and spent entire life in Warsaw) have no idea what you're talking about either.  
What part of Warsaw you or your assistant lived in?  
I live in Muranow, she lives in Saska Kepa. Has this got anything to do with the London Victory Parade of 1946?  
Is this the book you wrote?..I'm sure the answer is in a very book you claim to write... Ask your assistant what is N24-rka then. I'm really trying hard to convince myself that you are a real account. Please help me. Thansk  
No, I wrote the second edition. And took about a quarter of the photos too. Why not buy a copy and read it from cover to cover: you will not find the words M-ka or N24-ka anywhere in it. However, you will find a rather good joke about Copernicus (or at least a good joke for anybody who knows their Monty Python).  
Well...if you lived in Warsaw and your assistant lived in Saska Kepa whole her life she would for sure knew what N24-rka is. It is the number of only night bus that goes to Saska Kepa. People in Warsaw or """"Varsovians"""" just know these things. I was born in Warsaw and I lived there for many years. Everybody knows buses and trams numbers especially in their areas. EVERYBODY. If you asked me what M-ka or N24-rka is I would tell you right away and even in the middle of the night. But thanks anyway Varsovian.  
You really are comedy gold! Firstly, to speak for myself I have no idea which night bus I would take to get home: I use these things called taxis. Secondly my assistant says that you are an idiot (although I would never use such incivil language to you). N24 does not go to Saska Kepa: it goes to Praga-Poludnie. To get to Saska Kepa she would take N72.  
Of course Varsovian...whatever you say[].  
Thank you for yet again implying that I am a liar. I do wonder if it is ever possible for you to actually be civil towards people. Thank you for your comments as to which bus goes where. I suggest that you contact ZTM (the Warsaw municipal transport company) and tell them that their website is completely wrong: they list the N24 as not going to Saska Kepa  and the N72 as going to Saska Kepa . But obviously you are right and they (and people who actually live in Warsaw) are wrong.

"The 'arguments' above consist of reiteration. I also disagree that there are significant differences between anime and animation; certainly the latter covers a far wider stylistic range and anime could be described as a subset derived from the development of particular forms of mass production (which are also found in animation from other countries, whether the USA, Korea, or anywhere else making significant amounts for the mass market); this definition would exclude Miyazaki (who, indeed, excludes himself, unlike his western fans). Likewise men in monster suits and miniature work are hardly unique to a particular national tradition. Yes, the Ultraman tradition represents as much of a speciality as Marvel/DC superheroes, and certainly deserves a specific article, but this is not the same as Tokusatu. Ergo, Tokusatu is not a genre.

In my case, I am reading an article on Markov logic networks, wherein linguistic reification is one of the early steps, followed by conversion to a lambda calculus form, and then many other steps. In this calculation, reification is a crucial step.  The """"natural stupidity"""" article cited probably just says that using reified forms (aka QLF's or quasi-logical forms) in certain ways is stupid; it cannot claim that QLF's in and of themsels are useless.

YOUR SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AND ADDICTION

This is the most """"contructive"""" thing that can ever be contributed as it relates to you and your involvement here: Please stop and think about the depth of your sickness, sitting there, with your face glued to your computer screen, uncompensated day after day, week after week, for YEARS, tinkering with the biographies of people you don't even know, who actually are out living real lives while you are imprisoned by your addiction.  You have literally wasted years of your life with this lonely, self-destructive addiction and illness, which has been at the expense of living your own life.  The depth of your mental illness must make it difficult for you to see the extraordinary insanity of your actions and how your addiction has stripped you of the life that was given you.  

I know a few others have evaluated what you do here and laugh at you and your sickness.  It's something of an inside joke, and I guess few share it with you because they consider you hopeless.  That's not right either, and I'd ask them to please stop that and try to help you.  Don't laugh at this person behind their back and then just communicate with them on routine matters.  That lacks all caring for a person who has an obvious and very serious illness. Something is very wrong with him/her, and while it may not be for us to diagnose the exact problem, we should pause to help with advice.  Please share with him/her what we all know.  It's only humane to do so. 

I will do so now too:

Jerzy (or whatever your name isconsciously concealed, I'm sure, to keep your illness as private as possible), please consider some uncomfortable facts:  Years of your life have now been totally consumed and absolutely wasted by your deep, deep sickness and obvious addiction.  Please don't make excuses for yourself.  You cannot go on like this any longer.  You need to stop, and you need to stop today.  Reject this advice, and I worry that your sickness will probably only deepen and your addiction will waste whatever is left of your life.  Please stop.  It's over.  Enough.  Move on.  I do wish you the best and hope you will take this friendly advice seriously.  It will be the first and last time I share it, and I hope you know that I share it only with your best interests in mind.  It's sad what has happened to you, but I wish you good luck and hope this advice is helpful.  But please take itand do so today.  You cannot go on like this.""",0.0

"Honestly the way wiki is treating this is a JOKE

a. I could have cited NEWS SITES but since when is a news site worthy of an academic cite?

b. if the person that wanted PEER REVIEW felt like it, he would have sought it 20 years ago, HE CHOSE NOT TO DO IT, but none the less his work is known and was mentioned in many math related 'forums' and most ignored it. 

c. Only the recent 2012 open source test of the work PROVED the 30Mod algorithm is a major thing in math, again, GITHUB is a programmers resource and it was not until a computer used the actual 30Mod algorithm that it was shown to be a 'big thing' and since then some news sites have covered it, but I chose not to cite them due to IMO they are not NPOV. But none the less they covered the story.

d. The FACT is a major computer site where programmers have free reign to challenge any claims exists and for over two years not one programmer challenged the findings.

e. so what if the person that discovered it works outside of academia and has no regard for normal 'peer review' the fact is he has no peers if you ask some in academia that know of his work, and I am one of those people that know of the work and how brilliant the work is.

Now to summarize, we have a bunch of pags about primes on wiki, and even pages created after his discovery that USE his discovery (ie. the sieve of Atkin 60Mod work is his work discussed in the public forum and usenet math and physics forums is where he chose to discuss his amazing work.

So now you have 2004 sieve of Atkin using a 60Mod algorithm, guess what that was in his 1995 paper. So does wiki acknowledge that? No. And i didn't even bother to waste my time of the 60 mod algorithm since the big deal as you are saying is the PyPrimes test and I cited that very well, it's a program created in Python, I cited the wiki python page, then I cited Github for both PyPrimes and the PyPrimes testing.

Now while MATH is m forte, I am sufficient enough in computer skills to understand what Github is and to understand how to read the speed tests and the prime spirals smoked every algorithm there is. Now anyone can download python (which I have done) and download pyprimes (which I have done) and run the tests. Guess what just like a math experiment, it is duplicated.

So GITHUB and the tests which are not 'new' should be enough to begin a wiki page on this truly amazing discovery in math.

I myself became aware of the first paper in 1995, as did others in aademia. Recently I became aware of 'news sites' running stories citing what I copied, the links to the Github tests.

While some here can say well it's not AMA, so what, in the world of primality testing primes spirals as per the PyPrimes results shows PRIME SPIRALS are a big deal.

Now I tried to be NPOV in giving all sides of the story, Adoni has a valid 1995 claim I can verify it and I chose not to. But I cited a Drexel Math forum and I could have cited many other math sites discussing his 30mod, 60mod and 90mod prime work in the 1990's. Is this signficant? You bet it is since 60Mod prime sieve aka Atkin sieve is 20004 so his 60mod prime work is well before it.

Now the Github tests mentions 'croft spirals', that's due to in 2010 a person named croft registering a web site and ripping off the 1995 work. MY OPINION.

Now Croft can say all he wants that he found it playng his guitar or whatever he is claiming.

The fact is anyone can document Adoni with Prime theory from the 1990's saying 30mod, 60mod and 90mod is the key.

9 Years later sieve of atkin appears, well that's only a rehash of the adoni 60mod work from the 1990's. Yet no one is giving him credit.

2010 croft puts out his 30Mod work and its inserted into PyPrimes on Github and it smokes every major prime algorithm there is and all of them have pages on wiki as I cited.

So 2012 a work on Github verifies how important to primality the 30mod spirals are, but he says croft spirals, well guess what HelixQ is now out there and taking 100% credit for the 1995 work of Dr. Adoni.

My site to a Drexel math site from the 1990's mentioning 30Mod prime work (prime spirals) is a major cite, since Adoni could care less about the AMA or whatever, in all probability he will soon be nominated for a Nobel on his work, that is how important it is. 

Think about it, not one prime algorithm could beat the ancient sieve of Eratosthenes, none of them. On a computer creating primes all other algorithms are terribly slow. The only two fast generators from scratch are the ancient sieve of Eratosthenes and the PRIME SPIRALS, and the winner was Prime Spirals. Now I can cite recent news articles about it, laughing at academics it links to that said it was no big deal in the 1990's who now all look foolish due",0.14285714285714285

"""As a result of the massacre in Boston, Parliament began to consider a motion to partially repeal the Townshend duties.[3] Most of the new taxes were repealed, but the tax on tea was retained. The British government continued in its attempt to tax the colonists without their consent and the Boston Tea Party and the American Revolution followed.

Following the Seven Years War 1756–1763, the British Empire was deep in debt. To help pay some of the costs of the newly expanded empire, the Parliament of Great Britain/British Parliament decided to levy new taxes on the colonies of British America. Previously, through the Trade and Navigation Acts, Parliament had used taxation to regulate the trade of the empire. However, with the Sugar Act of 1764, Parliament sought for the first time to tax the colonies for the specific purpose of raising revenue. American colonists initially objected to the Sugar Act for economic reasons, but before long they recognized that there were constitutional issues involved.

It was argued that the Bill of Rights 1688 protected British subjects from being taxed without the consent of a truly representative Parliament. Because the colonies elected no members of the British Parliament, many colonists viewed Parliament's attempt to tax them as a violation of the constitutional doctrine of taxation only by consent. Some British politicians countered this argument with the theory of """"virtual representation"""", which maintained that the colonists were in fact represented in Parliament even though they elected no members. This issue, only briefly debated following the Sugar Act, became a major point of contention following Parliament's passage of the 1765 Stamp Act. The Stamp Act proved to be wildly unpopular in the colonies, contributing to its repeal the following year, along with the lack of substantial revenue being raised.

Implicit in the Stamp Act dispute was an issue more fundamental than taxation and representation: the question of the extent of Parliament's authority in the colonies.[4] Parliament provided its answer to this question when it repealed the Stamp Act in 1766 by simultaneously passing the Declaratory Act, which proclaimed that Parliament could legislate for the colonies """"in all cases whatsoever"""".[5]

Townshend's program
Raising revenue

The first of the Townshend Acts, sometimes simply known as the Townshend Act, was the Revenue Act of 1767.[6] This act represented the Chatham ministry's new approach for generating tax revenue in the American colonies after the repeal of the Stamp Act in 1766.[7] The British government had gotten the impression that because the colonists had objected to the Stamp Act on the grounds that it was a direct (or """"internal"""") tax, colonists would therefore accept indirect (or """"external"""") taxes, such as taxes on imports.[8] With this in mind, Charles Townshend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, devised a plan that placed new duties on paper, paint, lead, glass, and tea that were imported into the colonies.[9] These were items that were not produced in North America and that the colonists were only allowed to buy from Great Britain.[10]

The British government's belief that the colonists would accept """"external"""" taxes resulted from a misunderstanding of the colonial objection to the Stamp Act. The colonists' objection to """"internal"""" taxes did not mean that they would accept """"external"""" taxes; the colonial position was that any tax laid by Parliament for the purpose of raising revenue was unconstitutional.[8] """"Townshend's mistaken belief that Americans regarded internal taxes as unconstitutional and external taxes constitutional"""", wrote historian John Phillip Reid, """"was of vital importance in the history of events leading to the Revolution.""""[11] The Townshend Revenue Act received the royal assent on 29 June 1767.[12] There was little opposition expressed in Parliament at the time. """"Never could a fateful measure have had a more quiet passage"""", wrote historian Peter Thomas.[12]

The Revenue Act was passed in conjunction with the Indemnity Act of 1767,[13] which was intended to make the tea of the British East India Company more competitive with smuggled Dutch tea.[14] The Indemnity Act repealed taxes on tea imported to England, allowing it to be re-exported more cheaply to the colonies. This tax cut in England would be partially offset by the new Revenue Act taxes on tea in the colonies.[15] The Revenue Act also reaffirmed the legality of writs of assistance, or general search warrants, which gave customs officials broad",0.0

 regarding a wiki writer 

Regarding the writer at http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html and referenced at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Hitler_salute please note the following:  Mr. Barlow is a nutter with an obsession. The history of the salute is now improved in the Roman salute article (which had many previous visits from Dr. Curry in the past - see its talk page- as Dr. Curry attempted to correct the many errors). The pact between the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is not well known, and is also not covered widely on Wikipedia, so it is """"covered up"""" by people, and those people also often refer to it as the """"Nazi-Soviet"""" pact (as the writer above does) which avoids ever using the actual name of the horrid Party (the National Socialist German Workers' Party) and reinforces the hackneyed use of the shorthand """"Nazi"""" and the myth that members of the National Socialist German Workers' Party referred to themselves as """"Nazis"""" (they did not refer to themselves as """"Nazis"""").  Some people (note the writer above) try to evade the point with odd comments such as """"It wasn't invented by Wikipedia editors to conceal the word 'socialism'!""""  That comment does not dispute the fact that there are people who use the word """"Nazi"""" to avoid ever stating the actual name of the party: The National Socialist German Workers' Party. Not only is that done in the title of the page cited (the “Nazi-Soviet pact” page) it is done on that entire article where the actual name of the Party never appears nor even the phrase """"National Socialist."""" The writer above also makes constant use of the shorthand """"Nazi"""" even when discussing the very topic at hand.  The Bellamy salute was not originally the same as the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party, as noted by Professor Curry. However, as anyone who looks at Dr. Curry's historic photographs of the salute can see, it developed into the same salute as that of the National Socialist German Workers' Party. Even the writer above concedes Dr. Curry's point that the flag was saluted with a normal military-style salute and then the arm was straightened out toward the flag during the oath. The writer above tellingly evades the point that the use of the military salute led to the change in the salute to the U.S. flag.  It is as if the writer above is conceding the point made by Professor Curry. Indeed, the writer seems to concede it with the comment """"Anyway, even if the gesture had been the same, so what? It's just a gesture. The Soviets used conventional salutes, does that mean that the US military are Communists because they use the same gesture as the Soviet military!""""   It is fascinating how the writer again avoids the actual name """"Union of Soviet Socialist Republics"""" and also uses the term """"Communist"""" instead of using the term """"Socialist.""""  The writer then attempts to avoid the issue, which is the origin of the straight-arm salute, and tries to turn the issue into an odd argument about whether salutes dictate particular dogmas.  Nevertheless, the writer evades the topic that Professor Curry has raised, which is that Francis Bellamy and Edward Bellamy were  self-proclaimed National Socialists in the USA three decades before the National Socialist German Workers' Party, and Edward's book was an international bestseller, translated into every major language (including German, which Edward spoke and wrote, and where Edward had studied as a young man) and that Edward's dogma inspired """"Nationalism"""" clubs worldwide including in Germany. 

    Yes, the """"Roman salute"""" page did once contain inaccuracies, and the writer above is to be thanked for conceding that point. But that is no reason for the writer to blabber with his use of the term """"conspiracy."""" It's just what you get when you have an open encyclopedia! The point is to correct error when you see it, and to not delete those corrections when they are made by people like Dr. Curry.   The John Seigenthaler story from Brian Chase is another notorious example of Wikipedia’s untrustworthiness.  On Wikipedia, the intellectually dishonest administrators block people who tell the truth, so it is specious to say that truth-tellers simply need to correct the articles.  

    The writer above also concedes that he is the Wikipedia editor who """"became wiser"""", by incorporating Professor Curry's discoveries.  The writer is to be thanked for crediting Dr. Curry with making it more widely available. It should be noted that the valuable information that Professor Curry provides is his own discovery.  Dr. Curry has also mentioned that the material about the use of the Roman salute in films derives from an academic article by Martin Winkler. Professor Curry pointed out that Martin Winkler did not realize at the time of Winkler's article that the films were all pre-dated by the use of the salute in the U.S. Pledg",0.0

The band promotes Croatian patriotism and ultra-nationalism, and sings about topics such as the love for one's country, family and religion, but also about the hatred of Serbs and Croatian social democrats. Dealing with such topics has made the band controversial. Perković has been known to openly promote Ustaša ideology because he wears black clothes, salutes in the corresponding way and had often openly supported the Ustaše and the NDH in his statements to the media. 

Ultra-nationalism?Ultra-nationalism means that you want to destroy everything that is not of your nation.While patriotism means that you love your own nation,but you respect others.Where in his songs does he promote hate to other nations?And no mentioning songs created in time of war against the Serbs,because it was the time of war.And only mention songs written by him.Not what he is accused of performing.

 Hatred toward SDP?Where?Name source.He is right wing,that si widely known.Of course he disagrees with their politics and he considers their politics bad for Croatia,but hatred? Reliable source please.

Where does he promote openly Ustashe?Citation please.Because he wears black clothes?Are all rockers Ustashe?By this,rock 'n' roll is equal fascism.He is a rock singer,of course he wears black clothes.
Salute he uses is an old salute of Croatian nobles,that existed long before Ustashe.

Despite this, his statements confirming his support for the Ustaše actually outnumber his denouncements of this virtual NSDAP equivalent (he is noted to have publicly voiced his support for the NDH, in various degrees, to the media on at least twenty occasions). His credibility in these statements is diminished not only by this fact but also by the legal necessity to denounce any fascist movement in order to avoid further banning (or other legal action).

The only way to improve the encyclopedia on contestable issues is if everyone attempts to enlighten others on why changes should be made.  Saying this page is crap does not help.

#2 Richard 20:53 20Feb
Yeah, so the problem as I see it, is that we still don't have a good number for how many Germans died in Poland except that maybe (according to http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=260621074909720), the max is 1 million (a number that is a little too """"round"""" for my liking).

Richard, you reading very carelessly. This is 1.1 in total not round million. Or do you ridicule the estimations at start? The """"a million"""" is because more easy was to estimate the total and the 1946-1950 loses from obvious reasons. Nobody can know exact number of deaths during flight, there was complete chaos. Who died was just buried on spot at road. Some graves disappeared just because were provisionally marked only. I remember some graves of even Polish soldiers on an edge of forest which disappeared in time. The wooden crosses just disintegrated. You do not believe because you are too young.

In any event, if you look at the numbers provided in Demographic estimates of the German exodus from Eastern Europe, you see 1,225,000 deaths in the """"Eastern German territories"""" and 263,000 in Poland for a total of 1,488,000 deaths which differs from Nitschke's estimates by about 500,000.

The 500.000 is big number, too big. I would believe in accuracy if the difference would be 100.000. But Nitschke could not count the East lost Polish teritories Kresy . Any way my goal is to separate the Flight number from Expulsion number.

If you take this downward revision of 500,000 and add it to the downward revision of 150,000 or so that the joint commission of Czech and German historians proposed, you can see how the ZgV's numbers of 2 million could be revised downards to 1 - 1.2 million which is what I believe Overmans is proposing. I don't understand the 500,000 figure yet.

 This counting I do not understand. You want see the most exact total number of deaths I suppose. What I attempt is to prevent such quacking like “Poland,…murdered millions of Germans.”. We have to assume that same individuals can be handicapped and can not read and write correctly and the info should be VERY simple.

What I'm still looking for is some indication of whether Nitschke, Haar and Overmans are widely accepted as right or if they are still the minority challenging the established majority opinion.

 In my opinion you contradict yourself. You always propagated multipoint POV. I always propagate logic and comparison. We can come closer to truth only by deduction and investigation. There will be always “minority challenging the established majority opinion” as you say. Beside not always majority is right, as you know Hitler was elected and supported by majority.

It would help if we could get some quotes that evaluate the work of these historians and puts them in context of the overall consensus of academic opinion.

If you have some idea how to do it I would try. From my experience in my professional field it is really difficult to get clue who of the researches is good and who barely satisfactory. You need to be professional yourself. Regularly scientific authors do not attack openly the opponent in scientific journals. They rather systematically attack opponent theories in extend period of time. In historical journals can be the same. Maybe you understand in this context that the academic opinion is not easy to grasp. Beside, quite often you need to know the scientists personal animosities. Some Wiki editor can be smarter then me and get multi pro and contra from popular press article on internet. Personally I do not trust popular newspapers there is too many errors and politic manipulations. I would consider “Google” type search in this point as waist of time. """,0.0

Laveol: Even last name Kolisev is a Macedonian one. Last names ending with """"ev"""", """"ov"""" are not Bulgarian. It happens that you have those in Bulgaria. But you have those last names in Macedonia, Russia, Check Republic, and so on.

Kolisev is a Macedonian last name. Same is Kolisevski. You can find both kinds with """"ov|ova"""", """"ev|eva"""", """"vski/vska"""", """"ski/ska"""" and others in Republic of Macedonia. So changing a last name from Kolisev to Kolisevski does not have any Bulgarian/AntiBulgarian implications. My last name is """"Janev"""". You can find in Macedonia also """"Janevski"""", """"Janeski"""". All of those are Macedonian last names. The fact that you can have """"Janev"""" in Bulgaria does not translate to ethnicity/origin claims in Macedonia.

Here are some last names that finish on """"ov"""", """"ev"""" and are not Bulgarian neither Macedonian:

[Sergei Lavrov]
[Anton Chekhov]
[Martina Navratilova]

So these last name endings are typical but not exclusive for some of the Slavic languages.
Same is with """"vski/vska"""", """"ski/ska"""", """"ich"""" which are shared between a number of Slavic languages.

To come back to Kolisevski: Kolisevski is a Macedonian last name, as well is Kolisev. If you can find a person living in Bulgaria with one of those last names, and probably you could not, does not gives any conclusion about ethnicity or being a Pro-Bulgarian.   """,0.0

 County lists 

Hi, I just wanted to say great work on List of United States counties and county-equivalents. That's something that WP has needed for a long time, and thank you for your excellent effort on it. I'm sure that if you expanded the lead with information from the county (United States) and County statistics of the United States articles it could become a Featured List. You could also definitely merge List of the least populous counties in the United States to your list since it's redundant. Talk 
Thank you.  The list is enormous at 694,135 bytes, so I've tried to keep extraneous information to a minimum.  The sortable table is actually quite efficient, and it should be easy to update each March when the U.S. Census estimates are released.  Yours aye,

"The statement about Scott's refusal comes from the 1911 Britannica article, and the evaluation there does sound rather negative and some other points of view would be useful, and indeed another has been added, but the Hayley quote would be an interesting addition as well if you have a source (book, article, authoritative web page) for it.  Advice on making your additions:  provide a verifiable citation for statements you make following the examples already in the article.  If you don't have a verifiable citation, it is probably best to leave the statement here on the talk page until one is found.  You may have to do minor edits to the other text to make your new text fit in.  Do your best, but if it's not perfect I'm sure someone else will give their attention to it at some point.

A quick google search made it clear that Platipigs don't exist. If it existed, there would be large amounts of news coverage, due to the discovery of a new species of Platypus-Pig hybrid.

 Image deletion 

Strictly speaking, that image probably doesn't fit any speedy deletion criterion, although some may find it qualified under a more liberal interpretation of the CSD. My main justification for the deletion was a mixture of Ignore All Rules and the Snowball clause. To answer your question, you would – in all likelihood – not have been able to tag that image for speedy deletion and have an administrator that was judiciously following the criteria delete it. The safest bet in the future would be to list such images at FfD, where they will be deleted when the time is over (perhaps sooner, as in this case). ÷seresin

Comment clarified as requested. I neither regard the citations in question as particularly respectable on the one hand, nor care on the other hand whether they were brought down from the mountain on stone tablets with Supreme Court certification and approval; the operative point is that they are irrelevant. Read what I said: """"Since neither of the two """"inventions"""" is of any significance, reference to them should be ... removed from Wikipedia ... if it is felt that some justification for calling him an inventor is necessary, possibly one of his condoms could replace the tower doodle."""" Consider: suppose some reputable news source were to assert that in primary school one of his school friends noticed him wetting his pants on one occasion; we would object to such an item as being too non-encyclopaedic and non-notable for inclusion in WP, irrespective of whether the citation were from an unknown local rag or from the Times supported by affidavits. To justify inclusion presumed accuracy and verifiability are necessary, but not sufficient. The condom thing is a pretty ignominious basis for calling him an inventor, groupie stuff in short, but since it is marketed and patented, and possibly effective for all I know, go ahead; some readers might enjoy a snigger.

As to RoyBoy, he is not very good at checking his facts. Even a cursory Google would show that Jonathan Sarfatti and Jack Sarfatti are not the same person and live on different continents. Notice how silent the Great Mathematician Dr. Hillman is in the light of Nobel Prize physicist Brian Josephson's remark above putting him in his proper place and in Hillman's inability to respond to Sarfatti's detailed argument above. It is not enough to bluster """"it's nonsense"""". Burinski will also respond he is not on e-mail all the time. None of your facts check out. Everything Sarfatti has said is the truth and his arguments on the physics have not been refuted. You people not only have no respect for truth, you simply cannot even perceive it because this information is too advanced for all of you - even Chris Hillman who is not a physicist although he is a mathematician of sorts - he admits he is not even interested in quantum theory so he should recuse himself if he were really honest.

"Interesting study on false convictions and rape 

Rapes of white women by black men account for well under 10 percent
of all rapes in the United States, but half of all rape exonerations fall in that
category.

This stark disparity suggests that prosecutions of interracial rapes
with black defendants are particularly error prone, perhaps because—as
many psychological studies show—white Americans are much more likely to
mistake one African-American stranger for another than to do so with
members of their own race.

The trouble is that we can´t find an usable way to do it, getting links in the tree. I've used HTML lists, but they don't make the cut. Tables are difficult to edit and correct. I was trying to do it with timelines, which may come in handy, but it's not as intuitive for non-tech people to edit later. Now, I see you are already busy with all the trouble with timelines, but I thought you may use a suggestion for future versions, or find an alternative. Thank you for the patience.

 Mgnbar. What is a stupid act?? 

Hi  consensus means that every body must agree.
I don’t think Wikipedia have redefined the word """"consensus"""", even if they try to redefine the word “consensus” it doesn’t matter because the question is whether you people are doing something terribly wrong and stupid? Or if my work, pictures, theories, references, text and contributions to Wikipedia are wrong.

Clearly vast amounts of my contributions are still present in Wikipedia articles such as pictures, text and theories. Everything I have put in are still there except the one reference to all the pictures, theories and text!! 
The question is if it’s ok to use your own scientific work in Wikipeida.The answer is Yes!For example, It will be impossible to incorporate pictures in Wikipedia if you can’t give away your own pictures and include your own work as a reference to the same pictures.But do anybody really think any researcher can write an scientific article which isn’t based on his or her own knowledge including research?

And, according to Wikipedia rules, if someone want to improve the articles and for some reason doesn’t want my report as a reference, they must prove it wrong by discussions on the talk page.If the reference is found to be wrong. Then all the information, pictures and theories which I have contributed to in the Wikipedia articles galling, wear and Stress(mechanics) must be deleted. Because my contributions are closely linkt to my research.God luck with deleting all my contributions =) I think you have several hours of work in front of you and still you will do a terrible stupid mistake.

 Response to Earlier Morality Accusation 
This is inresponse to a cowardly """"unsigned"""" who suggested that Thomas Alva was a pedophile. The entire section was deleted. I think the response is worth keeping as it delves into the intrigue in Edison's life.
""""Isn't the U.S. age of consent 18?""""-(as """"unsigned"""" stated).  Hey IDIOT, this was the NINETEENTH CENTURY!!! Thoughout the western world, females marrying at the age of 16 were common. Never raising as much as an eyebrow from the emerging Victoian era. Actually, a young girl marrying a man who was middle-aged and still in the prime of life was applauded AND encouraged, as well as her parents for matching her with any man who had established means. What was frowned upon at that time (and still very-much today,)was if the man were eighteen to her, say sixteen, or both were the same teen age (Though today, as was true then, a parent could get a waiver, and consent to the union). A young marriage was mightily discouraged by society AND the girl's parents in that bygone era, as they saw """"young love"""" as impetuous, irrational, and especially IMMATURE. Unless the man was shown to be of more than sufficient means, maturity and responsibility; that he came from a respected family, the whole idea was nixed. Also, remember that arranged marriages were still quite common in turn-of-the-century America. (And too, fathers were eager to get their daughters """"married off"""" as soon as possible, so they wouldn't get """"radical"""" ideas of """"independence"""" floating in their heads.) Not like the """"mail-order brides"""" of the rambling Old West! (Actually, would it surprise you that arranged unions are still widely carried out today accross every interested section and spectrum of society in the West. It's just more informal, as the female ESPECIALLY is tasked by parents and relatives to choose a mate within the liking of the parents, and often-times, relatives. """"Gotta please Mom and Dad, my grandparents AND priest, ya know?"""" You should also study more about Edison's life before making moronic and scurrilous accusations. If you did delve further, you would find that Edison's second marriage was more a """"politcal"""" arrangement than anything else, as little Mina was a neice of Thomas Alva's principal enemy and competitor JUPITER PIERPONT MORGAN. Struggling as the latter was to keep his floundering gas-light industry afloat against the inevitability of the electric street lamp. So, the marrige was a very strategically diabolic """"investment"""" on Morgan's part to overtake Edison' business, which eventually happened. (We are reminded that Morgan a a ROBBER BARON: This is what they do.)It is strange that you'd call Alva Edison a pedophile. Why, unless you seek to marr his reputation? |talk]]) Veryverser

Following this clarification, perhaps it was the article's author who attempted to resolve this by offering the results of his """"genelogical study"""" of what was conventional in such relationships in that period that Edison lived. This I felt was inadequate, so I countered with... 

We are talking SOCIAL CONVENTIONS here, of course. Naturally long before the 1960sA.D. """"women's liberation"""", all females needed their parents or guardian(s)'s consent, whether they were co-habitating with them, or the women were apart from them and\or had indepenent means. This was common all over the world, with this tradition being broken, beginingin in North America by enforced emigration(for example)of Irish and other European refugees in the nineteenth, and then again in the early twentieth centuries. Even women who were twenty-one years old in the turn-of-the nineteenth, and early twentieth century's """"middle-class"""" strata were required to seek a respectable, well-heeled sponsor, to give consent to a bethrotal if these females ever were to hope to enter what was then regarded as """"respectable"""" society"""". This all seemed to chagge in America after World War I, as there seemed to have been a definite """"cultural shift"""", throwing-off those old traditions of a previous generation and epoch. Edison's age difference is a non-issue. Even in most parts of Asia and Europe today, age in a marriage of an older man to a (well, sometimes much) younger woman is revered. Here, in the States, various wealthly and powerful men, among them old Hollywood and media types flaunt their marriage to virtual child-brides(Woody Allen, Rupert Murdock as obvious examples. Curious-wouldn't you agree-that in both cases cited, these men chose YOUNG, ORIENTAL WOMEN, rather than western ones for their """"sunset years""""). In Alva Edison's case, this was sort of a """"wirlwind romance"""" manipulated by the girl's uncle, as I cited above, to get at Edison and control of his company. Think Napolean Bonafart's divorce of Josephine to marry a Hapsburgh princess, and the world-shattering events that ensued from such a """"political"""" union. Special:Contr",0.0

"Hey Wkinght94, from Googie Man

I hope all goes well with you at Wikipedia, and you're as always, enjoying the world's greatest sport.  To answer your question, yes, I am the one who left a nasty message on a user's page whose name now escapes me.  Why did I do it?  He took off the picture of Bobby Abreu that I took, looks like he tried to replace it with a copyrighted photo, and the Abreu article went for a few weeks without an image.  Now I don't mean this as anything personal against you, as I've respected you and your work for years, and you've been nothing but nice to me.  But, what I don't get is this: I can't tell you how many times I've had to re-introduce legititmate images that have been taken down by people who upload stolen images, or images of lesser quality.  This detracts from the quality of articles, and frankly, I think people who detract from the quality of articles should'nt be allowed to edit.  What I don't get is that whenever I pop-off at someone for doing this, I get busted immediately, yet no one replaced the Abreu image, or scores of others that are taken down.  Furthermore, the guy who did this is just another red link - someone who doesn't even bother to fill out a user page.  It's all a matter of common sense and etiquette - it's not the best analogy, but you just don't go to MySpace or Facebook and start putting useless garbage on other people's pages.  
Same goes for Wikipedia - you just don't go around making articles worse, that legitmate volunteers have worked for years to constantly improve.  So, I take it upon myself to discourage users who don't add to the site.  And yes, I've been blocked permanently from editing Wikipedia, but look what happened to the guy who was the ultimate reason for my block.  If I'm a jerk, I'm a jerk towards people who deserve it, and these two most abundantly deserved it.  Anyway, sorry this is so long winded.

"""

First, I'd like to thank you for discussing this issue with me.  You could just have told me to take a hike or something.  Anyway, let's take a look at Image:Esquire Jennifer Connelly 1991 8.jpg, the Jennifer Connelly picture that I tagged today.  The image was moved to the infobox this morning which means that it was not being used according to the license.  It was instead being used specifically to depict Connelly, not in context of discussing that particular issue of the magazine.  That's why I tagged that image.  With the image moved back to the paragraph concerning the issue of the magazine, a compelling argument could be made that the image is now being used in accord with the license.  This seems to be the consensus of the people on the discussion page as well, though the discussion just started.  So, whether or not this image is fair-use depends on how it is used in the article.  I am much happier if this is spelled out in a rationale on the image page.  That the license specifically states that a detailed fair-use rationale should be added seems, to me, to support this contention.  In this case, the rationale would be simple, something along the lines of, """"used to depict issue of magazine in question in paragraph which discusses this issue, not solely to depict Connelly.""""  Now, I previously mentioned that the image description page specifically mentions that the dvdcover requires a detailed rationale.  In many cases, the fair-use case is obvious.  It's a DVD cover used to illustrate the particular DVD in question.  But the image description page and the license text both still indicate that the rationale is required.  Also, what often ends up happening is that the DVD image then gets used to depict something outside of the license.  A DVD of a movie starring Connelly, for example, used solely to illustrate what Connelly looks like.
Now, I've been using the fair-use-disputed tag for quite some time but recently, people have been correcting that to the missing-rationale tag, so I just started using that.  This has the added advantage of requiring that the issue be resolved in short order and providing a simple copy-and-paste official warning template which can be used (and is specifically designed) to warn the person who uploaded the image.
I am concerned that a great number of images on Wikipedia are used in blatant violation of copyright.  This is clear and I doubt anyone would debate it.  As a result, I personally do request that people who upload copyrighted images provide an accurate source, an accurate license, and a detailed fair-use rationale.  In all honesty, I'm quite happy with any reasonable attempt at a fair-use rationale and accept many that I believe fall far short of what Wikipedia officially requests.  I believe it is important to deal with images without sufficient information because continuing to accept images which may violate copyright put us at direct risk.  It may be obvious to the uploader why an image is fair-use but we may not be able to contact the uploader when we are sued.  And as I mentioned before, I believe both the license and image description help page specifically require this.
Now that I have stated my point and you have stated your point, there's a very good chance that we aren't going to agree.  I'm happy to request additional help, perhaps from the admin noticeboard policies page, if you think this would be productive.

 We have a very few bright-line policies here, which makes things clearer for the herding of the vast majority of editors. It may even be right to exceed 3RR in some cases, but we still maintain 3RR because overall it makes such management workable. Likewise CIVIL. It is very clear that an editor is not permitted to use such terms towards another editor: any editor. Eric's elasticity here stretches such a policy such that we can no longer hold others up to it.

 Mediation 

Hello, I am Atyndall and I have volunteered to take on your mediation case, during this discussion I will remain neutral with both sides of this argument and will endeavor to solve your dispute. After having a look at the discussion above, this is what I have found:
QuizzicalBee has been adding the sentence """"According to Chesler, the the U.S. embassy repeatedly refused to help her leave the country as they no longer recognized her as a U.S. citizen."""", Hurmata has been reverting this back to """"She reports that the U.S. embassy repeatedly refused to help her leave the country. Hurmata objects to QuizzicalBee's sentence as he/she thinks that the source is incorrect as the guards would have allowed Chesler into the embassy and first hand accounts from Chesler herself does not qualify as a reliable source. QB objects, saying that maybe in the 1960s US citizenship could have been revoked by the US/Afgan government at that time and perhaps in the past the guards may have denied entry and that her claim should have been presumed true until proven false. Hurmata countered that the citation threat QB was referring to is not the one that was cited. QB states that there is no evidence disproving her claims, so they are valid.

New article
I'm reluctant to add this as an external link because of the unnecessarily sensationalist title and free use of the c-word and questions about the sincerity/legitimacy of RS. But it does seem interesting to see this conclusion in this publication and it does seem of relevance to where this """"movement"""" is today. I wonder if there are other less offensive sources for the same opinion:
We need to remember CyberFeminism. We need draw VNS Matrix up from the depths and inject a little into our veins. It’s good medicine. These women’s voices—weird, angry, hilarious, and staunchly defiant of the (Big Daddy) Mainframe—are sorely missing from today’s many fractured conversations about feminism in online spaces. For every screed about “ethics in gaming journalism,” for every dismissal of women’s legitimate grievances about their portrayal in gaming or treatment in online comment sections, for every death threat or doxxing attempt lodged against a woman online, I long for the howling future cunts to come along and rattle some sense into the servers.

TABThe recent antics (Nanook Vandalism etc.) preformed by this anonymous user (216.164.203.90) were preformed on purpose, as a part of an experiment.  I am currently writing to you from my place of work, located in Boston, Mass, USA.  I have chosen to perform this unorthodox experiment from my workplace, in order to avoid negative votes on my possible upcoming election as an administrator, on the Wikipedia username I use from home.  The main purpose of this experiment was to know, first hand, what vandalism “feels like,” from the vandals’ point of view.  Let me tell you, “I have learned a lot” 
TABI appreciate how you all quickly reverted vandalism and left welcoming warning messages in the beginning.  When I continued to vandalize “Wolf” I appreciated how you all “Assumed Good Faith.”  However, Kim van der Linde, at times you forgot to stay “As cool as a cucumber.”  I especially admired Radio Kirk’s reaction and cool persistence with the block he initiated.  His direct quoting of the complaints of others was a smart move.  I also liked how you all continually to welcome me to Wikipedia even though I was annoying the ^&%$ out of you.  
TABSo, to recap, the recent problems caused by than account were done on purpose, as an experiment by me, in order to find better ways of combating vandalism with my other Wikipedia account.  I thank you all for you response and for now I’m signing out.  If anyone else uses the ip to access Wikipedia in the future, please regard them as a new user, as I don’t plan on using my work computer to access Wikipedia in the future.

We are not assessing the truth claims of a religion - we are assessing the historicity of an individual.  I would actually be quite happy for evidence to exist - it would make the subject more interesting and wouldn't cause the least problem for my view that the supernatural is merely wishful thinking.  Proving a certain man existed ~2000 years ago is a long way from turning him in to a god!  I'm pretty certain Michael Travesser exists, but he ain't anything other than a delusional man - despite what he and his followers believe.
As for your weak attack on my lack of expertise, it's irrelevant.  I'm as capable of sourcing and quoting expert references as the next person.  Wikipedia would be a desolate place if your reinvention of policy was implemented and only experts were able to contribute.  Your irrationality is beginning to show - 'Jesus historicity' and 'Jesus myth' are very much the same thing.

"Haitham Al Haddad article 

Sir

I wish to report again that several users are attempting to block me from editing this page. I have done nothing wrong, all I am doing is reverting the article to how it was originally. They want to input negative assertions about this person, which amount to nothing other than personal attacks. Yet when I try to undo their changes it seems they are 'ganging up' on me by making threats against me. They want t. o ban me permanantely and prevent me allowing me to have my day. I feel victimised, harassed and bullied and am getting upset about it. 

I am doing this because Mr Haddad is someone I know as he is the Imam at my local mosque.  He also has young children and if they see what has been written about him it would cause this a great deal of distress.

I have tried to mediate with the user Blixx but he/she has ignored me and has continued regardless.

Well from the offerings you have made on your wiki, blog and elsewhere, you would certainly be a gem of an editor here. Your comments on the 10 commandments to save world fisheries and your notion of a Pacific Islands Fisheries Management Index move in directions I think the Wikipedia articles should. It's true that Wikipedia is more anonymous and constrains, in that you cannot present original research, but must instead back up statements with verifiable sources. It is an encyclopedia, so the encyclopediac game must be played. But still, that doesn't have to be that constraining, and Wikipedia has many advantages. The demand to be encyclopediac can often help cut through bull shit and starkly clarify where new research is needed. Important current issues that cannot be adequately sourced can still be discussed in the talk pages, and strategies can be developed so they may eventually get appropriate external sources. Well structured articles will be here to stay. They can have modest starts, but if properly framed will lend themselves to incremental improvements over time. Your articles need not drop off the edge of the blogosphere or disappear into the limbo of deceased wikis. They will have far more traffic and outreach than blogs or personal wikis can ever have. The traffic should increase with time. And of course you can still personally invite collaborators. An article on Pacific Islands Fisheries could be set up as a start to your index project, and a very nice article it could be too. We could work it up to FA. I think """"commandments"""" for sustainable fisheries is probably the single most important topic in the Fisheries and Fishing WikiProject, and I'm sure we could eventually get that humming nicely in attention grabbing but encyclopediac ways across a number of articles.

The above paragraph is total nonsense.  It has no meaning.  Saying """"God is a paradox"""" is equivalent to saying """"God cannot exist"""" and I don't think that was your intent.  In addition, claiming that infinity cannot be understood is a vague statement at best, and even if true it still wouldn't be an argument for the existence or omnipotence of a god.  Lastly, you clearly didn't understand the God/rock argument so let me try to help.  If you claim the answer is yes, then God has a limit, if the answer is no, then God also has a limit.  Therefore God, or any being for that matter, must have limits of some kind.

ive made some minor changes to the paragraph, it isn't questioned as a source for hadith, it isn't accepted outright as a source of legislation since the only source is Ibn Ishaqs history. no history irrespective of the author is used for doctrine in Islam and all works of history take a back stage in terms of authenticity [since historians did not bother to document their works] to the works of hadith literature such as bukhari. the current phrasing made it seem as if their existed a dispute between various scholarly schools of thought regarding the narration which doesn't exist, the grading of this narration is unanimous since it never made it into any works of hadith literature. The wording also seemed apologetic which Muslim scholars would never have been regarding the actions of the prophet, they would have accepted it and used it to legislate if they deemed the source reliable. Two issues are missing in terms of context, she was calling for his assassination during a time of open warfare and she was doing it via poetry which is considered the highest form of publication among the Arabs in those times as the entire society revolved around oral tradition and poetry. Poets had a place higher than tribal leaders in that society, and where often feared as well as praised [for the good or damage they could do to a persons reputation].

""". Some just make things up as if it substitutes for the truth, and use """"mistakes"""" as """"proof"""" of being """"disruptive."""" But, very few actually can cite facts, inaccurate edits, nor bother to even think about checking sources cited. It is much easier to """"complain about Theodore7"""" and to """"revert"""" since following Wikipedia's principles about biting newcomers is an """"excuse"""" since it """"does not exist"""" and """"does not happen"""" to any newcomer. And, if they mention it - they are """"using"""" it since it doesn't exist, etc., etc. This is just one of the many problems Wikipedia newcomers face with such people. It is so much easier not to care about any subject, nor to check sources (as I do as a journalist) and to find inaccurate and unfactual materials while avoiding POV. But, to play games, to have personality conflicts as if they actually know the people they are writing to. They avoid resolving matters peacefully, but highly enjoy creating fights, building molehills into mountains, and love throwing out wild accusations. They don't ask - they assume - they immediately accuse, then complain loudly. They take everthing personally - all the while - not reading, checking sources, nor citing sources themselves on the subjects in question but adding plenty of their own POV that is not neutral, nor cited with sources. If sources run counter to their POV - then they use ruses to attempt to divert attention: and ask for RFCs on Wikipedia members who just got here, and request arbitration to resolve situations they have not even started to resolve on their own - yet claiming that they have tried. Perhaps, if some spend much more time actually checking sources, citing them, and making sure that the encylopedic materials are factual then, the """"revert wars"""" by some who want to re-write history to fit their own personal views would end, and Wikipedia could be that much more successful. So, if one is to gather evidence - show just where my edits are vandalism - where? I'd like to see it. Show my edit summaries. Show my edits, and don't cite my early mistakes as """"proof"""" of being """"disruptive"""" since I'd like to see someone claim they do not make mistakes themselves. Oh, one more thing. When a person defends themselves - try not to dismiss it as a """"diatribe"""" - but actually read it in context and take responsbility for one's own """"claims"""" against the person - in this case, a new member of Wikipedia. I've had enough of my comments being taken out of context, then pasted onto RFC and arbitration sections - and used as """"proof"""" of me being a bad person, and disruptive. I say different, and have the right to defend myself against what I consider to be a classic case of biting Wikipedia newcomers. I will take credit for my honest mistakes, but not for accusations that are false. My evidence are the comments, and retorts, and my edits - which, are cited, and soucred. Any arbitrator who wants to know more about my edits and comments can feel free to ask, or to view my comments IN CONTEXT and not TAKEN OOUT OF CONTEXT by some who are doing the constant """"complaining."""" I see no proof of any infactual edits on my part. And, my early mistakes are just that - mistakes that most newcomers to Wikipedia make. That does not justify, say your own comments Bunchofgrapes, and those of the other """"revert warriors"""" - who, in my opinion, are ruining Wikipedia. So, I've made inquiries elsewhere to make sure that perhaps this comes to an end, and that my case can be used as an example of what happens - negatively - to newcomers who run up against those who signed the RFC, and asked for arbitration.

Speedy deletion of Lev Nikolaevich Korolev
 A tag has been placed on Lev Nikolaevich Korolev requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section G12 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be a blatant copyright infringement. For legal reasons, we cannot accept copyrighted text or images borrowed from other web sites or printed material, and as a consequence, your addition will most likely be deleted. You may use external websites as a source of information, but not as a source of sentences. This part is crucial: say it in your own words.

If the external website belongs to you, and you want to allow Wikipedia to use the text — which means allowing other people to modify it — then you must include on the external site the statement """"I, (name), am the author of this article, (article name), and I release its content under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 and later."""" You might want to look at Wikipedia's policies and guidelines for more details, or ask a question here. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

 Scientists Discuss """"Evolution"""" 

“My attempts to demonstrate evolution by an experiment carried on for more than 40 years have completely failed. It is not even possible to make a caricature of an evolution out of paleobiological facts. The idea of an evolution rests on pure belief”. (Nils Heribert Nilsson, noted Swedish botanist and geneticist, of Lund University and evolutionist).

“I think in fifty years, Darwinian evolution will be gone from the science curriculum. I think people will look back on it and ask how anyone could, in their right mind, have believed this, because it's so implausible when you look at the evidence”. (Johnathan Wells, 'Icons of Evolution').

“I have come to the conclusion that Darwinism is not a testable scientific theory, but a metaphysical research program”. (Karl Popper, German born philosopher of science, called by Nobel Prize winner Peter Medawar, 'Incomparably the greatest philosopher of science who has ever lived').

“Scientists who go about teaching that evolution is a fact of life are great con-men, and the story they are telling may be the greatest hoax ever! In explaining evolution we do not have one iota of fact”. (Newton Tahmisian, Atomic Energy Commission).

“The pathetic thing about it is that many scientists are trying to prove the doctrine of evolution, which no science can do”. (Robert A. Milikan, physicist by provision and a Nobel Prize winner, speech before the American Chemical Society).

“The miracles required to make evolution feasible are far greater in number and far harder to believe than the miracle of creation”. (Richard Bliss, former professor of biology and science education as Christian Heritage College, ‘It Takes a Miracle for Evolution).

“The only competing explanation for the order we all see in the biological world is the notion of special creation”. (Colin Patterson, evolutionist and senior Paleontologist at the British Museum of Natural History, which houses more than 60.000.000 fossils).

“Evolution is a fairy tale for grown ups. This theory has helped nothing in the progress of science. It is useless”. (Prof. Louis Bounoure, Director of Research, National Center of Scientific Research).

“All of us who study the origin of life find that the more we look into it, the more we feel it is too complex to have evolved anywhere. We all believe as an article of faith that life evolved from dead matter on this planet. It is just that life’s complexity is so great, it is hard for us to imagine that it did”. (Dr. Harold Urey, Nobel Prize winner).

“A growing number of respectable scientists are defecting from the evolutionist camp, moreover, for the most part these ‘Experts’ have abandoned Darwinism, not on the basis of religious faith or biblical persuasions, but on strictly scientific grounds, and in some instances, regretfully”. (Dr. Wolfgang Smith, physicist and mathematician).

“The evolution theory is purely the product of the imagination”. (Dr. Ambrose Flemming, Pres. Philosophical Society of United Kingdom).

“I have always been slightly suspicious of the theory of evolution because of its ability to account for any property of living beings. I have therefore tried to see whether biological discoveries over the last thirty years or so fit in with Darwin’s theory. I do not think that they do. To my mind, the theory does not stand up at all”. (H. Lipson, “A Physicist Looks at Evolution“, Physic Bulletin, Page 138).

“The talk of evolution is sheer nonsense not founded on observation and wholly unsupported by fact. This Museum is full of proof of the utter falsity of their view”. (Niles Ethredge, British Museum of Science).

“(Evolution is) a great cosmologic myth of the twentieth century”. (Michael Denton, molecular biochemist, ‘Evolution, Theory in Crisis’).

“The evolutionary establishment fears creation science, because evolution itself crumbles when challenged by evidence. In the 1970s and 1980s, hundreds of public debates were arranged between evolutionary scientists and creation scientists. The latter scored resounding victories, with the result that, today, few evolutionists will debate. Isaac Asimov, Stephen Jay Gould, and the late Carl Sagan, while highly critical of creationism, all declined to debate”. (James Perloff, ‘Tornado in a Junkyard’, This book was published in the year 1999, Page 241).

“Evolution is faith, a religion”. (Louis T. More, professor of paleontology at Princeton University).

“Evolution is baseless and quite incredible”. (John Ambrose, ‘The Unleashing of Evolutionary Thought’).

“Darwinism itself has become a religion”. (Norman Macbeth).

“There is no evidence, scientific or otherwise, to support the theory of evolution”. (Cecil Wakely).

Question
Hi Alex, regarding this talk page tag which appears on the Transcendental Meditation article:

At present it only appears on the talk page of the one, main article. Would it be proper and useful for me to add it to the talk pages of other articles in the topic area? I like to do it but don't know what the protocol is on this. I notice that the Abortion topic has it on multiple talk pages. any insight you can give is appreciated. Thanks,  —  • Talk •  """,0.0

Qualifications?

Or are you a self-appointed, sad individual who cannot 'make-it' in the real world and feels that you must be the 'big guy' on the internet? You are the epitome of what is wrong with Wikipedia. 

The fact that this comment has been undone and you made threats to 'ban' its author rather proves the point: no comment can be made against the Wikipedia 'Nazis.' If you remove this comment then you are proving my point. Just comment on it and say I am wrong, rather than the sinister and clearly controlling approach you take. Retain my views and comment upon them here rather than be controlling. I may be wrong but as it stands you conform to the stereotype of the sexless, right-wing, American madmen who control Wikipedia. What kick do you get out of your control - is it sexual or poiitical? You have proved me right by deleting my commments.

"TAB I made changes to the Feminism in Many Forms section.  I decided to give brief descriptions of some of the major branches or ideologies of feminism.  They are each only a few sentences long, and are my attempt to summarize the branches of feminism.  I figured that the four (liberal, radical, socialist, eco-) that I focused on were important, since they are the most commonly discussed and identified with.  I felt this was necessary so that readers could be adequately introduced to and informed of the distinctly different forms of feminism.  The descriptions include a list of people who would be considered important figures within each movement, and any suggestions to alterations or additions to those lists are appreciated.  
TAB I also removed some information from the article, which talked about egalitarian and protectionist feminism.  While these are terms that should be explored somewhere, they may not be needed in this initial discussion of the different forms of feminism.  This section seems to tell more about ideological splits mostly within liberal feminism, and does little to display the depth of ideas and tactics that make up feminism as a whole.  The page also only discussed radical feminism in relation to separatist movements, which is only displaying the most extreme part of radical feminist ideology while ignoring anything else that the movement may have to say.  The last part that I removed talked about feminist-sympathetic men’s groups.  I feel like this is something that should be addressed elsewhere, looking at these groups and the ways in which men are placed when they try to be a part of the feminist movement.
TAB This page could definitely use some embellishment, concerning feminist theory and the works of some of these influential people, but I felt that there needed to be a basic description of the most common fields of feminism before the page could be improved upon.",0.0

That's it.  In the John H. Sununu article it states his father's profession and where he was from. Also more than this article. In Alexander Haig, a 4 star general and far more notable than Emanuel, there is nothing on his father. In H. R. Haldeman, it says that his father donated money to the Republican party. If that is your basis for the inclusion of a discussion of his father's activities it is pretty weak. Firstly, there is no wikilink that would resolve this addition like [Irgun]]. Secondly, its not a POV. In summation, the general scheme of COS's is not to include background information on the person's father, which makes the desperation of some editors to include POV edits in this article all the more perplexing. crewer (yada, yada)

Or epistemology. Or logic.  We can thank Dewey and the Pragmatists for that.  But I digress. 
While an autodidact (notice the second 'd') is defined as a self-taught person, it is not necessarily the case the reverse is true. 
But we are also talking about connotation and a quirk about English grammar. When you say a person """"is self-taught"""", because taught is in the past tense, it gives the impression of being in the past. It is also ambiguous, as people are likely to say/think/ask, """"self-taught in what?""""  But if you say a person is an autodidact, it maintains the present tense and does not suggest when the self-teaching occurred.  It also implies a general sense of being self-taught. For instance, I taught myself how to program computers. But I don't go around claiming I'm an autodidact. With Langdon, if you say he is """"self-taught"""" and mention his IQ and status as a bouncer, well, that hardly gives a meaningful impression. 
For that reason it's as I stated earlier  an approach to learning. Langan is generally self-taught (or something like that), but more critically, I think, his attitude seems to be """"why should I bother learning from someone who is my intellectual inferior"""". That's the impression I got from the video interview. 
Having said that, I assume someone else did call him an autodidact, right? Because if not, then the whole thing is OR.

I have no desire to belong to bin Laden's group, only to create factually correct articles.

Nowhere in the Jihad Against Zionists and Crusaders fatwa, does the WIF limit the membership of the organization to Muslim. In his video and audio addresses, bin Ladin often refers to the International Front for Jihad against the Zionists and Crusaders (IFJZC) as a multi-cultural organization or movement concerned primarily with doing what is right for all people by objecting to the special interests of Zionists and Crusaders.

 Dear Leslie fyans, hello, and welcome to Wikipedia! I hope to not seem unfriendly, but I'd like to bring to your attention the conflict of interest guideline which explains the potential incompatibility between the purpose of Wikipedia to produce a neutral, verifiable encyclopedia, and the purposes of an individual editor. Conflict of interest editing often involves contributing to Wikipedia in order to promote yourself, your friends or family, or the interests of other individuals, companies, or groups you are closely associated with. When an editor disregards the aims of Wikipedia to advance outside interests, they stand in a conflict. Please review this guideline, and you may wish to also review the notability guidelines as well. Thank you for your interest in Wikipedia, and I hope you'll find many helpful areas! Sincerely, Ariel♥Gold 
Hi Leslie, I'm placing this here for your review, as your submission to articles for creation was specifically about yourself. Also please see Wikipedia:Autobiography, along the same lines. Normally if you are notable enough, reliable, third-party sources will exist, and an article will have been written. If you are notable (again refer to the notability requirements), but the article does not exist, you may request it, but either way, you should not edit an article about yourself, as explained above, as it would be quite difficult to remain neutral, which is one of the core policies of Wikipedia. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Thanks! Ariel♥Gold """,0.0

Hi, I see JayJG has been leaving messages on your page, with his false concern about the rules and supposed reasonableness.  In reality, JayJG is a rabid Zionist and is trying to purge Wikipedia of any negative information about Zionism, and is trying to paint Muslims in a bad light.  Along with many of his cohorts.

The problem is that JayJG is part of the Wikipedia cabal.  When there were elections, despite massive efforts to the contrary, a number of people got a higher vote percentage than JayJG - but Jimbo Wales put him on ArbCom anyhow.  Jimbo has shown his true colors as well.

These people control Wikipedia.  They are all together, and attacking you.  No one is coming to your aid.  This is because they control Wikipedia, with Jimbo at the center, and have more or less driven off everyone else.  You are banging your head against a wall here - any massacre by Zionists against Palestinians will be covered up, disorted, justified etc., anyone who attacks an Israeli soldier will be castigated here.

My suggestion is to direct your efforts to somewhere more creative, like a wiki encyclopedia that is not pro-Zionist and anti-Muslim like this one.

Maybe we could also have separate casuality sections for the different (major) countries, with text and tables where there could be made room for lower and upper bounds on numbers and space for citing different sources and their numbers. Not so much that I expect you to find and look up every different estimate, but there are many people editing and there could be a value in having room for those comming here later with different sources to add to the information.

 Archiving deleted gay material 

It has been suggested the two are gay or suffering from gender confusion. Rod stated in 'Tis the Fifteenth Season he was jealous of girls because they get to wear dresses. In Bart to the Future, an episode depicting the future, Ned thanks Bart for not outing Rod and Todd who are shown bare-chested washing a cabinet in a slightly feminine way whilst wearing tight denim cut-off shorts and sporting mustaches, known as the Castro clone style fashionable in gay culture in the 1980s and popularized by Freddie Mercury.
Rod and Todd are both extremely sheltered from girls as their father consider girls to be a temptation along with rock and roll music. In another future-set episode, """"Future-Drama"""" Bart's girlfriend mentions she wants to make love to him on prom night, and becomes disappointed when he denies her. She says, """"I never had this problem with Todd Flanders!"""", implying a strong, though latent, sexuality in the boy.

 Sexual Abuse Section - Swiss Rejection of Extradition Request. 

The current information in the sexual abuse section give great detail on portions of what the Swiss said was there basis for the denial of the US request.  
However it is not at all balanced by the US perspective.  This makes it appear not NPOV in my view.  Problems include.
1.  There is a dispute of whether the documents were requested or not.
2.  It a large change from standard extradition requests, the Swiss evaluated the merits of the case, and the punishment used.  They speculated that the 42 days of evaluation could have been the entire sentence.   That speculation is defense argument for matters that have not been determined in the courts.  In this way the Swiss became a judge of the case, to which the US was not allowed to argue against.  This deviation from standard means of handling extradition requests is already being speculated to have a lasting impact on other cases.

Here are some of the concerns on the other side of what is currently written:

The Swiss government said its decision to reject extradition was partly based on U.S. authorities' failure to turn over transcripts of secret testimony given by the attorney who originally handled the director's case. The testimony """"should prove"""" that Polanski already served his sentence with the court-ordered diagnostic study, the Swiss Justice Ministry said.  

The main issue appeared to be how the Swiss government expanded its focus beyond the formalities of the American extradition request to pass judgment on allegations of misconduct by Los Angeles authorities.

""""This was an admission that when higher interests are at stake, not everyone is equal before the law,"""" wrote the widely respected Neue Zuercher Zeitung newspaper. """"Some are a bit more equal.""""

Another Zurich paper, the Tages-Anzeiger, called the Swiss decision """"shaky.""""

""""It breaks with the tradition of only examining the formal correctness of extradition requests,"""" it said. """"Perhaps the new practice will in the future also benefit detainees who have less of a lobby than the world-famous director.""""
http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hwv8qKQSMIhfdh2oT7hD0TeXDMpgD9GUC3O80

ALL of this does not explain why Polanski skipped out of his sentencing hearing, if he believed he had served his sentence, and when he quite capable lawyers representing him before the judge.

So I see the rational used by the Swiss to be controverted and biased to the defense agreements, which have never been tested before a court of law.  To where these arguments were argued, the Judges refused to grant their merit.  The method the Swiss used to determine the extradition request is entirely new.  So I believe these sentences in the section either need balancing of the two sides, and or pared down.

""""Only 60 million Americans (out of the 300 million Americans total) voted to re-elect President Bush."""" 
This sentence is technically true, and it is technically factual, but it is also misleading and unfair to President Bush. The sentence implies that while only 60 million supported the President, the other 240 million didn't vote for him. This is technically true, but it's totally unfair and misleading. The fact is, most American's don't vote, and the majority of those 300 million were """"undecided"""", not """"opposed to Bush"""". And as we know, Bush was, in fact, the most popular candidate. So to say """"60 million out of 300 million total supported Bush"""" is simply very, very misleading even if every word of it happens to be true.

"""== Attributing and classifying of personalities == 
Invitation. Your input to Culture of Lithuania is welcomed. 
Some problems of defining personalities or attributing them to certain well-known ideological systems may raise here. I propose a quite liberal variant of it, where definition may not be connected with one certain word. Necessity however to follow certain classifying remains. 

My initial ideas on this branch, the ones, concerning period of Lithuanian national Renaissance period: Some artists, writers or other cultural workers of this period are often described as  modernists. This definition is not false, but some more concrete things should be added, some specifics of Lithuania. 
We should distinguish leading ideas of the Nat. Renaissance from later modernism, which is more known for us. Cultural aspirations of the later Nat. Ren. may be defined as  modernism in a cultural context of Lithuania. But they accented also expression of Lithuanian cultural heritage, and their expression may be seen as something simply typically  Lithuanian. I mean, that such authors in as  Čiurlionis is seen as modernist in Lithuanian context, but it also (and even more) is a representative of Lithuanian culture, when in European or World-wide context. A parallel  example may be taken from literature of India. Poet  Tagore, well known Nobel price winner is known for us as a representative of culture of India. Making India more understandable and closer for western people is concerned as main his input to Western culture. But in his own country, he was seen as a modernist too, who was changing traditional cultural forms, especially stagnated ones. This way also Lithuanian cultural leaders of the N. Ren. could be seen as modernists, which were broadening cultural forms and changing stagnated ones, in Lithuanian context. They also can be seen as modernists in a wider context, but more for acquainting Western people with Lithuanian culture than for their direct input into Western culture. Čiurlionis is the best example here. 
In other way, the later Lithuanian modernists (they depended mostly to later  generation, approximately from 4th decade of the 20th century) concerned themselves part of Western modernistic movement and their main purpose (looking generally) was  to introduce Western European ideas into Lithuanian cultural life (see the table below). 
We see two different movements and two different world outlooks here. The problem is, that both movements collaborated, especially their political wings did, and interchange of ideas between them is well seen. So, many researchers don't pay attention to this difference. Especially in the Soviet period, when national ideas were officially forbidden, mixture in description of these movements was allowed. E. g. philosopher Ramūnas Bytautas, who clearly depends to the first generation, is often described as liberal. And it may be understood in a sense of the second generation (as idea of liberalism).

Fair use rationale for Image:Soyyocdcover.jpg

Thanks for uploading or contributing to Image:Soyyocdcover.jpg. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Suggestions on how to do so can be found  here.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page. 

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the """"my contributions"""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"Image"""" from the dropdown box. Note that any non-free media lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on criteria for speedy deletion.

 the following should be included 

Child Porn Charges

It is noteworthy that instead of watching his daughter and protecting her, Mark Lunsford was allegedly busy on the internet viewing child pornography. Ironically, many of the """"Jessica's laws"""" that Lunsford fought so hard to get on the books dealt heavy blows to viewers of child porn, like Mark Lunsford, yet, Lunsford was never prosecuted under the existing federal laws for viewing child porn which would have landed Lunsford in federal prison and required him to register as a sex offender. Contained in the documents released by the State Attorney's office were notes from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement that mention child pornography on Mark Lundsford computer. The images & documents were found Feb. 24 — the day Jessica was reported missing from her South Sonata Avenue home — Assistant State Attorney Pete Magrino said the images were found on Lunsford's computer. However, he said his office is not pursuing charges. [3]

Plastic Surgery

Lunsford surprised many in July 2007 when he appeared in the media having undergone several cosmetic surgeries, including a face lift, dermabrasion, and eye surgery. 4

Father of Child Molester

In 2007, Joshua Lunsford, Mark Lunsford's son was arrested for having molested a 14 year old girl in Ohio. Despite Lunsford's public attack on all sex offenders, he seemed to be ready and willing to defend his own son's sex crimes and in fact may have played a vital role in the unequal treatment of Mark's sexual predator son. Joshua Lunsford was ordered to undergo sex offender evaluation but special treatment was administered and Joshua avoided felony charges and sex offender registration.[5]""",0.0

"Choose your Loyalties 

Sir,

It has come to my attention that despite taking advantage of our first-rate American education facilities, you insist upon identifying as a Bangladeshi.

My parents are/were Bangladeshis, and they were amongst the most wretched people I have ever had the misfortune of knowing; Indeed, during this unfortunate period of my life that I have been forced to spend in Bangladesh due to my father, I am now convinced that Bangladesh is the single most unworthy nation to exist. (I use are/were because, I regret to say, my mother was struck dead by Bangladesh - and despite her dysfunctional state and pathological lying, I mourn her loss greatly.)

Never have I felt more love for my country than now, when I find myself forced away from it! I have now given my loyalty, heart and soul, to the United States of America: The greatest country in the world, God bless every inch of it.

But after my experiences with Bangladeshis, I cannot allow for one such as yourself to leech off of the United States while offering nothing in return. I implore you to either renounce Bangladesh and enjoy the remainder of your life in the blessed free world, or get the fuck out of my country, you filthy ape.

 Issue on images still unresolved 

Slim, I'm copying this message and my reply to your page for your notice.

I appreciate your inputs in Image talk:Monkey3.jpg and I agree once in a while I might sound rude (purely unintentional, since I put facts blantly). But SlimVirgin is abusing his admin power to overrule anyone.

Slim is not a """"he"""". Given that she named herself after a Javanese princess, perhaps you could take the hint and note that she's a woman. Also, I don't think you were simply blunt. I think you were rude to Slim. I recognise it's a fine line but given that I've mentioned it to you, perhaps you'll take more care to stay on the right side of it?

She has suggested in an email to me, that she is in talks with another editor. Now, I don't know who this other editor and i certainly don't like this secrecy. Instead of having a discussion on this, she wants to finish the matter begind closed doors. She could've atleast told me who this reputed editor was to let me have a word with him/her.

Perhaps she is seeking guidance on how she should approach you and wants that to be untainted by your input. I think that would be reasonable. I have a high regard for Slim and I don't think she would have a nefarious purpose in speaking to a third party.

Inso far as the images are concerned, I had stated to her a couple of images on one issue (animal rights) is ok, but she insists she needs to showcase the entire album provided by PETA and its assocites.

So you have a dispute. You need to recognise that you are not necessarily right! You disagree about how many images are necessary. I feel that you have to allow that your disagreement might be fuelled by your political differences as much as how you interpret the image policy.

This should could easily achieve by providing an external link to the images provided by a controversial organization.

The BUAV is not a """"controversial organisation"""". It is a highly respected body, whose voice is listened to in all circles of British society. A viewpoint doesn't become """"controversial"""" just because you don't share it.

Wikipedia is supposed to be neutral and not have extreme viewpoints - 

But you expect it to reflect your viewpoint.

thus I requested her to limit her fair use policy in this regard to 2-3 images which can be used across similar articles. this she refuses.

I don't see how it is any fairer to use one, two or ten images in this instance. While I agree that Slim could have taken more care to provide a rationale for using the images, I simply don't feel that your argument about how many she should have used has much weight. One factor in deciding fair use is how much of a thing you use, that's true, but it's only one factor, and obviously, each picture is a separate case to be considered as well as part of a whole.

As far as the other images, some are on personalities she claims have """"agreed"""" to use their photos here. Unless she gets a written consent and a permission how can I believe.

First of all, you can believe Slim because you assume good faith. Perhaps you're not aware of that policy. Yes, you can ask Slim to provide evidence of that, but your assumption should be that she has in fact acquired that agreement. Harassing another editor to provide evidence to your satisfaction and insisting you won't believe them until they have do not show an assumption of good faith.

Once I pointed out that {permission} photos would be deleted anyway, she backed off and argued that it be kept on the grounds of fair use asking me to trust her.

Yes, okay. Trust her AND ask for proof.

Both of us are editing in good faith, but one of us has power and a circle of friends to back her while the other (me) relies on the hope that ppl. like you will help me out in this.

I'd urge you to rely on the issues rather than the personalities. Yes, Slim does have powerful friends, who will back her regardless, but you should still do your best to make it about the issue in question and not about her.

If she gets away with this and sets a precedence then I'm afraid there are hordes of copyviolaters straining at the leashes to bomb Wikipedia with copyrighted information.

''I think that's a bit dramatic but I agree that she has to obey the rules, which exist for good reason, and shouldn't be given a pass just because she is friends with the arbcom. However, she is not a """"copyviolater"""" trying to destroy Wikipedia.

 Vandalism by User Sitush 

You have removed large chunks of materiel from the Singahi article on spurious grounds. As an Independent Wikepedia investigator I have historically examined several of your edits and there seems a certian lack of integrity to your character. I use harsh words here, take for instance (and one can not hide anything in wikipedia The Singhai article you said you did not believe the cited sources and removed large parts of the article. Well the article was cited with proper academic rigor, and its up to you now to go into the sources. I have done so and verified the sources of this article. Now the question remains why you chose to edit this article and what did you not like about it. I suspect and I need to built a case via an investigation on all your Wikipedia edits, is that you are following a political agenda and would like to see a distortion of Indian History. The sang Parivar or RSS also follows this agenda and several users and administrators have been banned from Wikipedia after their peers investigated.
The Guardians of the articles in Wikipedia are the users themselves along with the transparency of all edits which undergo a peer review.
I am sorry Sitush you have failed this peer review. Moreover I suspect the accolades and the praise on your user page is similariry manufactured by yourself and your friends

   

 That's a serious case of not assuming WP:GOODFAITH. Calling good faith edits """"vandalism"""" is not appreciated around here...  -Let's talk!

Kosovo is the drug-trading hot-spot, and so is Albania. Half of the population of Albania are still farmers, using tools that were used centuries ago. Albania has a large gray economy that may be as large as 50% of official GDP. Now, as far as wars are concerned, Albanians have, only in the last 15 years, started three, one in Kosovo, one in South Serbia (Presevo Valley), and one in Macedonia. All were wars of secession, wherever they go, they want to separate. This is not propaganda, this is fact, and anyone in the world can check it. Comparing to Serbia's percentage of 96% who can read and write, Albania's percentage of 86% sounds low. I have never heard, in my 16 years of living in Serbia, that Albanians have tails, I'm affraid you made that up. Furthermore, the Greater Albania concept still lives in Albania, Kosovo, Montenegro, Serbia, Macedonia and Greece, while the """"Greater Serbia"""" dream has faded away long ago.

I only came across the dispute quite recently, although the article was on my watchlist as a vandalism target. This editor insists on writing """"jesus"""" (quotation marks, and lower case) all over the talk page, to make the point that Jesus wasn't a real person, and for a while he was adding a paragraph saying that there was no evidence that he had ever existed. I do recall reading that the agreement was that if articles already had CE, they shouldn't be changed to AD, and if they had AD, they shouldn't be changed to CE. I haven't found the relevant page. I think the dating of the Gospels is more important. I have Robinson, Tresmontant, and Carmignac in the house, but have only skimmed through them. They, as you know, argue for an early date.

The Republic of Central Lithuania was neither formed because of the revolution nor during it. I kindly ask you to explain the connection between the Russian revolution and Central Lithuania before you put back the category.

So I am wondering, will Venom & Sand Man are to be in it, will Harry be in it? I am thinking Harry might appear in Spiderman 4

But Peter will meet a new girl in his life, """"Betty"""". It is said that someone close to Peter will die in this movie. And I am greatly sure it will be Betty, cuz it's official. Because in Spidy comics, She dies, and dies by the hands of Green Goblin. So Harry will have to be in this movie.

What about Venom? In Spidy cartoon, one the old one, it's kinda like modern, the cartoon that sometimes have 3D buildings. In that cartoon, Spidey had the venom custome before, then abandoned it, and the venom came to Eddy Brook. I am thinking, the ending of this movie, might be Peter leaving the Venom suit, and the suit meeting up with Eddy, then Venom will appear in Spiderman 4

Sorry, if this is a spoiler:P

"Padmini Visuddha EkAdasii
Ekadashi, in Vedic (Vaishnava) calendar is a fasting day. This is day of Lord Hari (Vishnu), so one has to dedicate this day to Vishnu, thus one has to do more fasting, especially from crops (beans). In Vedas persons refrain from meat, eggs, flesh/blood 'food' completely, but on this day (Ekadashi) one even refrains from beans/crops like rice, as Kali (material lust) may hide there on Ekadashi day. This day Vishnu has to be satisfied and not our tongue, belly etc.

Padmini Visuddha EkAdasii occurs during the light fortnight (shukla paksha) of the extra, leap year month known as Adhika month. This Adhika month is considered to be very auspicious (adhika = best or greatest), as Vishnu appearing Himself. This month (Adhika Maasa) comes once every two (sometimes three) years, and so also this Ekadashi. Padmini Visuddha EkAdasii'' comes on Purushottam Shukla Paksh'''.

The """"ranks"""" aren't really indicative of any power and only really serve to indicate who organises the project at the top level, otherwise it's fairly meaningless. You can join but you won't be appointed any title as it's a level playing field here. 

As for the ongoing issue with Talk:The Powerpuff Girls, I've been watching and noticing the edit war you have with  to me and the information about the ratings and demographics could be shortened as the article comes across as fairly one-sided and fanboyish with such info. You need arbitration but moreso need to get a consensus on notability and push the quality up so it can be opined correctly at Peer Review which many CN articles will be undergoing from B-Class down. 

Thanks for your enquiry though, hopefully this helped and if you require more help you can ask User Talk:Yngvarr who has a good record for helpfulness.   talk 

I'll take your words. Since you said that Marcus2 was right about the Cultural References thing, then I'll just let it go if he comes back. Thanks for your assitance Treelo. I'll try my best to make Wikipedia a peaceful place. I learned that I don't really need a rank after all. I should just, like I said, keep Wikipedia peaceful, that's all.

The problem is not what you're trying to say but how you're going about saying it.  Quoting the subject of an article in the form """"She remembers saying..."""" is simply not encyclopaedic at all.  That was the problem with the first as well.  Nothing wrong with saying that she denied her rape had anything to do with her later career choice, but write it like an encyclopaedia article and not a magazine piece or fan page.  Similarly with the second one - say it, if it needs to be said, but not like this.  Try """"At this time, she stated her intention etc etc [ref]"""".

The problem of unencyclopaedic style is present throughout the article.  Examples include """"In her autobiography, Massoli writes that"""" - why not omit that and put a reference at the end?  """"(Preacher has denied this.)""""  - why is this sentence in brackets?  """"Jameson says..."""" - again, more like a magazine article.  The list of awards is meaningless, really.  It adds nothing to the article.  Why not just have a sentence saying """"Her films have won numerous industry awards""""?

Oh, and here is the response I posted, that got erased: 

REDVEЯS, I do not feel my comments are poisonous. Other people agree with me. The """"good editor"""" you describe is often very harsh in his dealings with others and seems to put his own personal pride ahead of common sense when he prevents pictures other than his from being used. As far as I know, most people on Wikipedia conceal their true identities including David Shankbone and yourself. To be called cowardly for merely highlighting the anonymity we all use is ridiculous. You say my criticism of David Shankbone is disgusting. What I find disgusting are his insensitive, uncaring, and simply awful author photos, and the egotistical ways he defends them.
And here is my response to you, David Shankbone: There's a difference between attending a public event and expecting a photo to appear for one day in a local newspaper, vs. having that event define your permanent image on a site as widely used as Wikipedia. Your animosity toward authors demonstrates your own lack of a NPOV. Your history with Sharyn November is more complicated than you describe. She at first repeatedly tried to take down the photo you took of her (as anyone can see in the history of her page), and it wasn't until you used intimidation (on a talk page I think, by implying she shouldn't even be writing on her page due to neutral point of view issues and might be blocked) that she immediately backed down and got friendly, clearly out of fear that you would block her. —Preceding unsigned comment added by Anonymous 374 (talk • contribs) """,0.14285714285714285

The user's final edit was to blank his Talk page with the edit summary """"fuck it.""""  The page blanking was reverted """"because of an active block"""".  The block is no longer active, the user has not returned to Wikipedia, and I think it is pretty clear that """"fuck it"""" is the equivalent of """"I am retiring from Wikipedia.""""  It seems to me that if someone has expressed quite clearly that they don't want to come back to Wikipedia and that they don't want their sad saga displayed on their Talk page for all eternity, that is within their rights.
Also, I question whether the initial reversion of the page blanking was even according to policy.  Show me one policy that says you cannot blank active block messages on your talk page, hmmm?  While WP:DRC is merely a guideline, there is a distinct lack of Wikipedia policy limiting what kind of content users can remove from their Talk page.  I happen to think there should be policy limiting what a person is allowed to remove from their own talk page (e.g. warnings <24 hours old and active block notices) but as it currently stands there is no such policy, at least not that I can find.  (If I am wrong, please enlighten me!)
If I have to abide by rules I think are dumb, then so does everybody else.  In fact, that is the difference between us and Karaku  Karaku disagreed with the rules so he chose to aggressively break them and call everyone else ignorant.  I disagree with the rules, but I realize they have been formed by community consensus and so I will abide by them as long as they are in place.  And by my interpretation of the current rules, Karaku's blanking of the Talk page should never have been reverted.  
Furthermore, while I recognize that I was using the word """"VANISH"""" imprecisely, it appears to be a longstanding tradition in Wikipedia that if a user wants to just leave and clear out the ugly history of their wrongdoing, they have the right to do that.  Karaku very clearly indicated a desire to do just that (is there really that much difference between putting a banner saying """"Retired"""" at the top of your Talk page vs. blanking the thing with the edit summary """"fuck it""""?).
Anyway, I'm obviously not going to get in an edit war over a retired user's talk page.  I'm just sort of surprised at the insistence to leave all this stuff in place when the user doesn't want it and Wikipedia policy provides no mechanism to override those wishes...   """,0.14285714285714285

 DYK for 2012 Istanbul Anti-Armenian protests 

Hello. Thank you very much for the concerns you raised with the article. I appreciate your good faith commentary. I added a source you needed for the """"bastards of Hrant wont scare us"""" (Azeri news source) that you said was needed. Thank you for pointing that out. The """"Let Armenia be Gone"""" is in the source number 7 already and is in Turkish (Ermenistan Yok Olsun) from the highly credible Radikal newspaper. I also fixed the concerns you raised about direct quoting regarding the """"Today Taksim, Tomorrow, Yerevan"""". Thank you very much for your commentary. Happy holidays.   """,0.0

The opponent calling me hysterical did so when I had not posted anythiing at all so you should read the page again, what is written in capital letter was inserted long after the texts previous to it and after it had been written, so you can see that he is asking for my banishment for no reasons at all.
I have not being editing ANYTHING AT ALL on this site and you know that.
YBM has been editing all my writtings on it from the beginning also those of a user called Laurence but you never noticed it and do not blame him for that WHY? does he have the right to do it or are you just YBM himself?
I don't see why you are talking about people who cannot read french as all I read is written in english and the links you talk about show a webside with links in it to the same contain in english and in german. Things you will know if you had consulted them instead of attacking me.
You talk about yelling I am attackt for no reason and have to be subject to punishments which I do not deserve, and that you impose on me unjustified.
All the reason you evoce her do not exist.
I do not have edit anyone but my own texts.
I write in english
My links show a place written in 3 different languages.
Links shown by other also show french web site in french like fr. physic and there is links on the french site about the bogdanov affair who show web site in english, so what you are saying is rabbish, and od not constitute an excuse for expulsion but are low argumentation to show an excuse to through me out, exactly as YBM did.
The links i showed are not a web site about the bogdanov but about Voyer and YBM who act as a prove that the motives of YBM in that affair are not to conduct a scientific evaluation of the theory advanced by the Bogdanov, but a social experiment about manipulation of the masses and of evidences, as it is described in the web site which links are available in my column. Another link show what Voyer and YBM did to 2 other writers, a man ans a woman, previously to that affair, and show that he used of exactly the same tool as for this one, and that he stopped doing it when he begin to take care of the Bogdanovs affair. He is insulting the writters abondantly and even show the cover of their books with the title """"de la merde!"""" made in such a way to appear like if it was its real title.
I would like you to come forword with prove that I edited somebody text 'cause I dont see any.
As for your 2 texts above I do not see what is the problem with them so explain yourself.
What do you mean by threat? what kind of threat?
I do read on YBM column a threat to get me banished and a threat to get me ignored and a threat to deleete all my texts no matter what I write with links to wiki revert function, which is illegal by wikis rules, and a threat to get presented as a vandaliser of the site with a link to do it, even so I did not have written a word about it.
What do you mean I am not talking about the subject? Where?
I am firmly keeping the subject: there is no error what so ever in the Bogdanovs book and in their thesis, there is no attempt on their part at lying or at making a bluff out of science, there is people who pretend to be what they are not and pretend to detain evidences of something they barely understand, and who constantly insult the Bogdanovs and anyone who do not have the same opi8nion as they have, who insult the Bogdanovs famili, teachers, physical appearence, life, friends, constantly and in many forum of the internet.
This person is YBM and his associate are: Romnulphe, Voyer, rayon-z, and Max, and their name are to be followed every time YBM appear on a site about the subject.
There is plenty of links about it.
The Bogdanov have already discussed and rediscussed each and every point of the list of so called errors presented by those pseudo scientist, and have proven them wrong and other scientist have intervene too to explain how it had to be understood in theoretical physic, but yBm keep using them as if Igor had never argumented against it, and even do it in a way as if it was because he couldn't argue against it, even a fiew blog after he had got an all explaination about it.
It just doesn't make sens.
He always provocate people by personnal attacks and then reproach them to don't stick to the subject.
Thats a clear line in all his appearences on the net.
A specialist in theoritical science has once demonstrate to him how it hang together and explained each of the points he had listed, but even with that who was a perfect demonstration, he answered: I don't give a shit about it, and even if you prove me wrong on all points, I will continue anyway! he says that on fr. physic, and i put the link to it here and on the french wiki about the bogdanovs.
Of course, if someone has decided that no matter what they will continue to attack you, even prooven wro",0.0

I tried making some improvements, but I left the issue along about the quote from Chase.

I agree that the quote absolutely cannot be included without clear statements afterwards showing that he was wrong, but that is hard to do without looking like you're dragging him through the mud. The quotation should not be excluded either because Chase's statements are themselves so noteworthy that they need to be included as a follow up to the story of Jensen, and evidence of the continued attitude of the group that followed Jensen.

 Replaceable fair use Image:Elaine Tan Eastenders fancard.jpg 

Thanks for uploading Image:Elaine Tan Eastenders fancard.jpg. I notice the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under fair use, but its use in Wikipedia articles fails our first fair use criterion in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed image could reasonably be found or created that provides substantially the same information. If you believe this image is not replaceable, please:

 Go to the image description page and edit it to add , without deleting the original Replaceable fair use template.
 On the image discussion page, write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all.

Alternatively, you can also choose to replace the fair use image by finding a freely licensed image of its subject, requesting that the copyright holder release this (or a similar) image under a free license, or by taking a picture of it yourself.

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified how these images fully satisfy our fair use criteria.

Notability of Matthew rizzotti
A tag has been placed on Matthew rizzotti requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

Question about Edit

Where is the proper place to put forth an individual and allow his talents to be fully utilized? Would you suggest I use the edited text as the basis for an RFA? Surely any poly-degreed Oxforder with 18,000 edits in 22 months can be, indeed is, a formidable Wikipedian exerting a vast influence on the quality and tone of the project. Here is the meat of the text - I would appreciate any guidance you might be willing to offer:

I think this project could possibly use the help of the Editor . He has not one, but Two, degrees from Oxford - has written several books [Love Songs and Other Mysteries (1991) - Bad Choice (1989) - Sorry, No ISBN numbers exist to link to ...] and has made just a hair under Eighteen Thousand edits in 22 months at Wiki. 

As he has frequently invoked the """"Superior Authority"""" of his multiple Oxford degrees and education and on numerous occasions brandished his Oxon academic honors to defend and enshrine his edits in Wikipedia and to eliminate the need for discussion, perhaps he could be of some use here - building the entry for his alma mater. Surely an American 'emergency responder', author, 18,000 count wiki Editor, and pedigreed intellectual with the rare accomplishment of two Oxford post graduate degrees would be of special use to the project.  

""""With respect, I went to Oxford, so i am fairly well aware of Brit English...penultimate being the climax of the story."""" - Arcayne

""""Regarding the 'penultimate' stuff - not worries - as I said, it's just a word. I always thought is was used as next to the end, as in right before the ending. A slightly different meaning has become popular, like how the original phrase """"buck naked"""" (meaning, naked as a male deer) becoming mispronounced so often that now people say """"butt-naked"""". It would render me a crabby old man to decry the loss of the word meanings. It was also make me something of a jerk. Words evolve. - Arcayne  14:34, 3 July 2008""""

""""I did attend Oxford. I did graduate from there with the two degrees I have previously noted"""" - Arcayne

These are the two degrees Arcayne previously noted:
the EU is not a single nation, nor is the UN or UAE. They are actually something called NGO's, or non-governmental organizations.  - Arcayne
 The EU is nothing BUT a governmental organization. Its purpose is to politically unite the countries within the European Community. ... it is a united entity. Ditto the UAE. Kapowow 
Are you seriously trying to suggest that the EU is not an NGO? ... If you consider me throwing my political science and international relations degrees at you to be derogatory, then I have to say that I am sorry you feel that way. I am not a potted plant; I know the policies of which I speak,' ... - Arcayne'''

I trust the Project will be the better, as has Wikipedia in general, with such a confident and industrious Oxonian on board.

Surely Wikipedia, or the Oxford community, have a place for those such as Arcayne, who are able to place 18,000 edits in 22 months as the very public face of Oxford Wikipedians.75.57.205.135  """,0.0

They're barred from high government positions, diplomatic service and the military, as well as from many state benefits. Universities have quotas for Coptic students considerably lower than their actual percentage within the population.Building new churches isn't allowed, and the old ones are falling into disrepair thanks to a lack both of money and authorization to renovate. When girls are kidnapped and forcibly converted, the police don't intervene. Thousands of pigs were also slaughtered under the pretense of confining swine flu. Naturally all were owned by Christians.

 Citation analysis consistent with the critique of the IP editor 

I have no longstanding or longterm interest in contributing to the quality of the article, but have a strong interest in seeing broad, general improvements in the sourcing of scientific articles—including those in the common space between social and biological sciences. And I have an interest in seeing IP editors treated well, by the majority of us, not the few.

The recent visiting IP editor was so set upon by more experienced editors that I thought I would perform a first-pass (rough draft) evaluation of this article, strictly from the perspective of evaluating its sources.

The goals in doing this are three:
(1) To allow us to come to consensus as to the quality of the article, at least in terms of verifiable information (though for this scientist, and for purists such as myself and NeilN, it is likely that if sources should come out, content must also);
(2) To identify patterns of problems, so particular individuals with time and desire might address them (e.g., incomplete therefore unverifiable entries, poor specific sources for particular blocks of information, varyingly formatted similar sources and repeat sources making source followup difficult, etc.), and 
(3) To create a list of first issues to address, so that there might be a common set of priorities (i.e., where the list below might, in months to come, be sprinkled with  markers).

In doing this, I am applying the same academic standards as I might have in reviewing a paper submission from a sixth form or older student, on into university. This is the sort of thing that, while scholarly (so we might each might differ on the details of the analysis), all might agree to the trends represented (and all might have arrived at the same perception within minutes reviewing the article references, and have accomplished a full first-pass evaluation in an hour or so.) That is, we can see for ourselves, instead of taking the a priori position that all is fine enough to remain, or insisting a new editor argue her or his case, thoroughly and decisively, to more seasoned Wikipedia hands.

After having done this evaluation, I have come to the conclusion that the article weaknesses referred to by the IP editor appear to be substantiated. From the persecutive of reliability of information, based on expectation of high quality and verifiable secondary sources suited to the content, I conclude that the article is in very poor condition.

After reviewing this summary of the state of this article's sources, see if you might not agree.

Here, in bullet form, are cogent observations from the evaluation of the article's sourcing:

 >70 references to 12 or more undergraduate textbooks as sources, rather than the scholarly secondary or tertiary sources drawn upon by those texts (see more below);

 >70 references to books that appear without page numbers—King 2008 and King 2009 (47 refs), Buss, Crain (5), Boccadoro (2), Fausto-Sterling, Rathus (3), Russon, Farrell, Coon (2), Escoffier, Al-islam.org, Stearns Major Patterns, Stearns Sexuality (6), Greene;

 47 (36 plus 11) references to the same undergraduate textbook (King, 2008 and 2009), in two entries, all appearing without page numbers;

 More than a half dozen books lacking full citations, particularly, date of publication (e.g., King, Buss, Stearns Major Patterns, Stearns Sexuality), but also, other obscured details (e.g., David Weeks, Secrets of the Superyoung. Berkley., is actually D, Weeks & J. James, 1999, Secrets of the superyoung: The scientific reasons some people look ten years younger than they really are and how you can, too"""", New York:Villard Books, etc.)

 Long articles (> 20 pp) without narrowing part of article sourced via Section name or page number (e.g., Ross, Freud, Nagel, Lee et al, CDC);

 Nonsense page references (e.g., Kim & Ward);

 Many bare URLs or URL-only citations without links (find articles.com, enotes.com, TheAge.com.au, etc.);

 Multiple (>8) references to dead links (facts.org, psychnews.psychiatryonline.org, eehow.com, etc.);

 Many egregiously inappropriate web-based sources, including innerbody.com, about.com, essortment.com, howstuffworks.com (!), proplusmedical.com (male enhancement sales page!), eehow.com, TheAge.com.au, etc.;

 Words and their meaning 

Like your confusion over the meaning of """"homophobia"""", Bugs, you've shown by your comments about """"homicide"""" on WP:ANI that you don't seem to understand how the English language actually works.

The most obvious thing is to point out that prefixes and suffixes (like """"homo/homi"""" and """"cide"""") are NOT governed by fixed rules maintained by some authority. Secondly, even given generally observed rules as to the meanings of certain prefixes and suffixes, actual usage  whether intentional on the part of the coiner, definitional drift, or simply by being idioms  determines actual meanings. Finally, for actual legal terms, those ARE given specific definitions which may or may not match """"logical"""" combinations, your impressions, or even popular usage. For the last one, I'll point you to the Cornell University School of Law:

Homicide is when one human being causes the death of another. Not all homicide is murder, as some killings are manslaughter, and some are lawful, such as when justified by an affirmative defense, like insanity or self-defense.

"== Some Main Mechanisms for Transitional Justice in Burma ==

By Aung Thiha

What is transitional justice? Before we talk about some main mechanisms for transitional justice for future Burma, we are supposed to know what transitional justice is. It is mainly subject to the human rights abuses in the past. The most important thing is to search for a justice for both victims and perpetrators involved in the past without any bias. Therefore, we are supposed to find appropriate ways to help those who had seriously suffered from human rights abuses in the past. It is also important to handle those who committed the human rights abuses in the past in appropriate ways. We have to find the truth from both victims and perpetrators without taking sides. It is unquestionable that both opposition groups and military generals have hardliners. For instance, U Kyi Maung, who is one of the members of the National League of Democracy (NLD), used to answer the question made by journalists, saying that they were going to establish international military tribunals like the ones in Germany (8th August 1945) and to try military generals who committed the crimes in the past. It was really a threat for the military generals who are afraid of prosecution. As a result, it can lead to internecine circumstances. 

In relation to the transitional justice in Burma, we consider some main mechanisms to create justice in transitional period. First, in advance we have to investigate the details as to the violations of human rights committed by the military regime in the past so as to become aware of when, where and how they happen. The investigation can include individuals or institutions involved in the past human rights abuses. There can be a lot of obstacles or delay in investigating the abuses. We can also get tangible information from the government files, mass graves and testimonies. For instance, we can investigate the abuses by uncovering the mass graves carried out by the Burmese army in the jungle and by identifying the bodies; who they were, how and when they were executed. It will be very helpful for us to do something against the perpetrators during the transitional period. We also have to make sure that we share information collected with the public so that they can help follow the cases. 

Second, regarding to the prosecution we are still undecided whether we are supposed to offer an amnesty to the military generals, or we ought to try them at the international military tribunal like in Germany. Actually, what the military generals fear most is a prosecution. If we prosecute them, the circle of retaliation against each other will not be able to end, but will also delay of transferring political power to the opposition parties or the obstruction of Burma’s political progress. As a consequence, the civilians will be victims again. Furthermore, prosecution against the military generals is irrelevant to the current political situation in Burma. It is not realistic. On the other hand, if we forgive the generals for their abuses and offer an amnesty to them with a view to the development of the country as a whole, it seems to ignore or overlook the people who had suffered from severe human rights abuses in the past. They will not be satisfied with us in power, and we will lack credibility. In some cases, we find it difficult to prosecute the perpetrators because they, at the same time, are both perpetrators and victims (e.g child soldiers who are forcibly recruited by the SPDC). It is not always possible to regard them as criminals. Therefore, both sides are supposed to think about the whole circumstance and try to negotiate the issues for the sake of the whole country and its people rather than focusing on obtaining political power or personal feelings. It is also important to try to reduce grievances being rooted in both sides. Prosecuting the military generals is not a good solution for the group in power in the long term.  

Third, in the transitional period we can also use civil sanction against those who were involved in the human rights abuses in the past. As I already mentioned, by letting people look at the files that include the details of past human rights abuses, they can distinguish the victims and perpetrators. Then, they can prevent anyone who they think were supporters or collaborators in the past human rights abuses from being involved in future political role by means of demonstration. By not allowing the supporters or collaborators involved in the past human rights abuses to be involved in future politics, we also have to show that we respect the dignity of the people and do not overlook or ignore their sufferings from the past. 

Fourth, reparation also creates the justice for those who had suffered from severe human rights abuses in the past. For instance, in Germany the government compens",0.0

 from Sarasota, Florida is the evilest person on the Wikipedia because they are making life for Scott A Brown hard with the evil tvnewstalk.net and their evil pack of seven which is the great supporter of the evil spotteddogsdotorg who did not give Scott A Brown the WCAU as CBS tape as promised with the help of the evil Roy Leep. Scott A Brown, better known as spotteddogsdotorg on the Wikipedia because Scott A Brown wanted to make revenge on the evil spotteddogsdotorg who did not give Scott A Brown the WCAU as CBS tape which would have let Scott A Brown relive those good days so Scott A Brown made Wikipedia vandalism accounts to make the evil spotteddogsdotorg look evil on the Wikipedia.

 Article in need of improvement

concerns a """"tunnel experiment,"""" as proposed by Galileo in his Dialogo.

The article would clearly benefit by having it pointed out that, although it could be, the experiment has as yet not been performed. In its original form the idea is to have a tunnel dug through the Earth so that a test object (""""cannonball"""") can be dropped into it. This is, of course, impossible. But the same physical principles would be revealed by using laboratory-sized massive bodies instead. The experiment could be performed in an Earth-based laboratory or in an orbiting satellite.

The primary goal of the case based textbook is to inform doctors of what to do when they are asked to perform different medical operations. The case based textbook only has one chapter on circumcision. Its primary goal is to inform doctors of how to react in the case they are asked to perform a circumcision. It does not give an overview of questions that have been raised about the procedure, and doesn't cover sources of controversy in the medical field (only debates). This makes it unfit to speak for this topic. Maybe it would be better to use it to highlight another statement involving controversies in the medical field.

The second source titled Controversies with one author is ok, as it does go over some medical controversies that exist, notably in consent and the parental role.

I think a better sourcing for this statement """"Ethical and legal questions regarding informed consent and autonomy have been raised over non-therapeutic neonatal circumcision.[8][9]"""" would be one that highlights significant questions from community groups in a specific demographic. If we could get a source that is clearly indicating that these questions are being raised that would be better.

"I noticed that Rob now added a notification on original research or verification. This is better than simply removing the text, but there remains a confusion. You all must distinguish me (1) as a scientist who for you is a third party and who provides sources, e.g. see me as the writer of VTFD in 2001, (b) as a scientist who helps you, just now, to get this article straight. You should note that the verifiability condition concerns facts that need be checked by various sources. But the text that I provided (in the disputed criticism section) contains a reasoned argument that you can check by the logical faculties of your minds. Thus the condition does not apply in that sense. Also the reference to original research doesn't apply, since I didn't enter original research. The research originated in 1990 and was published in 2001. The only thing I do now is correct the misleading element in the article, and provide the reader (and you as editors) with a condensed reasoned statement, that you again can check by using the logical faculties of your minds. Also, the verifiability page mentions that the sources should be unreliable. Well, again this is a non-issue for this paragraph. For, the point is that a reasoned argument is provided, so that it doesn't matter where it is from, and you have to use the faculties of your minds. If the washing lady says 1+1=2 then this has the same value as when the bishop says so, even when the bishop doesn't know what he talks about. Which is exactly why I added the suggestion, above, that when the reasoned argument is understood, the criticism might perhaps best be included in the main text, revising the main article. I didn't do that myself, since all of you would be completely shocked, not having digested that reasoned statement. Some other comments: PM 1: I doubt whether you will find many other sources on criticism other then I already included in the list of literature in the links that I provided. If someone feels like unpacking those links and transferring those references into the main body, feel free to do so. PM 2: Now that Rob has eliminated that one sentence, that he agreed was nonsense, perhaps the header Criticism is too strong, and it may be perhaps Evaluation or something like that. PM 3: If the consensus is that this group of editors cannot take responsibility for using their logical faculties of minds on the reasoned argument, then you may also attribute it to me, see Colignatus at wikinfo, and perhaps research a bit how reliable I am. Simply a Google scolar is not enough, though.

Can you please talk with user and if nothing else discover his knowledge of hungarian language so that we can know if this is Toroko or somebody else ? Rjecina (talk) ''
I am disruptive because I do not hide some facts that you don't feel good about?
What is this? We agree on how we present history so that everybody is happy? Is this what this is all about? Excuse me for being so outraged by it should be the other way around! I see this bullshit that Union with Hungary ended in 1526. Then Croatia was a totally autonomous part of Austria-Hungary. Then Croatia was in union with Hungary 1102-1526 and then in union with Austria 1526-1918. Also, Kingdom of Hungary and the Lands of St. Stephen were different states.

If I provide reference for the other academic viewpoint in a disputed statement, then it gets deleted. 
Though, interestingly enough the other references that support the other viewpoint are not deleted. They remain there!? Is this what you guys think about writing an Encyclopedia? I know that the sources I provided didn't confirm the view that Croatia was an idependent state. But that's why I added them to list them beside the sources that say it was in personal union.

I only noticed one obvious error in the numbers, that is the sentence(s) """"Lägren hade då totalt 382 besättningsmedlemmar från kvarstadsbåtarna"""" and """"Leiren hadde da totalt 382 besetningsmedlemmer fra kvarstadbåtene"""", where the number 382 conflicts with other numbers given. It is correct that the cited source gives this number, but it has to be either a misprint or meant to include more. The book  gives a good overview of the (number of) prisoners and what happened to them.

 3RR warning 

Three times today (28 Oct.) you have reverted the """"sinusoids"""" language to your preferred """"trigonometric functions"""" language, as I've tried various things to explain, reference, talk about it, etc.  Please engage rather than just reverting.  If you revert again, I'll report you for 3RR violation again.  

Neither you nor I are experts in the article subject matter (least squares spectral analysis). But I cited 2 references that literally say """"trigonometric functions"""", while your references all refer to another method (Fourier analysis) you freely interpret as to make it sound they refer to the article subject matter, though it is obvious they do not (in your mind, as you claimed it explicitly, Fourier analysis is still the same as least-squares spectral analysis, which is obviously a nonsense because WP has two completely separate articles both featured on WP main page btw).  So I do not believe anyone any more will buy your misusing of Wikipedia regulations. There is no reversals here, not even technically speaking; because what is going on is mine (article author’s) cleaning of all the shit you keep spraying around. Just like so many editors noted (everyone just look at Dicklyon’s talk page) that you engaged in edit wars or insults exchanges with so far. You are just a trouble maker around here and everyone sees you as such. Now stuff your imaginative misinterpretations of WP regulations to where they belong.  No 3RR violation on my part. But I know why you just threatened with reporting me: it is because I already mentioned to you today that you are in violation of 3RR yourself. """"Sinusoids"""" is another result of your imagination as NO REFERENCE ON LSSA EVER MENTIONS IT, so it is not a reversal to remove your ignorance, cleaning your shit is what it is.

 Israeli art students 

Thanks, Umeboshi! Yes, it has surprised me how quick on the draw (and vituperative) some folks have been in expunging any reference to the alleged/purported/apparent Israeli espionage. As happens in other contexts, I think some people conflate criticism of Israel with anti-semitism  or conflate this intentionally. The ironic thing is that if all this stuff is true (as seems at least worth serious consideration), it even reflects well on Israel, as there is evidence Israel warned the US that something big was coming. All countries spy; to me, that's not such a big deal. I just want to know about it in this particular case, and feel annoyed when any discussion is stifled """"with extreme prejudice.""""

 Edits proposed to plot description 

""""“Joliet” Jake Blues is released from the Joliet Correctional Center after serving three years of a prison sentence after being convicted of armed robbery.""""

Entry for Joliet Correctional Center.

""""Jake is irritated at being picked up by his brother Elwood in a battered former Mt. Prospect, Illinois police car, instead of the Cadillac The Blues Brothers used to own.""""

It's unclear here, however the Caddy Jake refers to may be Murph and the Magictones' pink vehicle first seen in the """"Howard Johnson's"""" scene where Jake and Elwood phone Maury Sline and are blasted the flame-throwing mystery woman. 

The Blues Brothers visit their childhood home, a Roman Catholic orphanage, Saint Helen-of-the-Blessed-Shroud Orphanage. From Sister Mary Stigmata (Kathleen Freeman), The Blues Brothers learn that a property tax lien on the orphanage property will be foreclosed upon unless five thousand dollars in property taxes is remitted on its behalf to the county (the associated church has elected instead to sell the building to the Board of Education rather than pay the tax assessment).

Part of the film's humour is the actual name of the orphanage. Credit to Kathleen Freeman. People erroneously thing charities and churches are completely tax-exempt; however the exemption most notably only extends to Federal income taxes. The property tax bill would probably have remained an unforeclosed lien had the church not decided to sell voluntarily to the Board of Education.

""""At the advice of their childhood mentor, Curtis (Cab Calloway), The Blues Brothers attend an evangelical church service at Triple Rock Baptist Church, led by the Reverend Cleophus James (James Brown), where Jake has an epiphany: The Blues Brothers can legitimately raise the funds by re-forming their rhythm and blues band, The Blues Brothers’ Show Band and Revue.""""

Credit to Cab Calloway and James Brown.
  
""""As The Blues Brothers drive past a doughnut shop and Nelson Funeral Home in the Bluesmobile, Elwood’s driving alerts two Illinois State Police troopers, Trooper Daniel (Armand Cerami) and Trooper Mount (Steven Williams), who, after pursuing The Blues Brothers into a quiet, secluded residential area, learn from their in-car SCMODS (State-County-Municipal Offender Data System) computer terminal of Elwood’s suspended driver's license. When Trooper Daniel and Trooper Mount attempt to place Elwood under arrest, Elwood speeds off, escaping by driving and crashing through, with the Illinois State Troopers in pursuit, the Dixie Square Mall.""""

Entry for Bluesmobile; since location in Chicago and Illinois is obviously a major plot element, reference that the particular law-enforcement agency here is the ISP; SCMODS article already exists, with explanation of the meaning, in this context; article exists for Dixie Square Mall. 

""""After parking the Bluesmobile in an alley-end compartment next to a high-voltage transformer (hence the Bluesmobile’s remarkable magical abilities) and arriving at Elwood’s home, a hotel for transients, The Blues Brothers are mysteriously unharmed from a bazooka attack launched by a mystery woman (Carrie Fisher).""""

Credit cast member Carrie Fisher; this scene is cut from many televised versions, DVD featurette commentary explains that Canadian actor Aykroyd felt this scene explained the Bluesmobile's magical abilities, yet director Landis felt this was not transparent.

""""The next morning, just as the Illinois State Troopers who attempted to arrest Elwood the previous evening, with the help of Parole officer Burton Mercer (John Candy) as to the true address of “the elegant abode of one Elwood Blues” (because Elwood had ‘falsified his renewal’ and ‘put down ten sixty West Addison’, the street address of Wrigley Field) attempt to serve an arrest warrant at Elwood’s tiny room. The mystery woman detonates a bomb that demolishes the building, which inadvertently saves The Blue Brothers from another attempted arrest.""""

Candy's character was important because he assisted in locating Elwood's abode; the 'Wrigley Field bit' is important plot-element humor.

""""Elwood proceeds to his “straight job”, on the assembly line at an aerosol-can manufacturer, takes several cans from the line and places them in his briefcase, and visits the plant manager, quitting his job, citing a decision to become a priest (curiously, Elwood’s supervisor’s office is adorned with a U.S. flag and an Illinois state flag, suggesting that the aerosol-can manufacturer in an enterprise owned by the government of the State of Illinois—or else simply that Elwood’s supervisor thought it would be cool to adorn his office with",0.0

Faith?
Faith can mean 'complete confidence in a person or plan, etc.' Faith can also mean 'Belief that does not rest on logical proof or material evidence'. When a theist speaks of his faith, it is argued, he refers to the latter definitions. When he wishes to assert that """"atheists have faith, too"""", the only definition that fits is the first[citation needed], but his argument implies the latter definitions, nonetheless (see equivocation).

Quite often theists have used the argument that life occurring from no life is highly improbable to the point of near impossibility. This is also the case with many of the """"proofs"""" of God such as those by Thomas Aquinas, which would also be more in line with the latter than the former.  Now while they may be wrong in their assumptions to come to the conclusion of the probability of life or the existence of God, what they are speaking about would be more in line with the latter definition that the former in their argument.  The validity of what they are saying does not impact what they """"wish to assert"""", so they may indeed be asserting both points at the same time. Perhaps a qualifier such as under a purely theological perspective would improve this paragraph.  Or change to """"the definition that usually fits within context(the only definition that fits) is the first"""".

I am not taking issue with the fact that you are removing a language from the page and replacing the """"languages"""" blurb with an """"administrative languages"""" blurb. What constitutes vandalism is the repeated removal of large sections of text- multiple paragraphs at a time- from sections such as """"Background"""". Furthermore, it would be more appropriate to move the two languages you continue to cite to an """"Administrative Languages"""" blurb, and include the rest of the languages beneath that in a blurb called, """"Other Languages"""", or something to that effect.

Describing ID as pseudoscience is only pejorative in so far as ID claims to be a science.  That is the way it is used in the lede and the way it is used in the sources.

"Endless edit/revert cycling on Half Dome
Dear anonymous editor: you are adding material to the Half Dome article that does not follow the guidelines for Wikipedia editing, hence is constantly being reverted. It doesn't matter that you believe going off the cables is safer. It does not matter that Will and I believe this to be false. The important thing about Wikipedia is that the articles are verifiable (that is, any fact can be traced to a reliable source, such as a book or newspaper), and written in a neutral point of view (i.e., does not favor a particular set of opinions).

If you wish to have your material stay in the Half Dome article, you have to come up with a reference that states that it is safer off the cables - you cannot rely on your own knowledge or intuition: you have to prove it to the rest of us. Further, if it is a controversial assertion (which this one is), then you need to phrase it as such. For example, if some association is favoring leaving the cables, then we could add:

Association X claims that leaving the cable is safer than waiting, while the National Park Service wants people to stay on the cable for safety.

Notice that this sort of phrasing does not talk about the absolute truth of whether it is safer or not: it reports who believes it to be safer and who does not. These should be official organizations or well-known experts - we can't cite random people in blogs, for example. Again, both of these assertions should be backed up with references. We can help you format the references, don't worry.

I would urge you to find a reputable source that recommends leaving the cables. Until you do so, I predict that the unsourced assertion is so controversial that it will probably just be reverted on sight.

Although Ken Barnes is a fucking moron, we need more criticism to balance it out
Hi, As one of the primary authors of this page, I want to make it absolutely clear that I in no way agree with the ridiculous statements made in the citation I added from """"rock critic"""" Ken Barnes. Having contributed nothing to music himself, it is outrageous that he would have the nerve to attack what is arguably the greatest Queen album. Nonetheless, we need criticism as well in order to better balance the article out. I have also added many wonderful things lately, such as Freddie's top listings in international polls, so don't worry too much. I also want to make it clear that, although I cite """"Rolling Stone"""" a lot, I basically consider it to be a magazine for people who are musically illiterate. Forgive me, Freddie!

Hello. Please see Wikipedia:Manual of Style (Japan-related articles) to learn more about the standard used by Wikipedia.

For instance, working links to Shakujii castle and Shakujii River become broken links after you change them to Shakuji'i castle and Shakuji'i River in error. It is worse when you changed filenames of pictures and caused them to be deleted from the system.
