"""Saab lofton was a radio personality for about two months of his before loosing his show on digital radio network. He will not provide proof of his comic roofis (as in did he actuall draw it himself or did he contract out the work while writing the storie. Both of his books (pamplets) are home published and could be considered very racist! This is not someone that has any creditibily as he has lied several times on his wikipedia page.

No RESULTS!
On June 12th, 2008 GLOBETREKER says:
This is not an example and cannot be proven that YOU actually drew THE strip.

Like I said I have been informed this comic in nothing more than 2 or 3 sheets of zerox paper stapled together. Not in the usual format as a printed affair. He uses the term loosely since it’s not a real printed comic. He has no examples of his drawing, what kind of cartoonist doesn’t put their work online. PROVE THAT SHIT!

He stated in this post to Wikipedia that his book Battle Neverending’s 3 thousand copies sold out in one year which is a total lie. He printed them in 1998 and was still selling them as recent as 2006

http://www.popocculture.com/28/battle-neverending-by-saab-l

“Jarvis Marlow is the man who paid out of his own pocket for the second printing (one thousand copies) and third printing (two thousand copies) of Battle Neverending. I sold all three thousand copies of Btl Nvrg within the span of a year”. 

(Example #1 of his lies)

2000 copies of A.D. supposedly sold in one year or as Saab states (Record Time) which is also unverifiable whether it actually sold that fast since he out an out lied about Battle Neverendings.
The first A.D. was published by a small defunct anarchist publisher which describes itself as publishing """"pamphlets"""", sold out and was not reprinted.

“However, his claim to fame is the novel he wrote while still in the dorms at San Francisco State University, A.D., which was so radical a book it got him kicked out of college in 1997.”

When in reality

“Lofton wrote """"A.D."""" while a student at San Francisco State University and spent so much time hawking the book when it was published three years ago that his grades began to fall and the university cut off his financial aid”.

(Example #2 of his lies)

I ‘m not admitting any mistake about BERKELEY (you always want to appear very radical so I’m sure you told him you were homeless on the streets of Berkeley) because you made that up as well as being homeless! The only place you’ve been homeless was on your mothers couch for THREE YEARS ALL THE WHILE REFUSING TO WORK A DAY JOB, IM SURE TO YOUR MOTHERS AMAZEMENT ON JUST HOW MUCH OF A BUM HER SON TURNED OUT TO BE!

(Example #3 of his lies)

“In all the WEEKS you've been STALKING me, NOT ONE motherfucker has so much as e-mailed me and asked, """"is this anonymous, psuedonym-using piece of shit correct about anything?""""”.

I know nobody reads your shit anyway so I wouldn’t expect any response. I write these things simply because I know that you can’t handle risking your supposed fame! (Which is all you are interested in anyway). Your not an activist you’re an opportunist masking yourself in anarchy.

And finally I have this victory over your Racist Spoiled Black Privileged ass!

Here’s the dialog about shutting Saabs Wikepedia page because firstly it’s chalked full of made up shit and secondly they finally realize that he’s just another home publishing hack!

I've looked into the books listed in the bibliography... The first was published by a small defunct anarchist publisher which describes itself as publishing """"pamphlets"""", sold out and was not reprinted. The second was described by Pop Occulture Magazine as """"obviously a low-budget and quite-possibly home-printed affair"""". There is no evidence that either of these books received a credible review, much less meet WP:BOOK. Journalists are a dime-a-dozen and not automatically notable, and these books don't appear to establish notability either.

Therefore I am proposing deletion of the article. If the tag is remove, would someone please nominate for deletion? I can't as I can't create the deletion page... 67.67.219.223 (talk) 

I'll keep an eye on it. I also find it a little hard to believe that he was kicked out of San Francisco State for writing a novel that was """"too radical."""" -) Steve Dufour (talk) 
I went looking for sources, didn't find any, agreed with proposed deletion. phoebe / (talk to me)

Recent photos of Zimmerman shortly after the shooting made by the police show no blood spatter on his front including his shirt.  His account claims that Martin was directly over him when he shot him.  Yet a 9mm hollow point wound in Martin's front chest would be expected to shower blood all over Zimmerman.  This evidence clearly contradicts Zimmerman's account.  Another report indicates that the shot was fired from more than 18 inches away.  This contrary evidence and contradiction in Zimmerman's story should be noted in this wiki article.  Speculation is that Zimmerman achieved standing (off the ground from a lying down position) status after Martin's struggled with him and then shot him with his 9mm as payback for the beating upon himself which he had apparently initiated.

I removed the importance banner from the Dade Behring entry because I was editing the article.  The only reason that I even started the article is because the company is mentioned in the Emil Adolf von Behring article and I thought that people who read his entry may be interested in the company.  I dont have the time to sit down and write the whole entry so I put up the incomplete banner.  When I read the importance banner and the page that goes with it(that says:""""This Wikipedia article or category is currently inactive and is kept primarily for historical interest."""") I thought that since I was going to edit the article, the banner could come down.  In the next few days I will closely read up on Notability and edit or remove the article.  Thanks for your input.

"David, I have a couple of questions regarding your last edit to Skene's glands. Basically, the article matched the given references better before your edit. Did you work off of some other reference?  03:35 Jan 11, 2003 (UTC)

Feel free to discuss your questions directly with me by email if you like (wiki lets you do this by clicking a link). I used a variety of references obtained via Google, which I did not list in the article (I probably should have).

I have doubts about some of the information that was there before my changes and that you have restored. In particular, I believe that Skene's glands are not the same as the G-spot, and are not located there. However, stimulation of the G-spot can cause female ejaculation, which generates fluid from the Skene's glands (among other tissues).

By the way, your contributions to Wikipedia are impressive.

 I disagree that """"[you] set our own social norms by concensus [sic]"""".  ([you], meaning the community, not Heironymous).  I agree that there appears to be such a rule, or your claimed practice, but in my experience 'consensus' is honored far more in the breach than the actual observance.  Indeed, one of my repeated criticisms against Dodo was the fact that he certainly didn't wait for any sort of 'consensus' to develop, and in fact he directly prevented such a consensus simply by reverting in minutes or hours, rather than allowing that consensus to develop.  I think, instead, the 'consensus' claim is primarily used in order to attack, rather then to defend.  In one posting, for example, Dodo actually claimed that I hadn't obtained a 'consensus' that would allow me to make an edit!  (I have never seen any other person make such a weird claim, but on the other hand I haven't seen anybody criticize Dodo for that obvious gaffe.)  I viewed that comment as borderline-nuts, and I have seen no indication that any other poster has taken the reasonable position that: Dodo has, himself, repeatedly violated the rules that WP is claimed to be operating under.  
Do I believe that the average WP user goose-steps?  No, I think it's much more likely (see above)that posters tend to be self-motivated, and 'control-freaks' are powerfully-motivated to maintain an actual practice which is very different than is claimed by 'rule' or ostensible practice.  If I had more time, I'd see if I could see statistics on the persons who have posted here:  How many edits?  How many reverts?  Etc.  I feel certain a pattern is present.

"Thanks for getting back to me. Like on many pages, a consensus will never form, unless people who have a fairly objective take on affairs decide to leave the page to the POV pushers. This page, like many pages of strong national interest to certain users, will forever be a battleground. I'm sure you've seen it elsewhere as well  there is a cadre of users who post on one topic only, and large numbers of them congregate around a topic of interest. They post a certain perspective on the topic, and basically exert ownership over the topic. People who come in and see what might be considered to be bias, and try to change the page, are quickly overwhelmed. Even when they are not, and achieve some sort of compromise after a long struggle, sooner or later a new account will arrive and undo the consensus.  This is exactly what happened here. (Of course, it's even worse when two interest groups who are hostile to each other try to gain control of a topic of interest  then it's world war III!  I'm sure you've seen that too.)

This is what has happened on this page and others relating to pre-Islamic Iran, a topic of considerable passion to many Iranian emigres in particular.  Many of the users who post regularly on these topics post about Iranian topics, and Iranian topics only.  It is an uphill battle to get some of the evident POV bias removed, and when it is, surely enough, along comes a new account do undo the cease fire.

 my responses to Bishonen are indented with a *
 I had to fight hard for it, but I don't believe I am being ganged up now. I am being taken seriously now and not insulted.
 It was your attitude towards me that did and still bothers me.
 I am NOT asking you to go to these editors and intervene at this point. It will only stir up antagonism, where now we have peace. Obviously, this is your decision. I'm just stating that it's not my wish.
 Will you please sign your comments, at least somewhere?
 You accused me of trolling, too, a word whose meaning I had to ask my 18 year old son. All I can say is, I believe you got what you deserved when you interfered in this whole thing. I know you're an adminstrator now, and it doesn't impress me.
 I can and do accuse you of [[pa[trolling.]] like a [[Nazi][storm trooper]].

Dear Bishonon

questions: 

Is there any excuse for how they treated me and other newcomers, or anyone that questions them?

I can't answer questions without any information in them, sorry. You'll have to link me to some of the posts from these users that you're complaining about. I'd appreciate diff links, but I realize you're new and may have trouble making them. But at least tell me the page, the date, and the time.

 I find this statement fascinating in light of your assertions (below). 
 You have obviously looked around on some of the article edits in question. Why didn't you look at anything else? If you knew where to look at edits on the Dem Party article, I would assume you would know where to look for our dialogues.
 You keep making accusations at me and then state that you know nothing about the situation. This is hilarious.

 just some page dates and times:

 http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Thewolfstar&redirect;=no 1.1 - 1.7

 concerning the Democratic Party (United States) article: Please be advised, though, that I can't undertake to comment in any depth at all on the content of the articles about American politics that I see you editing. I don't know much about the subject, and few of the names in the articles mean anything to me. That said, I expect I can recognize what you call """"how they treated you"""", """"ganging up"""", etc, if I see it. A sincere thank you for that (recognize ganging up).

 I wasn't asking for that exactly. But now that you mention it, if you don't know much about American politics I don't think you should be getting involved in my edits concerning American politics. The article reads, for the most part like a giant advertisement for the Democratic Party. It's improving now because I stood up to these...yes.. bullies.

 The editors have been making this article less biased due to my edits and my arguments
 See the differences in the article since I joined in this debate and edit war. Though, I guess you wouldn't understand any of the dsicussion.

Is there any excuse for their ganging up on, and even gathering people for the express purpose of ganging up on one person, particularly a newcomer to Wikipedia?Same''.

"""

 This is an interesting discussion with good points made by all. I can add a little bit that might be helpful. As mentioned by the editors above the dictionay definition and a legal definition are not the same and one state's legal definition might be different from another's. So why not say this in the article. What definition a reader needs or wants depends on their purpose. For example, if a young person is reading a book meant for older persons and comes across the word adultery, his needs will be far different than those of a lawyer who's client walks in and says, """"They charged me with 'adultery'; what's that?"""" In the first case the reader might need nothing more than a dictionary definition (or perhaps a little more, particularly that it is rare for someone to go to jail for it), and in the second case, the lawyer will want to explain all the elements of the crime (each thing that must be proved by the government in order to find someone guilty, including that it was done knowingly, etc.).

 The beginning could say: """"Adultery, in some jurisdictions a crime or a tort (a civil wrong) is generally defined as (insert dictionary definition). However in the legal context of a person actually being charged with adultery as a crime or cited as a grounds for a divorce or other lawsuit, a more precise definition would be required.

 The term adultery usually refers to the rarely prosecuted common law or statutory crime relating to having extra-marital relations, but usually in an informal or literary context not in a legal context.

 In ordinary usage the vagueness of the term is not a hindrance to communication, as the scope of the term is understood to change from context to context, some requiring more specifics than others. In a legal sense, residents of the United States, for example, understand that such laws differ from state to state, and even from time to time as laws are changed, and thus any legal use of the term is understood to require new research practically any time it comes up.""""

 This is just a proposal off the top of my head and after reading what some of the other editors have said. Any coments? (BTW, I came to this article ecause I was looking at the list of disputed articles and I wondered why this one was on the list.)  """,0.0

This article had a large section that asserted that Gore lost the election to Bush because of Nader's votes. I removed the section. It was opinionated. It sounded like the usual rhetoric vomited up by the Democrats. Check it out. The Republicans stole that election through illegal means. Dubya was appointed by the Supreme Court. No matter how many or how few votes Nader got, Bush would have been in. This is all POV and has no place in a Wikipedia article. Here are just 2 out of many links that demonstrate this.

 Explanation 

Hi, I thought I'd explain why the pages keep getting deleted. The long and short is that we're really not quite sure what you are trying to do. The pages are given extremely unwieldy titles that are written like sentences, which makes them an unlikely search term. The pages also didn't assert how Razin was notable. 

I think that you were likely trying to write about Stepan Razin, as he was part of the Solovetsky Monastery Uprising. However I don't see anything on his page to show that he was an artist. You commented somewhere that there were paintings of his on eBay, which makes it unlikely that these two Razins are the same person. It's possible, but extremely unlikely. I think that the Razin that's a painter is probably a far more recent person since a search for """"S Razin"""" (the name that comes up in the eBay auctions) shows that he's from the 21st century, not from the 1600s.

omit Fox """"admission"""" of common currency intent

Someone did the same to the Independent Task Force on North America page which had this supposed """"admission"""" by Vincente Fox on Larry King the other night that plans were afoot to bring in a common NA currency.

This is covered on the talk page there, here is the transcript of the supposed """"admission.""""

KING: E-mail from Mrs. Gonzalez in Elizabeth, New Jersey. """"Mr. Fox, I would like to know how you feel about the possibility of having a Latin America united with one currency?""""

FOX: Long term, very long term. What we propose together, President Bush and myself, it's ALCA, which is a trade union for all of the Americas. And everything was running fluently until Hugo Chavez came. He decided to isolate himself. He decided to combat the idea and destroy the idea...

KING: It's going to be like the euro dollar, you mean?

FOX: Well, that would be long, long term. I think the processes to go, first step into is trading agreement. And then further on, a new vision, like we are trying to do with NAFTA.

It would seem that in discussing a possible process for a Latin American common currency, the phrase """"like we are trying to do with NAFTA"""" in discussing enhancing trade agreements is an """"admission"""" that currency union itself is on the table.

As to redirects, you are right. No rules prohibit creation of redirects from sensible titles. """"Sensible"""" is pretty much inclusive and a redirect from Ancient Rus is alredy created.

Please help me in doing some major clean ups on the pages to remove any unsourced information, speculation, and information directly copied from the CPTDB wiki page. For more proof, think back to the """"Viva Red"""" page that Hum1969 created about a Viva route on McCowan Road. His user page currently states that he wishes for a Viva route on McCowan, because """" MCCOWAN ROAD IN MARKHAM IS F***ING THE NUMBER ONE BUISIEST ROADS OF ALL TIME IN YORK REGION...""""

Just to be clear, in many cases I personally added a link pair like """"[[July 4]], [[1976 in radio|1976]]"""" to an article so 1) I created that link pair, 2) I did not realize that it broke autoformatting, and 3) I acknowledge that date autoformatting is now deprecated and is being removed by the bot.  Also to be clear, Lightbot is converting my example above to """"[[July 4]], [[1976]]"""" which 1) created a new yet deprecated autoformatted date link pair and 2) removes the useful, on topic link to 1976 in radio.  Given that there is no consensus for an urgent removal of date autoformatting, I'm simply asking that the bot not undo """"date in radio"""" links if it can't, as you note, handle them properly. -   """,0.0

Comment.  It's confusing enough that I am not sure what """"disagree"""" means in this conversation.  A quick run through my sources indicates that """"folk costume"""", """"folk dress"""", """"national dress"""", """"ethnic costume"""", """"traditonal dress"""" etc. are all used pretty much interchangeably.  I would support a move to """"folk costume"""" or """"folk dress"""" for the reasons cited above, but """"folk costume"""" should not be a subset of """"national dress"""" since modern political boundaries do not necessarily match either ethnic boundaries or political boundaries as they were at the time that folk dress was ossified (at least in Europe - as mentioned, some folk dress is still evolving).

[For what it's worth, I wouldn't characterize square dance clothes or bolo ties as folk dress - western wear is a modern retro concept based on romanticized notions of 19th century clothing, and bolo ties are a modern invention!  But bolo ties and cowboy shirts are certainly regional dress.]

By the way, the use of narrow use """"costume"""" to mean """"theatrical costume"""" is about as common as the use of """"dress"""" to mean """"a woman's garment with a skirt"""".  Both """"costume"""" and """"dress"""" have these narrow, non-specialist, everyday definitions which make it really difficult to decide what terms will be understood by users of Wikipedia.  """"Clothing"""" is probably the most neutral and inclusive term, but we struggle in choosing """"Medieval clothing"""" vs. """"Medieval costume"""" vs. """"Medieval dress"""".  And """"folk clothing"""" is not used in the specialist literature and sounds really dumb.  In the museum and art-historical worlds, """"costume"""" and """"dress"""" are both preferred terms.

OED definitions are pertinent here: 
COSTUME: The mode or fashion of personal attire and dress (including the way of wearing the hair, style of clothing and personal adornment) belonging to a particular nation, class, or period.
DRESS: Personal attire or apparel: orig. that proper to some special rank or order of person, or to some ceremony or function; but, in later use, often merely: Clothing, costume, garb, esp. that part which is external and serves for adornment as well as for covering.

 is right, in that there isn't a simple solution; we're going to have a ton of redirects and alterate terms whichever way we go.  Gievn the OED definitions, I'd say """"Folk costume"""" is more accurate.  But I personally prefer """"Folk dress"""", and I'd choose that over """"National dress"""". -   """,0.0

 Proposing renaming and new article draft 

Over the last couple of months I have produced a new draft of this article, working on behalf of New Leaders. The organization asked me to write an updated draft, better reflecting their new name and current programs and bringing the article into line with Wikipedia's guidelines. The most immediate issue with the current article is that the title is now incorrect. The organization has recently been renamed to """"New Leaders"""" and is now no longer """"New Leaders for New Schools"""". Due to this change, I believe that the article should be renamed.

I recognize that since I prepared my draft on behalf of New Leaders, I have a conflict of interest. So, before I make any changes, I'd like to ask that other editors read through my draft and my explanation here, and offer any feedback they might have. 

There are a number of problems with the current article, not least that it is rather promotional in tone. It seems that this has attracted the attention of editors in the past, as you can see from the warning tag. However, despite the warning tag, and the discussion that was opened by NDSteve10 on the Talk page (see above), there hasn't really been any improvement to the article in the last 12 months. No editors responded to the Talk page note, and only a few edits have been made. In fact, little has changed with the article since it was originally created in December 2009. 

The article currently has few citations, less than half of which are reliable secondary sources. The introduction doesn't adequately summarize the article, and certainly does not give a real sense of what New Leaders does. The most problematic sections are What it does and Educational impact, both of which are written in a promotional tone, especially the latter. In addition, the """"What it does"""" section is outdated, since the organization has since introduced new programs and initiatives. Meanwhile, the """"Educational impact"""" section provides a lot of detail, but would be better presented using Wikipedia's summary style. The information provided is cited to New Leaders' website, but makes no mention that the source of the claims is the organization itself.

I would like to propose a new draft of the article that addresses the issues with the current version, which you can view in my userspace:User:16912 Rhiannon/New Leaders

This is an entirely re-written article, using reliable secondary sources as much as possible, with new section headings to provide readers with a sense of the content at a glance, a new introduction which properly summarizes the article, and an infobox with all the key information about the organization fully up to date. The """"Creation and history"""" section now includes details of the organization's founding and expansion up to the present day. The descriptive information about New Leaders' has been removed, as this is more relevant in the new """"Function"""" section. The information from the current """"What it does"""" and """"Educational impact"""" sections has been rewritten under a new section heading of """"Function"""", which includes the organization's mission, its programs and its results. This section provides details of all the organization's current initiatives and an overview of the impact of these programs. I have retained the sections on """"Geographic reach"""" and """"Executive team"""", but updated the information in each and added citations. 

While I have put much effort into writing this from a neutral POV, I appreciate that due to my COI it may be that other editors have some changes to suggest. I welcome any productive feedback on the draft and my suggestion to rename the article to New Leaders. Please let me know if you have any thoughts or questions. Thanks,   """,0.0

 Request assistance deleting old talk page 

Greetings. two of the Wikipedia Sysops (or whatevery you call them here), refuse to let me delete the content of my talk page, for reasons that go beyond my understanding. Some of the material in the talk page is personal. The page includes rough drafts with mistakes that I never intended to make permanent. Had I known I would not be allowed to delete this material, I would never have posted it in the first place.

You recently archived part of the page, which is fine, of course. I told you at that time that I planned to clear the whole page, as I do from time to time. You raised no objection, and it never occured to me that anyone would object, but apparently these other two sysops do object. I would appreciate it if you could take steps to clear the page. If you want to keep a copy of any material there for your own purposes, please feel free to do so.

 From User talk:Jimbo Wales I wonder if you might consider...

I wonder if you might consider simply removing your political/religious/etc.  userboxes and asking others to do the same.  This seems to me to be the best way to quickly and easily end the userbox wars.

Userboxes of a political or, more broadly, polemical, nature are bad for the project.  They are attractive to the wrong kinds of people, and they give visitors the wrong idea of what it means to be a Wikipedian.

I think rather than us having to go through a mass deletion (which is what is likely to happen if the userbox fad doesn't go away), it will be better to simply change the culture, one person at a time.  Will you help me? 

 From WikiEN-l [...]

The current situation with these things being in the main Template namespace, and promoted as if healthy and normal in the Wikipedia namespace, is that they are damaging to our culture.  They are attracting the wrong sort of people, and giving newcomers the wrong idea of what it means to be a Wikipedian.

That's why they need to go.  Not to censor people's self-expression, but to make it clear that as a whole the community considers these things to be divisive and inappropriate. Jimmy Wales (jwales at wikia.com)

 The American Agenda to Homosexualize the World 

Why does this article make him sound like a bad person for condemning behaviors/traits that are obviously wrong and misplaced?? I was reading all his quotations and views in the article (which are in line with biblical teachings) and I realized that the conclusion given always made him look like a confused fellow.

 etymology 

The family consists of the genus Aplodactylus. The name means either """"single finger"""" or """"simple finger"""" (Greek haploos / aploe + daktylos). [Sourced to Fishbase, depending on whether you look at Aplodactylidae or Aplodactylus-punctatus]
Is anybody able to look at Cuvier and Valenciennes, 1832? This is supposed to be the original source of the genus name, and conceivably gives some insight as to where the name was meant to come from. (Primary sources aren't ideal, but a self-contradictory secondary source isn't better.) Presumably there is some defining and identifying property of the fish's fin, which not only gives it the name but would more broadly also be worth mentioning in the article.   """,0.0

 I followed the links to an article on """"consensus decision making"""". The entire article seemed to me to be on the simplistic side (perhaps due to my ongoing research in Organizational Communication), but it had a section on """"Quaker decision making."""" I don't know if it would be appropriate to link back here (sort of a 360 degree thing), but it certainly is relevant. 

 Perhaps an article on """"Quaker meetings"""" might be worth considering? I'm thinking in terms of examining several types of Quaker meetings (clearness, weddings, threshing, as well as business) in light of Quaker philosophies or traditional practices. Put another way, I am growing increasingly sensitive to cataloging """"weird Quaker ways of doing things"""" in a de-contextualized sense. Perhaps we would be better off discussing how the Quakers' beliefs led to these different ways of meeting? 

 Some suggestiongs: 
Universal ministry (everyone a minister), 
immediate access (not mediated by Priest or ecclesiastical structure), 
privileging peacemaking (refusing to accept any sort of social darwinism in which the strongor aggressively vocalprevail), and 
testimony of integrity (challenging participants to put beliefs into actions, even if it leads to unconventional methods)

 It doesn't have to be an apologetic for Quaker practices, but it would help explain why these practices are held so closely by Quakers, even of dramatically different theologies.

 And thank you all, for putting up with my """"bull in a china shop"""" entrance. My entries could have been read as patronizing and as assuming that I was the only """"real"""" Quaker present.

"""""""in the way of God"""" ==

i found some material of relevance in Reuven Firestone's work """"Jihad: The Origin of Holy War in Islam"""" (Oxford University Press) related to this current dispute. i wasn't actually looking for it, but came across it while looking for something else. anyway (p. 17):

The meaning of jihad
The semantic meaning of the Arabic term jihād has no relation to holy war or even war in general. It derives, rather from the root j.h.d., the meaning of which is to strive, exert oneself, or take extraordinary pains. Jihād is a verbal noun of the third Arabic form of the root jahada, which is defined classically as """"exerting one's utmost power, efforts, endeavors, or ability in contending with an object of disapprobation."""" 14 Such an object is often categorized in the literature as deriving from one of three sources: a visible enemy, the devil, and aspects of one's own self. There are, therefore, many kinds of jihād, and most have nothing to do with warfare. """"Jihād of the heart,"""" for example, denotes struggle against one's own sinful inclinations, while """"jihād of the tongue"""" requires speaking on behalf of the good and forbidding evil. 15 ...

(removed large quote from a narration about the varying kinds of jihad)

... Muhammad is also credited with saying: """"The best jihād is [speaking] a word of justice to a tyrannical ruler."""" 17 The qualifying phrase """"in the path of God"""" (fi sabīl Allah) specifically distinguishes the activity of jihād as furthering or promoting God's kingdom on earth. It can be done, for example, by simply striving to behave ethically and by speaking without causing harm to others or by actively defending Islam and propagating the faith. Jihād as religiously grounded warfare, sometimes referred to as """"jihād of the sword"""" (jihād al-sayf), is subsumed under the last two categories of defending Islam and propagating the faith, though these need not be accomplished only through war. When the term is used without qualifiers such as """"of the heart"""" or """"of the tongue,"""" however, it is universally understood as war on behalf of Islam (equivalent to """"jihād of the sword""""), and the merits of engaging in such jihād are described plentifully in the most-respected religious works. 18 Nevertheless, Muslim thinkers, and particularly ascetics and mystics, often differentiate between the """"greater jihād"""" (al-jihād al-akbar) and the """"lesser jihād"""" (al-jihād al-asghar), with the former representing the struggle against the self and only the """"lesser jihād"""" referring to warring in the path of God. 19 

 

Itaqallah, how was my suggested addition from Britannica Encyclopedia on the five types of jihad.  

I have no problem with """"in the way of God"""", since the sentence is phrased as giving jihad's meaning, not its literal meaning. -  

Another problem with the article is that it fails to mention the new interpretations of jihad (on the behalf of some renowned scholars) which disagree with usage of warfare except in defense.  
Too bad those guys weren't around during Muhammad's time.  
One can always fnd some quotes like the two above in a serious book on jihad. However, 99 percent of Firestone's work is about, yes, warfare.  Or

 NCCC and crossing the line 

I didn't read the entirety of this post yet, but I can tell you already that you crossed the line. So shortly after I cautioned that it was unwise to call names, you called LoverOfArt intellectually dishonest, incompetent, """"or both"""". This is plainly and unequivocally unacceptable.

You're going to have trouble maintaining credibility in this from here on out. Dbiel and I have both asked you to try and work with the group instead of blatantly against it. Dbiel explained why he thought we should start from a shortened article, and we've acknowledged all along that the criticisms section is a point of contention and needs to be addressed. And LoverOfArt, while he has been stand-offish, has not been nearly as contentious or offensive as you have.

You had a chance to work peacefully and neutrally with other editors, and you stubbornly rejected it in favor of pushing your point of view, at the expense of civility and your own credibility. I do not expect this to end well for you.

Crank_(person)...""""Crank"""" is a pejorative term for a person who 
holds some belief which the vast majority of his contemporaries would consider false, 
is eccentric, especially one who is unduly zealous,
is bad-tempered.
The term implies that 
a """"cranky"""" belief is so wildly at variance with some commonly accepted truth as to be ludicrous,
and arguing with the crank is useless, because he will invariably dismiss all evidence or arguments which contradict his cranky belief.

Common synonyms for """"crank"""" include kook and crackpot.  The word quack is usually reserved for someone who promotes a medical remedy or practice that they know to be ineffective. The crank differs from the fanatic in that the subject of the fanatic's obsession is not necessarily widely regarded as wrong, or a """"fringe"""" belief....   """,0.0

In a country like the U.S.A. with 48 state and hundreds of municipal and county capitals in addition to the federal capital in Washington all adequately guarded the problem is almost hopelessly complicated. At the worst an attempt at armed uprising would result in a series of unprecedented massacres, at best in an overtowering and very stupid bureaucracy or an equally stupid and far more cruel dictatorship of politicians."""" He distinguishes """"industrial unionism"""" from narrowly-defined """"anarcho-syndicalism"""" (does he mean Platformist conceptions of syndicalism, as with the CNT-FAI? I'm not sure). He also states """"And, unless they wish to give up the principle of 
democracy for the principle of dictatorship, they should refuse to give over the control of their organization to politicians or non-proletarian leaders of any stripe or color.""""

 Daniel, your encyclopedia is a joke, and the article about Sanchez is a great illustration of the many and sundry reasons it is a joke. Every single one of your """"pillars"""" and """"policies"""" has been violated in the article itself, the discussion thread, and the administration of it. You and your cabal have allowed the subject to edit his own article; you've blocked verified facts from the article; you've demonstrated a lack of neutrality and good faith throughout; you've abandoned any pretense of common sense or even-handedness.

 The result is an article that is just plain false. But, you see, this doesn't matter at Wikipedia, because at Wikipedia all truth is negotiable, when means it is politically determined. The good thing is that, aside from anything that happens at the Sanchez whitewash page, the world at large is onto you and your crew. Wikipedia's lack of respect for truth, and its wholly capricious and abitrary administration, not to mention the falsification of biographies by its insiders and the insertion of corporate propaganda into articles, has been discovered.

It's no secret that I'm not a native english speaker. I'm aware of my limits in handling english language. However I still can't see what would be so """"improper"""" in what I wrote, considering the formulation is exactly what native english speakers could read on a website made by a native english speaker.
Maybe the formulation wasn't clear enough (since someone else corrected it already), but I still don't see it as """"improper"""". This goes back to the difference between a neutral comment on my edits, and a bad-faith attack on my person. I hope you'll remember all this in our future exchanges (because no, I won't """"go away"""" and I predict many more clashes like that).

Concerning the following part of your message...These are things I already talked about weeks ago. Obviously you didn't bother reading what I wrote, and you still haven't read any of the Wikipedia documentation for contributors.
WP is a free and open encyclopedia, that anyone can edit at any time. None of its articles are ever finished, they can always be corrected, or deeply reworked. 
It's not my problem if unappropriate edits were made before I decided to modify the article. There has not been any consensus discussion that had approved your section, but anyway I'll note that even  consensus can change. As you can see, WP is based on flexibility.
And I think I have argued enough, I have explained enough why I considered your section had to be replaced. Honestly, I have not mentionned any personal problem against you or any other questionable motivation, I only remarked that rules had been ignored during the writing of that section, and thus it needed to go.
So, to finish with all that, it is not up to you to decide which article can be edited and which cannot be, or which contributor can edit which article. Because these articles do not belong to you. They belong to Wikipedia, and as I'm a part of Wikipedia, I'm also entitled to modify this article.
You've also the right not to agree with certain edits. In that case, to enforce your opinion, then you need to justify it and to explain what aspect of the rules could prevent a certain edit to be made. However, you do not have the right to prevent edits from being made just because you feel the article belongs to you and that you think your contributions are just perfect and don't need improvement.
You have no right to declare an article closed to further modifications just because you like it the way it is.

What really strikes me in your behavior, is that you actually don't give a damn about the content. Not once since you came to this talk page you bothered to argue about the actual content being discussed, nor tried to show if the rules would allow it. No, what mattered for you was only to find ways to assert your domination on articles. You're not fighting to justify or find qualities in the content, you're just fighting for a right to control articles, to maintain your version as the definite and perfect one, and to prevent people you don't like to touch articles.

This is completely anti-wikipedian. So read No ownership of articles and please stop disrupting WP. If I have to go through a dispute resolution process to make you stop, then I will do it next time you revert me again. 
And as I don't see any content discussion here, I consider this debate finished and I won't waste my time answering your claims of ownership.  """,0.0

Discuss every edit on a talk page. Do not react emotionally. Assume good faith (even when you are pretty sure that the other person is not acting that way). Never revert first. Don 't make or respond to personal attacks. If the other person is trying to make things heated try mediation. Following this lot can result in two outcomes: a. It ends up in arb comm and your case is unasible. b.your opponent adopts these tactics and you end up collaborating on the article.]

"I am really writing this post to counter the claims that Marxism has direct responsibility for human rights violations, or the regimes it has inspired, (although admittedly at the end of the day Marxism may hold some indirect reponsibility). I think the first person who posted may have a point, however to Telaviv one, although i agree with you that nearly every 'communist' regime has become a tyranny or mobocracy, you also have to realise that nearly every communist regime has not been at all orthodox Marxist. In orthodx marxism (which I dont support) Russia in 1917 would not have been fit to enter communism because it was mainly inhabited by a majority of agriculturalists, it was backwards, and most of its populace was uneducated or illeterate. China qualified even less, as it was totally backwards, and Mao basically disregarded orthodox Marxism, not to even mention cambodia or vietnam. I dont think was perfect, and I am no communist, but I think ideas can be learnt from every notweworthy philosophy, even Marx. You also have to realise Marx's motive for supporting communism was moral/ideological, whereas perhaps with the majority of revolutionary communists the reasons were nationalistic or materialistic, and therefore more associated with the right. What I am saying is that if Marx dictated that communist states should function as they have and do today, yes maybe human rights violations would deserve a mention, but his ideology is not to blame, it is the [people who follow his ideology who often commit the crimes.86.150.147.133   User: R.G.P.A",0.0

I have restated JHunterJ's version to use well-defined astronomical terms. JHunterJ's version was unclear because
 There is no official definition of """"zodiacal longitude"""".
 If we take """"zodiacal longitude"""" to mean celestial longitude, then every celestial object and constellation has a (range of) celestial longitude, so the statement becomes meaningless.
 As far as I can tell, modern astronomers no longer offer precise definitions of """"sign of the zodiac"""", and various media use the term in many different ways. Thus, the term is not well enough defined to decide of it is a mistake to describe Ophiuchus as the 13th sign of the zodiac.   """,0.0

Ernie Smith writes:     

Æµ§œš¹ There is an Afrocentiric view of the world and there is a non Afrocentric view.  As defined by Robert Williams the word Ebonics posits an Afrocentric view relative the origin and historical development of the language of descendants of enslaved Africans in America and throughout the diaspora.  The view that the language of descendants enslaved Africans in America and throughout the diaspora is a dialect of English or some other European language is a non Afrocentric view and it has nothing to do with Ebonics.  The counterfeiters and plagiarizers that have for years attempted to filch the word Ebonics and with the intent to deceive used the word Ebonics as a synonym for BE, AAVE and other such appellations clearly have Hoary confused. [See Smith (1997) and Smith and Crozier (1998)].   In the “About Wikipedia” section on the main page of  Wikipedia we are told the following as the etymological origin or genesis of the word “Wikipedia”:  “Wikipedia (pronounced /ˌwɪkɨˈpiːdi.ə/ WIK-i-PEE-dee-ə) is a multilingual, web-based, free-content encyclopedia project based on an openly-editable model. The name """"Wikipedia"""" is a portmanteau of the words wiki (a technology for creating collaborative websites, from the Hawaiian word wiki, meaning """"quick"""") and encyclopedia. Wikipedia's articles provide links to guide the user to related pages with additional information.”  Now, just as the word Ebonics is a is portmanteau of the words ‘ebony’ and ‘phonics’ the word or name Wikipedia is portmanteau of the words ‘wiki’ and ‘encyclopedia’.  According to the ‘About Wikikpedia’ section the word or name ‘Wikipedia’ is from the Hawaiian word ‘wiki’ meaning ‘quick’ not the word ‘wickyapi’ an Algonquian Indian language from which the word ‘wickiup’ is derived.  Thus the word Wikipedia is not derived from the Algonquian Indian word ‘wikiyapi’ and it origin has nothing to do with the word’wickiup’ that means “a hut used by nomadic Indians of the arid regions of the western and southwestern U.S.” (see Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary (2001:1347)  As defined by its author the word or name ‘Wikipedia’ is not a portmanteau of the word ‘wicked’ and ‘pedophile’ and it has noting to do with “wicked pedophiles”.  User Hoary thinks it is allright to encompass meanings for the word ‘Wikipedia’ that the founders of ‘Wikipdeia’ never intended and defend the use of any and all counterfeit meanings on the web all over the world. 
I accept what is presented in quotes above as being the origin and true meaning of the name “Wikipedia”.   I believe the meaning posited for Wikipedia above is the only authenthic meaning of word ‘Wikipedia’.   I wonder how the author(s) originator(s) of the name ‘Wikipedia’ would feel if there were counterfeiters and plagiarizers going all over the world misrepresenting and outright mis-using the name “Wikipedia”?

 Stillman inference 

a paragraph in the article, citing pp 14-16 of Stillman's 1979 work, reads as follows:

According to Stillman, Muhammad chose Sa'd ibn Mua'dh so as not to pronounce the judgment himself and avoid being accused of double standards given the precedents he had set with the Banu Qaynuqa and the Banu Nadir. Furthermore, Stillman infers from Abu Lubaba's gesture that Muhammad had decided the fate of the Qurayza even before their surrender.

however, the only relevant discussion i found was this (p.15):

When all hope was gone they [i.e. Qurayza] sought to surrender on the same terms as had the Naḍīr. This time the Prophet intended to make an example of them. He still could not act with complete disregard of public opinion. The degree of the Qurayẓa's treason was by no means clear. Muhammad had previously spared the Banū Qaynuqā c at the request of their former allies the Khazraj. Many Awsites were now pleading that their former confederates be shown mercy. Always the master politician, Muhammad stepped aside and appointed Sa`d b. Mu`ādh to pass judgment upon them. Sa`d was a devout Muslim and a chieftain of the Aws, who was dying of wounds received during the siege against the Qurayza. Sa`d took the hint and condemned the adult males to death and the hapless women and children to slavery. Muhammad then declared that this was none other than Allah's decision. Actually, it is clear from the Muslim sources that the Qurayza's fate had been decided even before their surrender. One of Muhammad's emissaries, Abū Lubāba, who had advised the Qurayẓa to give up, had to perform penance for hinting to the Jews what their real fate would be.

Stillman doesn't state or imply that Muhammad deferred judgement to Sa'd in order to avoid accusations of double standards (especially when he openly endorsed the decision), so i believe this is original research. what seems more apparent is that, because of the Awsites protesting, it was Sa'd (Aws chieftain) who was chosen to pronounce the judgement, as they may have been more accepting of the decree if it came from their tribal leader.again, with the second sentence in the article, i do not see how the solitary sentence discussing Abu Lubaba substantiates what has been written, or where Stillman is making any """"infer[ences]"""" that Banu Qurayza's fate had already been decided by Muhammad before their surrender.  
This is clear from the last two sentences of the excerpt. The first sentence states the conclusion; the second contains the premise.  Or 
could you also address the first point?  
This is clear from the following setences:This time the Prophet intended to make an example of them. He still could not act with complete disregard of public opinion. The degree of the Qurayẓa's treason was by no means clear. Muhammad had previously spared the Banū Qaynuqā at the request of their former allies the Khazraj. Many Awsites were now pleading that their former confederates be shown mercy. Always the master politician, Muhammad stepped aside and appointed Sa`d b. Mu`ādh to pass judgment upon them. Sa`d was a devout Muslim and a chieftain of the Aws, who was dying of wounds received during the siege against the Qurayza. Sa`d took the hint and condemned the adult males to death and the hapless women and children to slavery.
 Or 
i have provided that extract above, and commented on it: Stillman doesn't state or imply that Muhammad deferred judgement to Sa'd in order to avoid accusations of double standards (especially when he openly endorsed the decision), so i believe this is original research. what seems more apparent is that, because of the Awsites protesting",0.0

Well, thank you. We certainly agree on fundamental difficulty in communicating. I am able to hear what you have to say. I don't perceive you as a Great Evil in your idiom, or ill-intended (except perhaps on one point I'll go into later), and I can generally extend good faith when one is open to public discussion. Given the many confusions involved, I first need to know: 1. Are you now willing, as I am, to discuss the primary issues in detail in a consensus-building discussion subject to such WP:BRD principles as """"listen very carefully"""" and """"be ready to compromise""""?
If so, the first consensus I need is whether an article should exist on the topic of dramatically-concentrated short-period political fundraising. Your objections at AFD appear to me primarily as """"magnet for edit-warring"""" and """"WP:COATRACK"""" (you raise other concerns related to neologism, but they do not enter into the question as I've phrased it). These concerns both seem bad arguments per WP:RUBBISH because they are surmountable problems, and Wikipedians may not delete based on creator intent but on criteria like notability: we are expected to resolve edit wars and coatracks by DR, not deletion. 2. Given this, for what reasons if any would you oppose existence of an article on the topic of dramatically-concentrated short-period political fundraising? (If none, I would ask you to change your AFD entry at this point in good faith.)
The second consensus I need is how to disambiguate the search string """"moneybomb"""". Previously you advocated google bomb as the primary redirect. Independent of the previous paragraph, I would ask: 3. What is your specific justification that users entering the string """"moneybomb"""" would be interested primarily in a detailed description of search manipulation, with a mention of the fundraising form without further fundraising elaboration? (If none, please propose alternate disambiguation specifics.) This proposition, which your position amounts to, would imply there is greater connection of the string """"moneybomb"""" with search manipulation than with fundraising, which is an exceptional claim to me, requiring detailed explanation. I'm sure you recognize that both reliable sources on this point use the string """"money bombing"""" and significantly not """"moneybomb"""".

Tony Sidaway is a confirmed and vocal scientologist who often writes lengthy usenet posts describing his involvement with the church of scientology and extolling its virtues. Excellent and accomplished example of a bureaucratic fuck, Tony spends hours lurking on IRC under his favorite nick of Sherilyn Sideway to have cyber sex with unsuspecting guys.

On wikipedia there was a fake aspie and Tony Sidaway banned him.  Tony gives his reasons for banning: 
 """"I have blocked this editor becausae he's stupid"""" (spelling error preserved) 
 """"he's an obvious nutter ...  Let's just tell him to fuck off."""" 
 """"He's a troll. Our only appropriate words to him are """"fuck off.""""

If real gender means that much to him he shouldn't be doing """"virtual"""" sex in the first place. There are hundreds of real women walking around outside, looking for real sex."""" —Tony Sidaway 

Routinely, other bureaucratic fucks on wikipedia have blocked Tony. (log of blocks)

He also blocks others for reasons like """"Idiot"""", """"Particularly stupid troll"""" and an admin for """"Persistently flaunting a stupidly large signature with multiple image inclusions.""""

He also harasses banned users by reverting anything they write on their talk pages and protecting it simply by saying, """"they attempted to use their talk page.""""   Note: other wikipedia admins do this abuse, too.

He bans anyone who says the slightest thing even vaguely related to criticizing something even vaguely related to an admin.  He also hides what they say (example).

An aside, before I ask my question, I tried to provide dispute resolution in that incident, but my involvement was based upon my assumption that Drolz was concerned about being blocked, and wanted to assemble evidence should that occur.

I can understand why WP would want to discourage collections of misdeeds, but I can also understand why prohibiting it might equally be a problem. I haven't reached my own conclusions on what the policy should be.

Cu, I do not think it's so much a matter of translation as of using different recensions. All other things being equal we should use newer versions (though many contain commentaries so can be construed as secondary). But Bede seems to have been messed with over the years. Particularly, you'll find there appears to be a lacuna in all versions - Bede promises to return to """"the siege of Badon-hill, when they made no small slaughter of those enemies, about forty-four years after their arrival in England. But of this hereafter."""" And """"hereafter"""" never comes: what comes is the only loss of temporal sequence in the book. So this is why comprehensive secondary sources are needed. Anyhow, I am not going to try to impose some novel reading but on the other hand I accept that Martin of Tours was a soldier, Germanus led an army, Patrick's mission was accompanied by a Saxon fleet (Annals of Ulster) - I do not want to suppress this information in the service of an unrealistically sweetened picture of these Christian saints either. So this is why I am wary of the idea that those British bishops were dedicated to """"Romanism"""" - in fact the British invented all this """"Joseph of Arimathea"""" stuff purely in order to claim an apostolic succession that did NOT involve Rome.

Well, I am not calling it """"essay"""", because at first sight the text seemed quite encyclopedic to me, and the word """"rant"""" refers to form, not content. mikka (t) 

Agree with Mikka. I see that someone is making an attempt to salvage portions of the essay. I don't think that that's necessary, since just about all the points brought up in it are already better covered in more specialized articles, particularly collectivisation in the USSR.  

As I said above, I pared down the essay/rant in the """"Rise to Power"""" section (Mikka removed the same editor's """"essay"""" about Collectivization, quite rightly, as it's well covered in the relevant article). I also said that it's debatable if it needs to be there at all, even in the """"pared-down"""" version. I'm reluctant to remove someone's whole contribution, especially when they are a new editor, as I don't want to discourage new editors; but if the consensus feeling is that it should all go, then so be it. Incidentally, regarding """"form"""", when I looked at the mark-up behind the """"essay"""" it showed that the editor had separated it into paragraphs by indenting the separate paras, rather than leaving blank-lines, so it was just a case of a new-editor not being familiar with the correct way to format paragraphs, and ending up with one long para, hence looking like a """"rant"""". Also, new editors tend not to be familiar with the idea of keeping to the salient points and wiki-linking to in-depth articles. talk|contribs """,0.0

 Race and Intelligence: Asian-Americans 

I've noticed you've contributed much to the race/intelligence articles and thought these articles might interest you:

http://paa2009.princeton.edu/papers/90354

""""Using data from recent Current Population Surveys (CPS), this study compares third-and-higher 
generation with earlier generation Asian Americans and non-Hispanic whites in terms of 
socioeconomic characteristics and demographics. The findings suggest a “third-generation 
decline or flattening” for Asian American and white men as well as Asian American and white 
women. For each of these groups, the mean of years of schooling among the 2.5 and third 
generations is lower than among the first and second generations. This pattern is most 
pronounced among Asian Americans. As for wage determination, the generational differentials 
can be explained by educational attainment and other basic demographic variables. Overall, these 
results suggest that assimilation beyond the first generation immigrants no longer improves 
socioeconomic attainments as expected by traditional assimilation theory. Furthermore, in the 
case of Asian Americans, cultural assimilation across the generations may actually lower 
educational attainment and thereby reduce wages contrary to traditional assimilation theory.""""

""""It is widely noted that Asian immigrant parents have higher educational and socioeconomic 
expectations and motivations for their children than do non-Hispanic white parents (e.g., Goyette 
and Xie 1999; Kao 1995, 2004). Asian families also tend to invest more aggressively in 
financial, human, and within-family social capital than families from other racial groups (e.g., 
Sun 1998). Yet, protective effects of ethnic cultures and resources decline according to more 
acculturation into the mainstream U.S. society (e.g., Kao and Tienda 1995). As third-or-higher 
generation Asians become more “Americanized,” they tend to embrace the prevailing U.S. norm 
that as long as good efforts have been made based on one’s ability, the outcome would be 
acceptable even though one has not achieved the best performance or reached a higher level of 
education (Chen and Stevenson 1989; Stevenson 1988).""""

Likewise...

http://www.ibtimes.com/asian-americans-increasingly-defying-stem-stereotype-246578

""""Shinagawa pointed out another interesting phenomenon; later generation (second, third, fourth, etc.) Asian Americans on average have markedly lower education and income compared to immigrant Asians.

In 2007, 33 percent of PhDs conferred in the U.S. were to Asians. However, of that 33 percent, only 2 percent were Asians Americans born or raised in the U.S.""""

These trends are reflected in their TIMSS/PIRLS scores, which are often used by people like Charles Murray and Richard Lynn as proxies for IQ.

http://i39.tinypic.com/zob4p0.png

Note that native born Asian-Americans perform worse than native born Whites in every subject.

My goal here is not to put down Asian-Americans, but I've noticed that lots of modern racialists like to use Asians as a battering ram against other minorities. Yet, as the above evidence indicates, even """"model minorities"""" who start from a much more advantageous position than the others can still succumb to negative cultural influences which significantly hurt their academic performance. This suggests that culture does, indeed, matter greatly, even on exams like the TIMSS which supposedly test for 'g'. 

If you have any contacts with academics in the field, perhaps you'd like to pass this information along? James Flynn who wrote an entire book on Asian-Americans might be particularly interested.""",0.0

"""
 WikiMarkup 

Wikipedia has it's own special """"language"""" called """"WikiMarkup"""". It is very important, therefore, to know a good deal of it when you begin to write an article.

 Links 
 External links 
An external link is a link that goes to another website, besides Wikipedia. They are formatted like this: [Name of website goes here].
For example: [http://www.google.com] becomes . 
To display alternate text for an external link, type [Name of website goes here Alternate text goes here]. Note the space between the website's name and the alternate text.
For example: [http://www.google.com Google search engine] becomes Google search engine.

 Internal links 
An internal link is a link that links to any page within Wikipedia. They are formatted like this:[[Name of page goes here]]
For example: [[Giraffe]] becomes Giraffe.
An internal link can display alternate text through the use of a pipe character """"|""""
For example: [[Giraffe|A long-necked animal that lives on the plains of Africa]]. becomes A long-necked animal that lives on the plains of Africa.
Normal text can also be blended into a link.
For example: I like [[Giraffe]]s. becomes I like Giraffes.
Internal links can link across namespaces.
For example: [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view]] becomes Wikipedia:Neutral point of view.
They can also use Pipe tricks.
For example: [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|]] (note the pipe character before the two end brackets) becomes Neutral point of view
For example: [[Orange (fruit)|]] becomes Orange.

 Redirects 

A redirect is a page that, if accessed, sends you to a related page automagically. For an example of this, see Gill net. Note how at the top of the page it says (Redirected from Gill net). Voila!
For example: #REDIRECT [[United States]] redirects whatever page it was on to United States.

 Proposition 

This article is overwhelmed with images of socialist emblems. This is not a gallery, this is an article about socialist heraldry, and it is no rally useful to have images of every single socialist emblem ever used. I think we should make an inclusion criteria for images of emblems in this article. I propose this inclusion criteria: 
We should only add to this article images of emblems of internationally recognized states that existed for more than few years. If the state used several similar emblems during it's existence, they should not all be added, but only the one that was used the longest.
According to this proposition, we don't need emblems of unrecognized states like Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic and Luhansk People's Republic. We also do not need three emblems of Socialist Bulgaria () because they are very similar, practically the same. I am going to remove some emblems according to this proposition.

 Worst Season ever 
Anyone who likes Seasons 4 and onward have obviously NOT seen any of the old episodes from 1999-2004 and therefore is a total dickbag. I can never tell you how much I HATE the new SpongeBob!!! Nick had stopped caring about good animation and started caring only about the cash the SECOND they started this show. The old ones are great, while the new ones, I'd give an F plus 500 million minuses! I'd be so damn shocked if anybody even likes these new episodes, because anyone who does is downright retarded. It's like all Nick's staff wants to do now is win themselves a bunch of hot girls!

When the stooges at Nick began this show, it was nothing but great humor for 5 years. Now, SpongeBob's crew had lost ANY sight of what """"good quality"""" is all about! The writing is totally fucked up! I mean, Seriously, """"For Here or To Go""""? Who the fucking hell would watch an episode about taking orders at a fast food restaurant deciding whether or not to eat it at the restauraunt or home? I know there are now just copying off ideas of old episodes. Ex: Petsitter Pat. Patrick says the bath is gonna come to Gary. That's EXACTLY what SpongeBob said to Gary in """"Gary Takes a Bath"""", but that version is WAAAAAAY better than this new junk that anybody likes is mentally challenged and obviously hasn't watched the first three seasons! Even true SpongeBob fans should only like Season 1-3, because no episodes past that were even remotely decent. And I know for a fact it will never be as good as it used to be. I'm 100% certain that is true. ANYBODY who likes anything of the Post Movie era is just either brain-dead or childish. Stephen Hillenburg really knew quality, but now we just have a bunch of screwed-up polesmokers who only want the money. And NOTHING else! They're just like fucking Mr. Krabs clones! Paul Tibbit must be drunk or something, and Tom Kenny must have swallowed a slide whistle, because now SpongeBob is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING EXCEPT FOR UTTER GARBAGE THAT IS ALL BUT INTOLERABLE!!! Like I said, I cannot believe there are people that actually LIKE these new episodes! Everybody that likes Seasons 4-8 smoke too much crack! Anybody who's into the new SpongeBob doesn't know shit about quality if it hit him square in the ballsack! All I can say is, I am SO RELIEVED this show is ending in 2014. Only 2 more years of this trash that I will have to sit through! If they make a SpongeBob Channel, they should only do reruns of the first three seasons, because absolutely nothing afterwards was good. So there goes 7 years of my life I know I will never get back. I am not going to wait too much longer for them to cancel this unfunny garbage, because it needs to happen soon.71.74.87.105

First problem ParacusForward like most wiki editors you don't understand the subject but wiki functions like a micropedia if they want more information the real people's encyclopaediais called Google. Either you don't understand the problems of getting past the big brother police state of Manipur where people are terrified to report the truth or you don't care. I thought perhaps this might be a place to release info but I noticed the spike in info came from reports available via google. One national tv company followed by a local newspaper broke the story on the death threats and hate mail. Then the gangsters responded in an Indian national tabloid. Now they are trying to put the djinn back into the bottle. I don't think you are necessarily malicious the police and security forces wouldn't have to pay you to supress the truth. You are clearly racist or if you prefer the more encylopaediac term ethnocentric. One of the sources the only one I saw that was completely incorrect is a Chinese Government Human Rights Agency. They are not so hot on Tibet and can be truthful on non chinese human rights abuses but in Manipur they have close links with the major human rights NGO which has long been run by the local police. I am sure things will happen but since you haven't got any interest in updating it none will report it here. I don't believe it is helpful either. Wiki did not allow the 24 hours grace to support to keep my fiancee alive again not out of malice but because of aspergers syndrome. I am sending her Hard Times if you haven't read it Wiki does a good summary they are also good for things like definition of satyagraha but for up to date info Google is the first port of call or Twitter. So anyway good luck with your project but the manner in which a few ignorant racist wiki editors claim ownership of this venture with nobody else having the courage to challenge them in case they too are red handed by a confederacy of dunces will make it less relevant. It is far from accurate or up to date. Mainly because editors like you do not have sufficient background understanding of hte politics and culture of the articles you edit. Before I began editing wiki hadn't updated info for several years. No doubt now you will accept unchallenged the false government reports which because they carry the weight of Chinese Propaganda agencies and local newspapers wholly intimidated by the Manipur State and corrupt police will now stand unchallenged by the editors who look only at code grammar and syntax and have no understanding of hte problems of truth reporting from within a police state of the third world.

 Colbert's character 

Saying his character is mocking right-wing pundits is fine, but there is no source to say he is specifically imitating Hannity or O'Reilly.  True, a couple sources do point out similarities, but what exactly makes these (highly opinionated) sources authorities on the specific people who Colbert is supposedly imitating?  Colbert mentions that Hannity and O'Reilly are """"over-the-top"""" as far as personality driven opinions go, but he doesn't say that's who he's imitating.  Besides, he doesn't even say them exclusively, he says """"someone LIKE Hannity or O'Reilly"""".

His own words don't suffice here, and a source pointing out similarities and asserting in a totally non-objective (try putting """"Bill O'Reilly's bullying media-age demagoguery"""" into the article and see what you get) way is not enough to include the comparison.   (Karwynn) """,0.0

 Crocus olivieri istanbulensis 

Dear Rivertorch,

This taxon is one on the three subspecies of Crocus olivieri.
Its correct name is Crocus olivieri Gray subsp. istanbulensis B. Mathew. I have corrected it. 

I hope the anonymous user will not change it again.

Best regards,  (To reply) 

Hi Réginald. If you hadn't arrived on the scene, I was going to ping you. I removed the Turkish image and link, since I didn't think they were germane, but I left it to you to fix the taxonomic details. Does Mathew's classification, as it appears in the article, contain all the known species of crocus?   

Hi River,
The page contains all the recorded species, but not the infraspecific taxa (i.e., the numerous subspecies). Originally Crocus olivieri subsp. istanbulensis was for this reason not included. For consistency reason including it required to mention also -as I did- the two other subspecies olivieri and balansae.
The issue is: if we want to be fully consistent we have to mention also all recorded subspecies (with their distribution as for that of C. olivieri?), among others the numerous subspecies of the variable C. biflorus. A niggling work! I am afraid that the page will become too scholastic.
Your advice about this issue?
Best regards,  (To reply) 
PS: You can find a quite complete list of species and their subspecies on the NCBI taxonomy browser. Type """"Crocus"""" in the """"search for"""" bar.  (To reply) 

Thanks for the link—that's a great resource. I don't think we should worry about its being too scholastic. My main concern would be with consistency: I'm not sure if there are comparable articles that also list all subspecies. The information about subspecies certainly should be available on Wikipedia, but should it go in the main article or in the more specific articles about each species (of which there are now only a few). I don't know.   
For consistency reasons I have added the other subspecies reported in the NCBI taxonomy and cited the source. I agree that additional paragraphs or articles should be written for the most representative species, in which a detailed description of their subspecies would then be done (as e.g. I have done in fr:Crocus).  (To reply) 
Okay. I'd be happy to help with creating new articles and refining translations, if you want to go that route. Just remember I don't know what I'm talking about ;-)    

Dear River,
I have removed again the the logo of the Sultanbeyli District Municipality, that User:Terzinator had added again to Crocus, explaining the reason for doing it (see User talk:Terzinator). Hopefully, he/she will not add it again!
Best regards,  (To reply) 
Thanks, Réginald. I don't do edit wars, so I'm glad there's someone else diligently watching the page. I see that the image appears to lack any copyright info or fair-use claims. I try to avoid any involvement with enforcement of image policies, but if it gets added again I will see if it can be deleted on those grounds.

One thing we like to tell newcomers is to be bold! By this we mean don't be afraid to join the rest of us in improving the articles you see here. Most Wikipedians are friendly and patient, willing to give you the same respect you give them, no matter who they are or how long they've been here. Still, some newcomers find that it's also good to be cautious. You may want to start out small and learn the ropes by fixing typos or just browsing. If so, that's okay, too. If you spot an error on a page, go ahead and fix it! If it's a big edit or a controversial issue, you may want to look at the article's talk page to see if the issue has been discussed in the past. It's important to cite references and set personal points of view aside.

Additional tips 
Here are some extra tips to help you get around in Wikipedia: 
If you want to play around with your new Wiki skills the Sandbox is for you.TAB
You can sign your name using three tildes (~). If you use four, you can add a datestamp too. 
You may want to add yourself to the new user log.TAB 
If you ever think a page or image should be deleted, please list it at the votes for deletion page. There is also a votes for undeletion page if you want to retrieve something that you think should not have been deleted.
If you're still entirely confused, or would like to get a better grasp of your wikipedia skills, and you have an IRC client (or don't mind getting one), check out the Bootcamp. It's not what it sounds like, but it is fun and can help you with your editing skills.

"""

 My signature and your actions ~  

I thought about taking this to a dispute hearing, but I couldn't be fucked.  So, I'm just going to outline here why I think that your blocking of my account was unjustified and against policy.  

You stated when you blocked me, """"anon. only, account creation blocked) with an expiry time of indefinite (personal attack in signature - will unblock on signature change"""" .  I disagree with your action on three levels.  The first is that it was a personal attack, the second on the indefinite ban, and the third on any action at all.  

 Why it wasn't a personal attack 
""""The primary purpose of creating any block is to protect Wikipedia and its editors and users from harm."""" (From WP:BP).  Of the list of reasons, on WP:BP the only one plausibly applicable is """"Disruption"""".  Under this it has 

""""A user may be blocked when his/her conduct severely disrupts the project — his/her conduct is inconsistent with a civil, collegial atmosphere and interferes with the process of editors working together harmoniously to create an encyclopedia.""""

And """"Blocks for general incivility are controversial"""".
In no way could any of my actions be considered """"severely"""" disruptive.  Or even simply disruptive.  While it could be argued that my signature was generally uncivil (and I disagree, more later), blocking for this reason is controversial and should have been discussed first.  So, from WP:BP there is no reason (in my opinion) to block.  

Now we examine WP:NPA.  This is simply, """"Do not make personal attacks anywhere in Wikipedia"""" and I agree with it.  The point here is """"personal"""".  My signature was not a personal attack on anyone.  It was a generalised comment and an """"in joke"""" (I can't help it if you are not in on the joke).  For the """"attack"""" to be personal, you would need to find someone who was """"attacked"""", you would not be able to do this.  

So, my signature did not constitute an attack on anyone, it did not disrupt discussion or affect the quality of my edits, thus it should not be a factor in anything.  

As to general incivility, I simply disagree.  From WP:CIVIL, """"Whereas incivility is roughly defined as personally targeted behavior that causes an atmosphere of greater conflict and stress"""".  My signature was not """"personally targeted behavior"""" (as explained above), and I also fail to see how it could cause an atmosphere of """"conflict"""" or """"stress"""".  There is nothing in this policy which is applicable in this case.

 Why I should not have been blocked 
In blocking me indefinitely, you violated WP:BP which states, 

""""Established users with significant constructive edits should not be indefinitely blocked except when there is a community ban. In all other cases, they should be handled with appropriate time-limited blocks or arbitration. Indefinite blocks should not usually be placed on IP users (whether individual IPs or IP ranges) in order to avoid inadvertently blocking legitimate users.""""

In blocking me at all, I also feel that you violated WP:BP.  You did not have a clear reason to block me, and you did so indefinitely.  In these cases, you should have posted at WP:ANI asking for advice and/or detailing why you felt that the block was needed.

 What could have happened 
So, what could you have done?  Well, the simplest thing would have to post on my talk page a comment asking me to change my signature and pointing to the policy which it violated (see the previous case for an example).  If you had have done this (and I had agreed with your argument) then I would have simply changed my signature.  If I had failed to change my signature, then you could have discussed it with me more, and/or taken it to a hearing.   

 Conclusion 
As I said at the beginning, I didn't want to take this to a hearing.  However, I feel that I would be perfectly within my rights to do so, and I reserve the right to do so.  This, by the way, is simply a statement.  

What would I like you to do?  Well, an apology would be nice, perhaps something worded along the lines of """"I'm sorry for not talking to you first, not checking policy and for violating policy by indefinitely blocking you"""".  

If you are unable to give an apology (for whatever reason, say you believe that you were in the right and still are), then I would appreciate a comment regardless.  

A comment on my userpage would be noticed faster, but here would be fine as well.

Dear Q, I know all this. My main concern was to change the dead wikilink into one that linked to Albert. I know that his title was King of the Romans but I think it is common WP pratice to use the term """"King of Germany"""" for that respective office to avoid confusion. Also, to say that there was no Germany at that time is wrong - there was a German Kingdom that was part (in fact the primary part of the Holy Roman Empire. And Albert was King of that Kingdom. I hope you understand.  (smile back) 

I rather disagree with you, but in a friendly way (I hate edit-war nonsense). I think it's possible to create links without necessarily making page titles—and there really are some atrocious ones about ('Ladislas the Posthumous' being one of them, in my opinion)—appear on the page in question. 

It is certainly possible and reasonable to call Albert """"King of the Germans"""" or """"German King"""" (the Germans themselves use the term """"Römisch-deutscher König"""", which covers it nicely. But even here on English Wikipedia, where there are many mistakes in this matter, the term """"King of Germany"""" is rarely used. Of course there was a Germany at that time in the sense of a German-speaking volk,  but there was not a German kingdom in the sense of a political state ruled by a royal government (when a later King of the Romans, Ferdinand I, tried to administer Hungary and Bohemia from Vienna, he was rebuffed— and he wouldn't have even tried that much in principalities where he was not the dynastic prince, such as Saxony or Brandenburg); the nearest thing to a German kindom, the Carolingian kingdom of the East Franks (even that has been called the Kingdom of Germany only as a back-formation), had fragmented fairly quickly into a group of states with their own princes (in the case of Bohemia, an actual king). Albert II is an interesting case because in his purely German-speaking territories he was only a duke. His kingdoms of Bohemia and Hungary, though part of the Holy Roman Empire, were largely non-German, which is another reason why Rex Romanorum is correct and not """"King of Germany"""".

The English Wikipedia article on the subject is very inaccurate, announcing the academically unjustifiable decision to use the term """"Kingdom of Germany"""" for clarification's sake. In my opinion, having had this stuff drummed into me at university, where I had to read texts in Latin and German, that doesn't so much clarify as blur the issue. The title """"King of the Romans"""" may be difficult, and so may the idea of a group of independent German (and non-German) states within the Holy Roman Empire, but the readers of Wikipedia, in my opinion, shouldn't have history revised for them to make it fit the modern world (and Austria still isn't the same country as Germany anyway). Fortunately, the  articles on this subject on German Wikipedia use the correct terminology. """,0.0

Ali, please, provide us with neutral third-party reports, citing """"Iranian Azerbaijanis for the most part consider themselves Iranian"""".

@Hans Adler, truth and/or verifiability

Let's talk about truth and/or verifiability. You had corrected the name """"Stadtzeitung"""" we have in note #4 of this article into """"Stattzeitung"""", because only the latter was verifiable, you said. Then, by chance, somebody found out the link to the """"Stadtzeitung für Freiburg"""" and the erroneous correction could be reverted. Notice that if there had been no documentation of the """"Stadtzeitung für Freiburg"""" online, but only, say, in a press archive in Freiburg, or if nobody had made the effort to verify the verifiability, the error would not have been detected, and the """"truth"""" would now be, erroneously, """"Stattzeitung"""". A beautiful mistake, by the way, very evangelical, being of the same sort as those we can find in the manuscripts of the Gospel.   ;-)

But let us apply this to another case, take Anton van Hooff, who is in charge to turn King's evidence for """"pseudo-science"""", """"severe methodological flaws"""" and """"factual errors"""". Of course, he has written this, among several name-callings, so this is verifiable. But can we take it seriously? If we look closer we see that the first accusation of van Hooff towards Carotta was to not have taken into account the well known Tacitus-passage about Nero and the """"christians"""". But since Carotta had treated it in detail, van Hooff was exposed, because he had shown that he had attacked a book without having read it, so that he himself was convicted of the """"severe methodological flaws"""" and """"factual errors"""" he tried to impute to other people. The subsequent escalation with the accusation of """"pseudo-science"""" was only his embarrassing attempt to divert from the lack of professionality he had shown. This, too, can be verified. The question is then: Which verification is relevant?

Van Hooff is refered to as a """"Senior lecturer of Ancient History and Teacher Trainer for Classics at Nijmegen University, the Netherlands"""" in the link given in note #17. But we see that at the University of Sofia he is also called """"Professor Associate"""". Looking on the Internet we can verify that he is called a """"professor"""" on several websites. Looking closer we can also verify that he was never a professor, and is by now a teacher in a secondary school, as he himself stated in a newspaper article. So what have we truly verified? That he is a confidence trickster who let himself be called a professor without actually being one, in order to improve his authority as an alleged important scholar? If we look to the list of publications he is giving there, we see that he is speaking of """"numerous books and articles"""" but specifies only one title. Modesty or showing-off?

Van Hooff being a notorious polemicist, can his accusations be taken seriously? Nobody does it in The Netherlands (why is there no article about him in the Dutch WP? – The only Antoon van Hooff listed there is a zoo director, who was ashamed of the homonymy), but he is taken seriously here, in the English WP where most """"judges"""" do not even understand Dutch. Why? Because it is so stated in the German WP already? If we take a look at the history there, we can verify that somebody had first put the article in the category """"Pseudowissenschaft"""" (pseudo-science), but then, this being not allowed because libelous, they """"discovered"""" """"Van Hooff"""", taking him as """"proof"""", without examining his credibility, happy to have the possibility to maintain their libelous allegation in an appearance of legality: it is """"only"""" a quotation! ;-)

What a complete crock.  By calling everyone under the age of 18 a """"child"""", which the dictionary correctly defines as a human between the ages of infancy and puberty, you can make everything even remotely sexual sound salacious and evil.  Teenagers are insulted to be called """"children,"""" and if you start using terms like """"teenage sex"""" and """"teenage sex with adults"""" to describe problematical behavior by kids old enough to know better, the """"poor little abused children"""" angle is more difficult to sell.  Maybe we should just go to the ultimate extreme, and legally define everyone under 18 as a """"baby.""""  Then all sex with minors could be """"poor little babies being abused and raped,"""" which would no doubt please the Judith Reisman's, John Ashcroft's, and David Finkelhor's of the world.  When such semantic games have to be employed to sell an agenda, with disqualification of everyone holding a different perspective as """"perpetuating the abuse"""", what you have is pseudo-science and flim-flam, and not unbiased reporting. 20:10""",0.14285714285714285

 Devante Cole 

Hi I noticed you reverted my removal of the manchester city first team navbox from the Devante Cole article. The reason I removed it is he is not a member of the first team and not listed in the navbox so the navbox should not be on his page. I also removed it from several other players pages and included a transclusion check link and source on the template page. Do you think I'm wrong? I was just doing some article maintenance. Thanks  Bradbury

 FC Spartaki Tskhinvali 

From what I can see, FC Spartaki Tskhinvali has been renamed to only 'FC Tskhinvali' (in January 2015 according to the article). They have a new logo in the article and are known as 'FC Tskhinvali' at Soccerway while UEFA has them only as 'Tskhinvali' (for some reason they dont use FC for only that team?). Their own webpage http://www.fcspartak.ge/ seems to support 'FC Tskhinvali'. I can not move the page, admin is needed. Do you think we should move it and if so, can you do it?  (talk)

"""

 rework begun 

I suggest to rework the """"Initial theories"""" section along these line:

First
First I suggest to delete the Technical failure section and move the relevant information (that the plane was fine) to the Investigation section under a new title and with the following text:

 The Plane 

The aircraft, a Tupolev Tu-154M, construction number 90A837, was manufactured at Kuibyshev aviation plant (No. 18) on 29 June 1990 for the Polish Air Force.
It was one of two Tupolev Tu-154s that served as official government jets; this aircraft—with a tail number of 101—was for presidential use, while another—marked 102—is used by the prime minister. The aircraft had undergone a major overhaul in December 2009 and Aleksey Gusev, the head of the maintenance plant that carried out the work, told Polish TV that it should not have had technical problems. The airplane had received a 5-year/7500-flight-hour warranty after the overhaul yet the crash happened after just 138 flight hours.

Second
As second part of the rework I suggest to edit half of the VIP passenger syndrome section away and put the remaining paragraph last in the section Investigation:

There has been some speculation in the press, that the planes pilot was under pressure to land in Smolensk in spite of the averse weather conditions. These speculations were linked to an earlier event in August 2008, when another pilot of the 36th Special Aviation Regiment was pressured by president Kaczyński to land in Tbilisi during the South Ossetian war between Georgia and Russia. During that incident, Pietruczuk was asked by the president's staff to change the flight plan and land in Tbilisi. After consulting with the commander of his unit, Pietruczuk refused, justifying his decision by safety concerns. He was then visited in the cockpit by Kaczyński himself, who tried to convince him to change his mind. Kaczyński later told journalists: """"If someone decides to become an officer, they should not be cowardly"""". Nevertheless, Pietruczuk held his ground and the plane landed in Azerbaijan as planned. A few weeks after this incident Pietruczuk was decorated by the defense minister for following correct procedures in this case and keeping the safety of his passengers utmost in his mind. Pietruczuk continued to fly the president's plane after the incident, even after Kaczyński expressed unhappiness with his performance during the flight to Tbilisi.

Third
Thridly I would shorten the Instrument landing system incompatibility section, rename it and definitely delete the """"may be using"""" part and put the resulting section directly under the the section """"The",0.0
"""

The mention in the footnote does not serve to balance the text in the main body to the effect that """"Gilens and Page do not characterize the US as an """"oligarchy"""" per se.""""
Furthermore, the concept of """"civil-oligarchy"""" is easily important enough to require introduction in the main body. Thus, using the block quote with the prefacing sentence as I have done serves to both introduce the concept and accurately represent the gist of Gilens and Page.

"Thanks to all for taking my rather offhand comment seriously.  To reiterate my original explanatoin to James: I'm interested in this more on a meta level (how do we approach controversial subjects) than out of deep feelings one way or the other towards Moore and his film; that is, I'm trying to see the forest of making a good article on the film rather than the trees of every factual detail within the film that contributors might have multiple viewpoints about.  For an encyclopedia based around the concept of a Neutral Point of View, any attempt to either counter or defend the content of a subject that is, in itself, an editorial statment seems wrong; such discussions wind up as parasites draining the life and meaning out of an otherwise useful article.

Even if you really consider Moore's movie to be completely indefinsible propaganda (and to risk the Wiki-equivalent of Godwin's Law here), note that the article on Triumph of the Will doesn't feel the need to explain all the reasons why Nazi Germany wasn't all it was cracked up to be.   Similarly, shouldn't we just describe the content of the movie (noting that it is controversial), and then if we want an article about the Bin Laden family departure or whatever we can put the facts about that subject there?   20:19, 5 Jul 2004 (UTC)",0.0

 Scarborough Nicknames 

While I don't really want to expand on this section, there are in fact some web references to Scompton:

You know you're from Scarborugh when...
Busta Rules

There is also a wikipedia page called Canadian slang which references Scompton as well as a couple of other nicknames not mentioned in the Scarborough article. I used Clusty search engine to find these references. Up to you whether you want to put this reference back. I don't care one way or the other.

Regards,  

You're absolutely correct.  Serves me right for editing before my first cup of coffee in the morning.  I found nothing relevant for Scompton, but when I redid the search later, I did get results thru a search for Scompton AND Scarborough. I ought not to have deleted the entry based on a Google search turning up nothing.Personally, I generally don't see any value in having a section for nicknames for the municipality.  But there is obviously precedent for having it (e.g. Toronto).  The problem I have with these sections is that they end up including obvious entries (like """"Hogtown"""" for Toronto), but then also up end up including nicknames that may be used in some circles but don't have particularly wide usage.  The particular problem here in the Scarborough article is that so many of the nicknames have such a negative connotation  perhaps that's just a reflection of public perception, but I do believe that it does, to a degree, give the reader the wrong impression of the place.  Frankly, I am just waiting for someone to add """"Scandahar"""" to the list. I'm not from Scarborough, so I will leave the list in the hands of folks who have a better sense of whether its inclusion is justified.  Given your edits to the article, you are probably better placed to make that call than I. Cheers,  """,0.0
"2012 Facts 

Maybe, just maybe I can make this clear enough for you all. 12.21.2012 is a date derived from a calendar system, that is based on astronomy. Granted, almost no one understands the astronomy involved, but that does not deny the fact. There are ASTRONOMICAL events that are FACTS, that WILL occur in 2012. What these mean, is the realm of astrology and that is what we are dealing with; an astrological phenomena. Rather than focusing on all that humanity doesn't understand, and so contributing to the fear, maybe Wiki can refocus on what WILL happen in 2012, factually, and let people give meaning to it themselves. As of now, Wiki is helping create the 2012 doomsday phenomena and is misleading and scaring lots and lots and lots of people. Competing with Sony Pictures? MARDYKS 63.232.20.2",0.0

ikipedia Founder Hit With Relationship Trouble, Allegations of Excessive Spending
By Megan McCarthy March 03, 2008 | 3:34:58 PMCategories: People  
Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales didn't have such a good weekend. First the blogosphere and then Wikipedia itself lit up with news of his messy breakup with controversial Canadian TV pundit Rachel Marsden. Now, accusations are flying that Wales has been living the high life on the expense account of the nonprofit foundation he created.
On Friday, reports surfaced that the married-but-divorcing Internet icon carried on a clandestine affair with Marsden.  Evidence of the affair included lurid IM transcripts, which appeared on Silicon Valley gossip blog Valleywag. On Saturday, Wales posted a statement on the Wikipedia Foundations website (which he later moved to his personal site) denying that his actions went against Wikimedia Foundation's policies, and stating that the affair had ended. Marsden responded by listing the clothes that he left at her house up for auction on eBay.
So, what's the big deal when a relationship goes sour? Well, the two met when Marsden contacted Wales to help her """"clean up"""" what she perceived to be errors on her personal Wikipedia page, and there have been allegations that Wales used his influence to improperly make changes.
Former associates of Wales' are using this scandal to bring up other worries they have about the organization of the foundation. Former Wikimedia exec Danny Wool, who left the foundation last year, wrote a blog post insinuating that Wales used the non-profit foundation as his own personal piggy bank. Expenses that Wales tried to apply to the foundation included $300+ bottles of wine and visits to Moscow massage parlors, Wool alleges. According to Wool, the expenses got so out of hand that the Wikimedia foundation took away Wales' corporate credit card.
""""There were occasions where he used [the Wikimedia Foundation] for personal advancement under the guide of the mission.  And, as someone who was in there for the mission part of it, I found that rather distressful,"""" Wool told EPICENTER.
Wales did not immediately respond to a request for comment.""",0.14285714285714285

 More To Benjiboi 

You wrote on the Sanchez article discussion thread:

 For those looking for the information, Sanchez apparently used to place ads as """"Excellent Top"""" and he a related website http://excellent-top.com/, the access which has since been blocked by the site owner. This is likely the same ad referenced in the Colmes interview and comparing information from the porn site before it was removed unearthed some pretty compelling information but I'm not sure if it warrants much research but it matches information to a Matt Ayala Sanchez with the same birthdate. So might be worth including if reliable sources confirm.

This is incorrect. Sanchez ran Excellent-Top from 1999 to 2002. Then he went into business as """"No Regrets Massage"""" in New York. The phone number from the """"No Regrets Massage"""" ads, which ran in the New York Blade for most of 2004, is where Alan Colmes contacted Sanchez. My partner reached him at the same number. All of this is detailed on my partner's website, which was termed a """"hate site"""" by Elonka and the other senior Wikipedia administrators and editors because it called Sanchez a fool.

My partner thinks Sanchez is a fool, and said so. I agree with my partner, and more. Having an opinion about a set of facts does not invalidate the facts. There is no need for you to reinvent the wheel. All the facts are at that website. Sanchez knows it, and so do the powers-that-be at Wikipedia. They are determined to keep those facts out of the article and drive away anyone who brings them to light, no matter what Wikipedia's rules might say to the contrary.  """,0.0

If the Spain-Republic of Ireland match ends at a draw of 2–2 or higher, Spain and Republic of Ireland will advance due to higher number of goals from games among teams in question. If the draw game is goalless, Italy will advance with a higher number of goals among teams in question while Spain and Republic of Ireland still tie. As reapplying the tiebreaker on the game between Spain and Republic of Ireland doesn't help, Spain will advance (with Italy) with a higher overall goal difference.

"Composition of the list (table) 

1. Removed the info on Falcon X Heavy and Falcon XX, since those are just proposed concepts that haven't yet reached nowhere near the project stage. 2. Removed the info stating that Saturn INT-21 had one launch. It has never flown, the booster used for Skylab was an actual Saturn V with the 3rd stage modified into Skylab itself. The entry for Saturn INT-21 should probably be deleted altogether, but unlike two heavy Falcons it was under development coming much closer to becoming an operational vehicle, so I'm not sure. 3. Added clarification to Space Shuttle entry that it is regarded here as an integrated launch system, and not a standalone heavy booster, also removed the note stating:  'Like Soviet Energia-Buran system, despite of integrated design of rocket and orbiter, US Space Shuttle may be comparatively considered as launcher for such superheavy payload as manned spaceplane. But it should be noted that the orbiter could not hold more tha 25,000 kg.'  Such reasoning is not entirely justified. It can be considered as such only with serious reservations, since Shuttle's Orbiter acts de facto as a returnable third stage which cannot be replaced with anything else and has to be brought back to Earth, whereas other boosters can hypothetically (or practically, like Saturn V - Skylab case) have the load they put in LEO modified.  And certainly the Shuttle system cannot be part of this comparative list based on similarity with Energia-Buran (the note says 'like Soviet Energia-Buran system') since Enegia booster could be adapted to carry basically any appropriately configured and balanced payload piggybacked on its side, not just the orbiter.",0.0

Moving the page is not really worth while, but a recognition of the alternative name in the text seems to make sense to me.

On the subject of the proposed merge with ancient egyptian multiplication, the two techniques, while relying on the same fundemental mathematical principal, are very different in practice.

 Recent page moves (see also: unresolved discussion above regarding this issue) 
OK  I don't understand why this is an issue, unless you all figure that this article deserves some sort-of 'special exception' to Wikipedia's rules of article naming and precedent. If so inclined, click: French Jews, German Jews, Russian Jews, and so forth on in to perpetuity. ALL of these names REDIRECT to the """"History of the Jews in [country]"""" articles, i.e. they DO NOT have their own special article on this topic (even though, for whatever reason, THIS page on """"Jews and Judaism in the United States"""" IS indeed a separate entity from the """"History of the Jews in the United States"""" page, not to mention separate from the Lists of American Jews [also wrong titled, differs from category name], and separate from Category:Jewish Americans [correct category name]). DO YOU ALL NOW SEE WHAT A COMPLETE AND UTTER MESS YOU HAVE MADE OF THESE JEWS AND JUDAISM RELATED AMERICAN ARTICLES AND CATEGORIES because of all of the wayward and entirely unneeded article/category moves and counter-moves, renames and counter-renames?  I merely seek to fix (standardize) all of this, nothing more.  Please help me to do this, and please stop engaging in these senseless/childish edit wars and continuing to revert and/or disregard my good moves and valid information.

There are many article/category naming irregularities still out there (found in Judaism by country [maybe we start there?] such as Italian Jews, but I'm about to fix that), but we need to stick to ONE naming scheme for ALL Jewish articles, and so far the category naming scheme """"Jews and Judaism in [country]"""" (as opposed to """"History of the Jews in [country]"""") is the most widespread and used, thus it can be regarded as a precedent (or is one used for the category, one for the actual article?). The confusing part is that, like I just hinted at, in some cases we have """"History of the Jews in [country]"""" pages, along with """"Jews and Judaism in [country]"""" pages (plus tons of categories with same name, which User:IZAK has been standardizing to some extent), along with the list articles like List of German Jews, List of British Jews, and so forth. So, maybe we need to start a discussion and approve a policy of article name STANDARDIZATION and PRECEDENT than can be followed in the future as they relate to ALL of these disparate yet related pages (Jews/Judaism in [country], History of Jews in [country], List of [national] Jews, all related to the standard category naming scheme """"Jews and Judaism in [country]""""). Per User:IZAK's recent moves involving the Swiss and Norwegian Jew articles I thought that this was and has been the accepted norm/precedent, but now I am being reverted for moving this article to its similar name, yet of course no one objects to IZAK's moves at all. If I am doing something wrong here, by all means please let me know  however, I am just trying to improve the overall naming and organizational scheme of this article and indeed all of the Category:Jews and Judaism by country (Judaism by country) articles/categories as a whole.

Also...Jayjg, why do you keep reverting the List of Jewish Americans to List of American Jews even though ALL of the actual lists found in that master list are still named """"List of Jewish American [profession]"""" as they should be, a hold-over from the olden days when these article/category names weren't in such a state of disorganization and disarray?

Revisionism, strictly speaking, is where you take an established idea and discount it based on new evidence.

"""personal view of """"fire in the lake"""" is that it is a dated political tract written at a time (1972?) before many sources were available to write any kind of history. Especially any history about events in North Vietnam during the 1950s. The author of the book further makes all kinds of statements about Vietnamese that with distance sound condiscending or even worse. When the book starts talking about the Vietnamese mind, its almost embarrasing to read it. Yes, it won awards when it was published. But its a very flawed book. For example, the basis of your claim that only 800 people died in the anti-landlord campaign is that her North Vietnamese/NLF friends told the author so. By contrast, Stanley Karnow writing in 1983, was writing in a less hysterical political climate and had access to more material than was available in 1972.

"Moved to draft space==
I've moved this copypasted pastiche to draft space as it wasn't ready for mainspace.   A few points to remember:

There is nothing to split from the cuisine of Hawaii article.  Splitting occurs when we have too much content and some must be moved elsewhere.  That is not the situation here.  There is nothing to remove from the parent topic.  
What was recommended is for an editor to take up the task of expanding the subject, spinning out the topic into a new daughter article.  This involves an editor who is willing and interested to research and write about the cuisine of Native Hawaiian and to give it an expanded scope and treatment in a larger space.  This means expanding what we already have, not moving it to another article and adding more copypaste from other articles.  Writing means, doing the research, reading the books and scholarly papers, and doing the hard work.  It does not mean taking what we already have and duplicating it over and over again.  That's not how this works.
You basically duplicated the entire cuisine of Hawaii article here.  Since that's a completely different topic, it makes no sense to talk about ethnic and local cuisine here.  If you don't know what the cuisine of Native Hawaii entails, then do the research.  It does not mean any food that anyone of Native Hawaiian ethnicity eats.  It has a specific, pre-contact definition and scope.
When you copied the content, you also copied the sources without adding the actual references.  As a result,  nobody can easily verify the content.  Of course, I can, since I'm the one that went to the library and found the books and cited them in the original article.  You will have to add each full source to this article, otherwise it will get moved back to draft/sandbox space again.  You can't just keep copying material without doing the hard work.  You will need to add each single full reference to this article.  Don't expect others to cleanup after you, especially when other editors did the actual research and footwork you refuse to do.
Per the MOS, please do not surround text with multiple images.  Candleabracadabra, you've been reminded of this many times now.  

Keep this in draft space until you've done the necessary work.  This will involve serious research on your part. It will not involve copying and pasting material from already existing articles.

"There were four relatively modern heavy ships sunk, the German BC was lost to uncontrollable flooding forward.  The three British BC were lost because they were packed from the turret to the magazines with uncased cordite charges with igniter pads leaking gunpowder.  Cordite, if it began to deteriorate (and it could do so very quickly) had a tendency to explode if exposed to shock, and a shell through the turret armor would more than provide that.  So, lack of deck armor didn't have a thing to do with the loss of the British BC's.  the lack of turret face/roof armor did have a great deal to do with it, as did unsafe cordite handling.  Now had the BC's been subjected to long range plugning fire it would have been another story, however the armoring system until USS Nevada didn't provide for in any BC or Dreadnought design.",0.0

Okay with regards to that last little comment: How about you try choking on my balls you over 
excitable ancient. Forgive my antagonism but I give only as much as I receive, and I have most 
certainly received a substantial quantity from you. You may try to come across as a cool headed and fair moderator. In reality I would liken you more to a tyrant; nay to an immature little boy, despite your years (oh and so many of them there are). Without hardly a glance you toss aside any changes you can't verify with the limitless tome you assume your mind to be. And what of those whose revisions you've mindlessly reverted, you dispatch to them on mass pseudo-endearments and generic warnings such as the one seen above. I will admit to you that I have committed much wiki-vandalism in the past such as my early editing of Neil Peart but how is it that you cannot overlook the past and accept the legitimate revisions and improvements I and others have been making. I stand by my edit regarding Charles Nohh though I have given up trying to penetrate you tightly closed mind (which I will add in my rage is quite the adverse of what I would say about your wife). Furthermore having calmed myself I should mention a little about who I am. If you can recall (Of this there is little hope) you once likened my writing to that found in """"chat-rooms"""" and believe me when I say I did not LOL over that comment. I was at the time of our encounter studying a BA with a major in Creative English Writing. You should note before you jump to the conclusion that I dropped out as I suspect you would in your typical """"angry"""" way: not only have I graduated, I continued my study for a further year and obtained honors. I was working at the time as a contributor to a Wellington Based Music Interest Magazine, and had convinced the Fuehrer (my editor) to publish an article I wrote on Rush. It was while I was researching for this article that I came across the information which I added to the Neil Peart article. So thanks to you my small contribution was only read by the handful of New Zealanders who read my work, when it could have informed in whatever small way the countless many who may have stumbled upon it on the internet. So Thank YOU Anger22. It is your obsession with reversion resulting I must assume in a complete disregard of duty to family or perhaps a complete disconnection from the living world, I say again it is this obsession which keeps this website from being everything it should be. Thank for your tireless efforts. Thank for your senseless, heartless, worthless, and above all tireless efforts. I really do hate you.""",0.14285714285714285

"Well you ask good questions.  But you don't seem to realize that Greece was far from neutral:  it was squarely on the side of the British.

As for Calvocoressi et al, the text speaks for itself.  I guess one synthesis is as follows:  Greece could have, like I believe Hácha's government in Czechoslovakia in 1939, authorized capitulation to the Germans, and avoided the bloodshed of the Athens occupation and more so the Battle of Crete.  But this is alternative history.  And besides the Greek resistance was a moral boost for the allies, even if you don't believe that (as most neutral historians do not) it delayed much, if at all, German's invasion of Russia.",0.0

"""CCD affecting other insects?==
While all this is certainly entertaining, the qoute does not stand on its own in that even if all honeybee populations collapse, mankind will not disappear. Wild pollinator insects, animals, and even wind can still pollinate many even most edible food crops. Even if those crops that depend solely on domestic bee pollenation cannot be produced any longer, humans would adapt agriculture to fill those niches.  

At this point it's not clear yet that CCD only affects bees.  It certainly stands to reason that other insects could be affected by the same disorder.  Also, the quote may be overly simplified.  But the big picture is that without pollinators, things are much more difficult. 

I have not seen any references that have indicated that wild bee populations, wild pollinators or other insects have been affected by the same disorder. If you know of any references that cite a similar decline in native or wild pollinators it may be helpful to include a section on this. 
Wild bees are generally becoming rare in the Western world due to habitat destruction. This is AFAIK most severe in C Europe.  
I agree that wild bees are increasingly rare worldwide, but the cause has little if anything to do with colony collapse.  
""""Little if anything""""? The proper and correct response is it has nothing to do with CCD. Even in the event that CCD should prove to be a """"disease"""", diseases are rather specific in what they affect, and a disease that affects honey bees is unlikely to affect any other insects; and there are only 7 species of honey bees. It's like expecting that a disease that affects deer will spread to other mammals, such as humans. That is an unreasonable expectation - it most definitely does NOT """"stand to reason that other insects could be affected by the same disorder"""" - the reality is exactly the opposite. The seven species in the genus Apis have had something on the order of 35 million years of independent evolution - 35 million years for their genomes to diverge from those of all other insects; compare that to the 70 million years mammals have existed. The human genome has had about as much time to diverge from deer, as the honey bee genome has had to diverge from other bees. But no one expects humans and deer to be affected by the same diseases. Why should a honey bee disease affect other bees?
While it is certainly true that habitat destruction and climate change are major threats to pollinating insects, bees foremost among them, CCD, even in a worst-case scenario, is not a threat to anything outside of agriculture.

 Tram and trolleybus articles 

Thanks for your comments.  I have been a big fan of electric powered urban and rail transport, particularly in continental Europe, since the early 1980s, and that, of course, is the subject matter of the newly translated template (and the articles that are and will be linked to it).

Until recently, en.wiki did not have anywhere near as good a coverage of Italian rail topics as it should have.  Although I can't speak Italian, and can barely read it, translating Italian is relatively easy with the assistance of Google translator.  Since November last year, I have therefore translated approximately 100 articles about individual Italian railway stations.  Now that almost all of the important stations are covered in en.wiki, the it.wiki articles about Italian tram networks and trolleybus systems seemed to be the logical next step.

Since I started work on my latest project, I have also discovered that there is very comprehensive coverage of individual tramway networks and trolleybus systems in de.wiki, so I will start translating some of the de.wiki articles soon.  In the meantime, I have just created one very long overdue en.wiki article, Trams in Milan (not fully translated as yet), and will be creating another long overdue article in the next few days.

Which brings me to a query about nomenclature.  There's quite a bit of material on both it.wiki and de.wiki about individual classes of trams (and trolleybuses).  However, I'm not sure how translations of those articles should be named.  If an article is about a generic make and model (eg Siemens Desiro), then it can just be named as """"make model"""".  But if a tram class is unique to a particular network, the issue of naming is less clear.  There are several en.wiki articles about Australian trams that are named in the following form: W-class Melbourne tram.  However, that form doesn't seem right to me.  I would suggest that a more appropriate form would be Milan series 1500 tram, which is a form consistent with the naming of many articles about locomotives (eg British Rail Class 47).  What do you think?   """,0.0

In following the wikipedia guidleline concerning academic boosting  , removal of the words like excellence and prominence have been a problem.  Although statements like """"least happy students"""" may appear to be a slap in the face, it is something that the school has actually been ranked in.  There are numerous guides including the US News and World Report and the Princeton review being the biggest ones rate and rank accoding to numerous subjective guidelines.   Even the school newspaper ranks speaks about St. John's rankings in the newspaper and praises it's inclusion. .  The good and the bad gives a fair perspective.  Simply stating what is good white washes history and is unencyclopedic.  It's like Duke blanking out the lacrosse rape scandal, or UNLV not speaking about the it's NCAA violations.    .  St. John's university along with stony brook are notable to have included the least happy students..  There has been no removal of the top 10 wireless ranking that St. John' has been given, so there isn't any NPOV violations.

 Background section 

At the present time, the """"background"""" section cites unspecified interviews with the media, according to which, Ahmed claimed to """"take apart a clock and rebuild it inside a pencil case.""""

The sentence is taken verbatim from the NPR article. However, it links to a Dallas News article, which says no such thing, to a Dallas News interview, which also does not contain this statement, and mentions a WFAA interview, which I've been unable to find. I've checked four different interviews with Ahmed and he does not explicitly describe it as a rebuilt clock in any of them.

If such an interview exists and the statement was not an interpolation by NPR, it would be nice to have a direct link, a quote and a date.

The problem with the statement is that it provides inadequate background for the rest of the article. When the story broke on 9/15, the device was consistently described by the media as """"a homemade clock"""" or """"an invention"""".  The fact that it was a reassembled commercial clock was mentioned in passing by a WFAA article (which quoted Irving police) on 9/16 but otherwise mostly ignored. It only went """"viral"""", so to speak, when Dawkins waded into the controversy on 9/20 and his comments got picked up by the conservative media.

Much of the immediate reaction, from Obama's tweet and Zuckerberg's invitation to Dawkins' lashing out, seems inexplicable if the device in question was acknowledged to be a rebuilt commercial clock from day 1, but makes sense if the device was initially assumed by everyone to be a genuine homemade clock.

I have recently visited the page User talk:Rtyags, and I notice you issued a warning for an """"unconstructive test edit"""". Looking at the edit in question, all Rtyags did was to add an extra bowler to the """"Most Wickets"""" table due to Zaheer Khan (the 6th bowler) having the same number of wickets as bowlers 4 and 5. You might not have agreed with this change (given that the purple cap award has a tie-breaker for when bowlers are on equal wickets), but this was arguably a positive edit and clearly not a test edit. Please do not give warnings to people simply because they have made an edit that they thought was warrented but that you did not.

 I reverted it back because I preferred the original version before Rod Ball's edits.  I asked if anyone else agreed with Rod Ball on this issue - having gotten no response, I assumed that other people either didn't care, or like me preferred the original.  In addition, I believe that Pjacobi already reverted these particular edits once.

 So I'll ask again - does anybody agree with Rod Ball on this issue, and actually prefer his version?  I like it the way it is now.  To make it less personal, do people like http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bell%27s_spaceship_paradox&oldid;=79349924 or http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bell%27s_spaceship_paradox&oldid;=79587575

 I think that """"a family of paradoxes"""" is more technically accurate, if you re-read the literature section you'll see why Hillman (the originator of this wording) described them this way.  Different authors have analyzed slightly different situations using different means.

 I also think accelerated rods are quite relevant and related (again, I borrowed this from Hillman, though I added the wiki-link to Born rigid motion).  Note that we are currently arguing accelerated motion with Rod Ball.  I would say that the topic is therfore closely related, though not identical.  That's just what the intro says.  Strings and spaceships share much of the same physics as rods and spaceships, in the final analysis.  It's fundamentally about distance.

 I think both versions contain equivalent information in explaining why the paradox, originated by Dewan and Beran, is named after Bell.   """,0.0

Can you prove that I'm wrong?  Not only that my sword isn't the real thing, but that my claiming it is is such a travesty, that you cannot allow anyone else to see it at all?  I wonder what would happen, if the other Wikipedophiles got their poor little minds corrupted by a comment on a talk page, eh?

 IMPORTANCE Of PHOEBE 

Shouldn't it be noted that Phoebe kicks and punches are stronger than an ordinary human. For example; in the episode """"Importance of Phoebe"""" Phoebe couldnt fight off the shape-shifting demon due to a spell that removed her magic, but when her magic powers returned she kicked the demon without levitating several feet back. So should this be considered magically amped martial-arts, extension of levitation, or super-strength.

"""

I have several points regarding the recent discussion.  1) I believe that BruceHallman's statement that the phrase """"generally assocatied with the United State's princples and interests"""" conforms to WP:V, WP:NPOV AND WP:NOR is incorrect.  First, I believe that the Heritage foundation source he uses, as pointed out by David Oberst, is not being interperted correctly.  Simply because countries that are rated """"free"""" by Freedom House are generally more supportive of United States interests does not mean that Freedom House's rating are generally associated with United State's intersts.  After all, the long-time US ally Saudi Arabia is treated very harshly by Freedom House.  The summary of the Heritage foundation report does not accurately reflect the assertions in the report which in fact states the opposite, """"As nations become freer, both politically and economically, the policies that they consider to be in their interests become more closely aligned with policies championed by the U.S.not because they are U.S. policies, but because they are policies consistent with the interests of free societies.""""  This means that the verification for that statement is not valid.  In addition, even if it were quoted accurately, the Heritage Foundations stated goal is to """"formulate and promote conservative public policies;"""" they are not a neutral source.  (Indeed, most of the sources for this artical are not neutral sources but are sources with strong bias one way or the other.)  Citing other's opinions, while they are verifiable, does not make them neutral.  
2) BruceHallman is correct, however, in questioning Ultramarine's suggestion that the test of if something is valid is if it reflects how Freedom House describes itself.  Freedom House itself is not a neutral source, and while they may be a good source for some parts of the article (such as when they were founded or who the chairman of their board is) descriptions of their ideology, goals, etc. should probably be cited as """"Freedom House's states"""" etc.  Simply because Freedom House doesn't describe itself a certian way doesn't necessarly mean that it isn't valid.
3) Saying that Freedom House is """"generally associated with US interests"""" isn't necessarly a critisim; however, it is not a statement of fact, either.  Merely the fact that it has been debated so much on this talk page indicates that it is not a verifiable fact, but rather a matter of some contention.  I will outline how I think the article could be better constructed to include the differing opinions of Freedom House in the next bullet point, but I think that the introduction should probably be saved for things that are clearly true, and not things that are up for debate.
4) I feel that if the article is restructured slightly and the primary editors of this article (which, lately, seem to be BruceHallman and Ultramarine, who clearly have different views of Freedom House as an organization) could agree on this structure, it would save a lot of debate.  I think the introduction of the article should state basic, verifiable facts (What they are, where they are headquartered, where they are located, and the fact that they are best known for publishing books).  A statement saying that their political agenda is a matter of contention might also be included to indicate not everyone things that they are all sunshine and roses.  I think the next section should be """"History and Organization"""" and outline when and by whom they were founded, it's organization structure, the fact that the board is mostly American, it's funding, and it's membership in other organization.  I think that the bit about what their activities (both in the historical section and in the organization section with the quote) should be moved to the next section, """"Activities.""""  The Activities (though that is maybe a bad heading) would include the above statements of what Freedom House's claims of prior activities are, the fact that they publish book and details of those books, and the information contained in the """"other activities"""" section.  The final section, I think should be titled something along the lines of """"Political Leanings, Agenda, and Controversy"""" or something, and would be a space for the differing views of Freedom House to be discussed.  The validity (or lack their of) of their ratings, if they are bias in favor of an Ameri-centric point of view, and if they are neo-cons or not could be discussed here.  If the proceding sections are well written, they will be limited to things that can be easily verified, and all the debate about if Freedom House is good or bad will be contained in this section.     Calling this section """"Criticisms"""" has implications that I don't think are necessarly correct.

though your suggestion is appreciated, it's a bit presumptuous.   I use the """"Shoe preview"""" button ACTUALLY QUITE A BIT, overall, in articles.   The problem, Nova, is that you think somehow that I was just birthed on WP from a cabbage truck, and no next to nothing about policy and options.    I don't always use """"Show preview"""", but I have used that option almost 50% of the time on articles.  I never even wanted to be an editor on WP, it happened ACCIDENTALLY.....because all the 4 articles (not many) that I created on WP were articles I thought would be there already.

If I WANTED to be a big shot on WP, with many created articles, and thousands of edited articles, I could....but I DO NOT WANT TO.       I don't really care that much.

 Swastika as a mnemonic device http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html 

The article needs more information about the swastika's use as a modern mnemonic device. Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, Professor Rex Curry discovered that it was also used sometimes by the National Socialist German workers Party as alphabetic symbolism, including meshed """"S"""" letters for their """"socialism."""" The leader of German National Socialists at that time altered his own signature to use the same stylized """"S"""" letter for """"socialist"""" and similar alphabetic symbolism still shows on Volkswagens.  Professor Curry showed that many modern myths use a false belief that Nazis called themselves """"Nazis.""""  The myths cause widespread ignorance of the eytmology of the word """"Nazi."""" Party members called themselves """"National Socialists,"""" not """"Nazis.""""  Dr. Curry showed that many modern myths about swastikas use the false belief that Nazis called their symbol a """"swastika.""""  German National Socialists did not call their symbol a """"swastika.""""  Another person conceded the point with the comment that """"It does seem to be the case that the National Socialist German Workers' Party originated the 45° orientation...."""" though they did not necessarily originate that use, the German National Socialists did independently alter their use of the symbol for their specific desire to highlight the """"S"""" letter for """"socialism."""" Of course, the additional comment that they didn't use the 45 degree orientation consistently also concedes Professor Curry's work showing that their leader deliberately altered / evolved the symbol from its historic orientation into meshed """"S"""" letters for socialism. The graphic resonance is highly suggestive... and in fact it is compelling! In fact, one of the flags that Dr. Curry cites argues for that thesis: The swastika itself comprises two S's, and that is shown to have been known consciously when the German National Socialists overlay two additional S's for another group (as German National Socialists had other examples of similar alphabetic symbolism). Hitler even altered his own signature to reflect the same """"S"""" for socialism and similar alphabetic symbolism still shows on Volkswagens. http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html The leader of the German Socialists had no reason to harp on this idea because he was an ex-artist. Nevertheless, he did allude to the alphabetic symbolism in his own comments in his notorious book. Of course, he would not drone on about it just as he did not drone on about what the stylized """"SA"""" symbol meant, or the side-by-side """"SS"""" symbol, or the """"VW"""" (all of which other writers concede for some inconsistent reason). The only reason it is so hard for most people to understand today is because they have been trained to use the hackneyed shorthand for the Party and most people are ignorant of the name of the actual Party, and thus have no idea that the Party actually espoused a dogma that they called """"Socialism.""""

However Guettarda has already said most of what I would say, so if you've read his comments you already know most of my thoughts on the matter. I'll just comment on Manning's point about the first editor's spelling policy usage. Modern editors should bear in mind that, as Manning says, spelling/naming policy in those days was not quite the ironclad matter that it has now become. In fact the Manual of Style was originally someone's """"pet project"""". Initially following its precepts was optional. Hence many of us only adopted its prescriptions as it became increasingly obvious that not to do so would cause friction with those who took it as gospel. So at that time we did occasionally move articles from one regional variation to another. For instance I moved British """"Hoarding"""" to American """"Billboard"""" where it still remains without any complaint from anyone about """"first contributor"""". So, yes, """"first contributor"""" is an excellent way to solve these types of dispute.

SUPREME COURT, STATE OF COLORADO 

No. 98SA447 

ORIGINAL PROCEEDING IN DISCIPLINE 

January 25, 1999 

IN THE MATTER OF FRED BAUDER 

EN BANC ATTORNEY SUSPENDED 

Linda Donnelly, Attorney Regulation Counsel 

James C. Coyle, Assistant Attorney Regulation Counsel 

Denver, Colorado 

Fred Bauder, Pro Se 

Crestone, Colorado 

PER CURIAM 

In this lawyer discipline case, a hearing panel of the supreme court grievance committee approved the findings and recommendation of the hearing board. The board and the panel recommended that the respondent, Fred Bauder, be suspended for thirty days, be required to petition for reinstatement, and pay certain costs before again being allowed to practice law. We accept the recommendation. 

I. 

Fred Bauder was licensed to practice law in Colorado in 1976. He failed to answer the formal complaint filed in this case and the hearing board entered a default against him. The allegations of fact contained in the complaint were therefore deemed admitted. See C.R.C.P. 241.13(b); People v. Paulson , 930 P.2d 582, 582 (Colo. 1997). Based on the default and the evidence presented, the hearing board found that the following had been established by clear and convincing evidence. 

On July 14, 1997, we publicly censured Bauder for soliciting for prostitution during a phone call with the wife of a dissolution of marriage client. See People v. Bauder , 941 P.2d 282, 283 (Colo. 1997). Bauder was ordered to pay the costs of that proceeding in the amount of $2,058.97 within thirty days of the date on the opinion. See id. at 283-84. He did not pay the costs as ordered, however, or file a motion for an extension of time to comply with our order. Moreover, Bauder failed to respond to a letter from the Office of Disciplinary Counsel and has not explained or justified his noncompliance with the order. As a result, a request for investigation was filed against him. Bauder did not respond to the request for investigation. 

The hearing board concluded that Bauder knowingly disobeyed an order of this court in violation of Colo. RPC 3.4(c); and that his conduct also violated Colo. RPC 8.4(d) (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice) and C.R.C.P. 241.6(7) (failing to cooperate in a disciplinary investigation). 

II. 

The hearing panel approved the board's recommendation that Bauder be suspended for thirty days, be required to petition for reinstatement, and as a further condition of reinstatement, demonstrate that he has paid the costs incurred in the 1997 proceeding. 

Under the ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions (1991 & Supp. 1992) (ABA Standards ), """"[s]uspension is appropriate when a lawyer knowingly violates a court order or rule, and there is injury or potential injury to a client or a party, or interference or potential interference with a legal proceeding."""" ABA Standards 6.22. However, disbarment is warranted when a lawyer """"(a) intentionally or knowingly violates the terms of a prior disciplinary order and such violation causes injury or potential injury to a client, the public, the legal system, or the profession."""" Id. at 8.1(a). 

The 1997 public censure is an aggravating factor for analyzing the proper level of discipline. See id. at 9.22(a). Other aggravating factors include Bauder's refusal to acknowledge the wrongfulness of his conduct, see id. at 9.22(g); his substantial experience in the practice of law, see id. at 9.22(i); and his indifference to making restitution, see id. at 9.22(j). Because Bauder did not appear at the hearing or offer any evidence, no mitigating factors were found. 

The lawyer respondent has defaulted and apparently ignored the disciplinary proceedings. We elect to accept the board's recommendation. See People v. Rishel , 956 P.2d 542, 544 (Colo. 1998). We are satisfied that the requirement that the respondent undergo reinstatement proceedings and demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that he is again fit to practice law will adequately protect the public. Accordingly, we accept the recommendations of the hearing board and panel. One member of the court, however, would impose more severe discipline. 

III. 

It is hereby ordered that Fred Bauder is suspended from the practice of law for thirty days, effective thirty days after the issuance of this opinion. It is further ordered that, prior to seeking reinstatement a",0.0

 FISHERQUEEN ( Actually A TRASHY DUSTBIN ) IS BLOCKED IN LIFE FOREVER AND FOR LIFE INDEFINITELY 

 FISHERQUEEN IS ACTUALLY A TRASHY DUSTBIN WHO IS BLOCKED IN LIFE AND FOR LIFE INDEFINITELY

It can be so obviously seen that you have no life in reality and hence you carry on with editing pages on Wikipedia,which is another big joke, like you. In fact, it is jokers like you that make Wikipedia an unreliable piece of crap that the world laughs on. You thought you can block users who edit articles that are wrongly written to project a """"good"""" image like that C-grade item song sleaze actress Payal Rohatgi. On the account of hello5678, when I edited to write the truth, since I work with the media and knew the actual truth, you did what you knew best - to block accounts and even have the foolish audacity to write that it did not seem I was a journalist. Your block anyways went futile ( like all your remaining blocks on other users go, and future blocks will be going ) since as I had said, there are a million computers to comment and reply from. It just depends on my wish if I want to respond to idle losers like you and whether I have the time to do so. Once and for all, I am doing it this time, and won't remove time for worthless people like you again.
 
You had some advice on how I should spend my """"blocked time"""" by reading WP:Dispute pages on Wikipedia so that I have better ideas on dealing with disputes. Actually ,you need better ideas to deal with life. I am not foolish like you to spend any amount of my time bothering about rubbish written by stupid people like you who have no work in real life and spend days editing pages on Wikipedia/ Scribblebook that no one bothers to read. Some people are just unfortunate like you and 2over0. And if you are troubled by my calling that actress """"sleazy"""", then that's your problem. Cos that's the only work she has done and the press uses precisely that term while referencing her work. You also spoke about writing """"accurate"""" information on wikipedia. Ironic, when you don't even bother finding out what is accurate, and spend endless hours blocking, and acting admin as if it is an important position in your life. Oh wait, that may be the only position you probably have or will have ever in your unfortunate life.
 
Carry on with your scribble game. And if you feel threatened by media exposure, then that shows you knew you were wrong. It's only when people are wrong that they feel threatened. Pity your personality. Also, you ended by writing that """" it's clear you aren't a journalist, and have no means of carrying out your threat """" - LOL. Sad, that you lived in that illusion. For JOKERS like you who are totally idle,and who scribble away in virtual pages on Wiki-scribble-pedia, will obviously withdraw from the truth. You yourself have no idea at all if I am a journalist, and you write that it's clear that I am not. Well, you are also inane and a clown to fool yourself. I had all means, and the said article has already been published. I had NO TIME to let you know, since I am a busy person, unlike you and do not find time to come scribble on virtual pages that clowns like you , 2OVERO, 2/0, AKERANS, MANAGERARC, FISHERQUEEN (yeah, we named you again - Suck it up),  KURU etc. do all your life. You will find that information, depending on which Godforsaken part of the world you live in.  And like last time, you can go ahead and block me this time too. For , no one cares two hoots for your silly blocking games. We do have a life, unlike losers like you. Maybe its time for you to go fish in real life, so that you can come anywhere remotely close to having a life - LOL.
SO, LOSERQUEEN, GROW UP and GET A LIFE, You IDLE CLOWN OR ELSE, YOU WILL REMAIN A LOSER ALL YOUR LIFE. WHO CARES ANYWAY WHAT INANE, PUERILE LOSERS LIKE YOU DO IN THEIR LIVES. Cos all you know best is to play edit and block games on your scribblebook called wikipedia. Scribble on cos anyway no one cares and I most certainly don't. Time for you to go fishing then, LOSERQUEEN. And I wont bother to check any replies or anything else ever, cos I dont have time unlike Idle LOSERS like you, Loserqueen. You are no where near a queen, but certainly are a huge ,filled with trash, dustbin. Pity you, unfortunate daft-LOSER- DUSTBIN.

"Yoruba population and % 

Yoruba population is above 40 million . My reason is base of govt figures. Please visit http://www.nigpost.com to see villages, town and cities in Nigeria. Please Note that that yoruba fall into 9 state. Count the number of villages, town and cities in nigeria and compare this with the yoruba figure of Oyo, ogun, ondo, ekiti, osun, lagos, kwara, Part of Kogi, and part of edo state. You would see that the yoruba have about 40% of the settlement in Nigeria. And when you compare comparison statictics from the office of statictics from radiom sample.

Why isn't he a villain? He was the bad guy - capturing the Doctor and the Dalek, torturing both, willing to sacrifice his men... even though he was a bit helpless at the end and had a slight change of heart, he was definitely sharing the villain spot with the Dalek.  13:02, Jun 17, 2005 (UTC)

Doctor Who edits

I simply clean up edits - I am a bit more ruthless than most when it comes to Doctor Who, but that's because I want to have the articles to a particular standard, and most times I do give reasons for reversions and edits. If you have any issues with those reversions you are more than welcome to take your reasons to talk and let the other editors chime in on them. If you want me to clarify my edits, you are also more than welcome to ask me and I will do my best to explain them.  08:21, Jun 20, 2005 (UTC)

Daleks hovering as kneeling
You don't need a license. What you need to do is back up your edits with evidence. If you can point to me a clear piece of on screen evidence that says that the Daleks are hovering around him in worship, please do. Take that to the Talk:Dalek page.  16:57, Jun 20, 2005 (UTC)

You can't argue from contra-evidence because there could be any number of explanations. They could have been simply guarding him (higher ground is tactically better). They could have been invisibly recharging from him. The production team could have thought it simply looked cool. Point is, you don't know for sure, and it is fallacious to phrase it as definitive when that is the case. If you still want to discuss it, take it to Talk:Dalek, and we can see what the others think about it.  17:09, Jun 20, 2005 (UTC)",0.0

You could take your images with a black background and remove it using Photoshop or GIMP. You're probably right about OsO4, although it is possible to show  a bit of packing. Not necessary though, molecular structures are mostly about the molecule! I respectfully disagree that space-filling models are less desirable than ball-and-stick models. Graphite intercalation compound is a prime example! You can see the way the potassium atoms prop open the graphite layers. Both styles are complementary - although in some cases, one may be much clearer.

Thanks for adding the reference to File:Rutile-unit-cell-3D-balls.png. I've updated the image description. I think it's important to give the source that was actually used for the image, rather than any convenient reference that seems to say the same thing. Sometimes there are differences or mistakes in sources that we don't notice until later.

You make a good point about noting atom colours explicitly. I will start to do that in my image descriptions. It's not always practical, though, to add a caption. Chemboxes are a notable example. And often, it is easy to deduce which atom is which colour, e.g. phosphorus pentafluoride!

It's less objectionable, but I still have a small problem with it.  The basic problem is that is seems to imply the the PRC """"owns"""" say the history of Tang Dynasty.  Also,
it doesn't really take into account current events.  One of
the things that the PRC government has been doing in the past year has been to """"delink"""" the concept of the PRC from the concept of China.  You can see this in the response to Chen Shuibian that was issued today where the PRC was

I'll probably drop out of the discussion for a few days and
let other people comment (as well as try to articulate better what still bothers me about the page).

 User:Roadrunner

 Ok, we're moving towards a solution, so that's good. As for the Tang dynasty (though I think you mean it more genral), I think that Taiwan did not form part of the Tang empire. Anyway, there's nothing against mentioning the Tang dynasty at Taiwan as well.

 We may indeed specifically include (in the history? header? """"disclaimer""""?) that the PRC avoids linking its name to China. Then again, it may de-link it formally, but all those people around the world will continue to associate the two. 

 I'll await your remaining problems with the contents, confident we'll end up with an article that satisfies the both of us (and, hopefully, """"everybody else"""").  13:07 Aug 5, 2002 (PDT)

Guys, after reading this tedious list of conversation, my sugguestion of the best way out of the naming convention of China is using those by native speakers of Chinese. As a native speaker of several dialects of Chinese, I make the following table which should help: 

How native Chinese speakers refer to:
Speakers from
Mainland China
Taiwan
HongKong
Macau

Referring to China (Mainland)
China
Mainland (daliu)
Mainland or Zhongguo Daliu (chong-gua-da-lok in Cantonese)
Mainland

Taiwan
Taiwan or Taiwan Province (the more official tone)
Taiwan
Taiwan
Taiwan

China (the culture etc., non-political issue
China
China
China
China

Most Chinese, regardless of where they are from, care less about the naming convention but some Taiwanese (like my buddy who is gonna marry next month) DO NOT WANT Mainland China to annex Taiwan and had bad impression on Chen Shuibian.

KT2

 Knowing what the Chinese call it is certainly interesting, but what is important is what the English-language people call it. 

I'm with Jeronimo. I also thought all of this already had been resolved  China should be the main article of the PRoC. It doesn't matter what they officially call it or want it to be called. English speakers call it China in overwhelming numbers. This is also the conventional short form used by the CIA and the UN and we have decided that that is what we will use for country names here. If we don't stick to that then we are expressly taking sides in political naming issues. The fact that the PRoC is currently trying to dissociate their government from """"China"""" (which seems counter intuitive for a totalitarian regime..) is an interesting thing to mention in the article on the PRoC at China. If we change the name of the article to follow political correctness of the PRoC that is an express act of support for their policy. I for one say we defer such naming matters to higher authorities such as the CIA Factbook, the UN and especially what is most commonly used by English speakers. True they are POV institutions but transcribing what they use is a passive and not express act of POV. Wikipedia is not in the business to decide what the names of nations are  other institutions are far better suited at this highly charged topic. I also think the disclaimer is way too long and bold should be replaced by italics. Any article on the PRoC sho",0.0

"Ernie Smith writes Æµ§œš¹

Æµ§œš¹, I have a point of information.  Is the “In an exclusively US context” section a part of the article being discussed?   For, in this section I find the following very misleading statement: “In 1996, the term became widely known in the U.S. owing to a controversy over a decision by the Oakland School Board to denote and recognize the primary language (or sociolect or ethnolect) of African American children attending school, and thereby to facilitate the teaching of standard English.[12] Thereafter, Ebonics seems to have become little more than an alternative term for African American Vernacular English, although one emphasizing its claimed African roots and independence from English, a term linked with the nationally discussed controversy over the decision by the Oakland School Board, and one avoided by most linguists.[13] “   I pose this question because I have just received a translation from the Romulus and Remus Linguistic Institute.   It appears there is an effort being made to cover–up some very, very inept and ersatz scholarship at Wikipedia encyclopedia by simply declaring my analysis of the Oakland Ebonics Controversy as something that pertains only to that article when in fact the words “For more details on this topic, see Oakland Ebonics controversy” , the words Oakland School Board (twice) and  ‘sociolect’, ‘ethnolect’ and ‘African American Vernacular English’ appear under the heading “In an exclusively US context”.    My analysis of the Oakland Ebonics controversy” was about  ‘Ebonics’ the langauage of limited English proficient (LEP) English language learners (ELL) of African ancestry in the OSUD African diaspora.   I maintain that when a counterfeiter puts the name ‘Rolex’ on a one jewel, gold plated, Hong Kong watch, this does not make a one jewel, gold plated, Hong Kong watch a genuine Rolex.  I likewise maintain that when ignorant white trash and dumb Negro Sheepdogs that nurse at the udder of white supremacits trash use the word Ebonics as a synonynm for and African American Vernacular English this does not make Ebonics an African American Vernacular of English.

 Articles for creation/Miriam Battista 

Hi Arctic Kangaroo,

I'm totally puzzled by the reasons you gave for rejecting this article Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation:/Miriam Battista. Miriam Battista is definitely """" 'worthy of notice' – that is, 'significant, interesting, or unusual enough to deserve attention or to be recorded'."""" It's true that her moment of national fame was short, but it was intense, and she continued to be noticed in the press as an adult actress. Also, the fact that she received a news obit (not paid for by the family) in the New York Times should in itself attest to her notability, since the obit was published so many years after her heyday. For comparison, please look at the article for Gladys Hulette. I certainly think that Battista rises to at least the same level of notability.

As far as verifiable references are concerned, I truly thought I had over-referenced if anything! There are references to Charles Donald Fox's book Famous Film Folk, Photoplay, Variety, The New Yorker, the New York Times, the Internet Broadway Database, and Internet Movie Database - are these not considered reliable, verifiable sources? If the problem is that I used too many references to privately held materials, I apologize for that, but I thought that the information they included was interesting and enlightening. I guess that raises a basic question for me: would Wikipedia prefer that information from privately held materials be omitted, even if it sheds light on the subject? If the answer is """"Yes,"""" I'm afraid that Wikipedia is missing out on a gold mine of material.

I had been considering trying to get in touch with Wikipedia editors who are working on WikiProject Biography, as well as those involved in WikiProject Film before submitting this article for review, but as a newbie I wasn't sure how to do that. Now that the article has been rejected, I would very much like to get feedback directly from anyone involved in those two projects, as well as more feedback from you. Perhaps you can show me how to connect with those projects.

Third World Comments

Bin Laden / Ahmadinejad Comments
Gibson isn't accusing Democrats of modeling themselves after Osama or Ahmadinejad, which I admit would be controversial if he did.  He did just the opposite, in fact.  He seems to be accusing the duo of modeling their pronouncements after standard talking points of the Democrats.  This is a far cry from comparing Bush to Hitler, for instance.  

France / Hip Hop Culture and the School Shoooting
His comment saying no one would care if France were nuked might be considered controversial, although it's proven not to be his """"nappy-headed ho's"""" type career damaging statement.  Every section in the criticism section has created NO RIPPLE outside of the highly partisan sections of the blogosphere, aside form his comments on the school shooting (which was mentioned in a small circulation hip-hop magazine).

For the sake of comparission, I'd like to cite Chris Matthew's June 26th edition of """"Hardball"""", where Ann Coulter was a guest.  After saying he was """"deeply concerned"""" about people who think like Coulter, many of the members in the live audience cheered.  This caused Matthews to exclaim, """"My God, is this 'Deliverance'?"""".  I personally criticize Matthews for comparing people to inbred hillbilly homosexual rapists (and not giving them a chance to defend themselves).  Yet, I'm not putting my criticism on Matthew's page.

Next she popped up at Black Dahlia, an article upon which she had never previously edited, to revert something I removed and has maintained a overly long, ridiculously drawn out discussion with editors there. At one point, Crohnie admonished her for treating her like """"an idiot or something"""". Next she popped up at Charles Manson, also an article upon which she had not previously edited, to throw herself into an issue I was involved in and making unsupported statements, which she has proceeded to edit war over. She then joined WP:CRIME, a project in which I'm active. It is quote obvious she is stalking my edits. Finally tonight, another editor came to Talk:Black Dahlia to enter a content vote, and SkagitRiverQueen made an outright accusation against me of canvassing votes, where she clearly and unequivocably said """"It's obvious that some editors have been canvassed specifically to sway the vote (and am I making an accusation here? yes, indeed, I am)."""" I asked her to withdraw her comment and her response was """"And, frankly, regardless of whether or not I can prove it, I don't believe that you *haven't* canvassed for input here."""" She was clearly challenged on this by LaVidaLoca here and Pinkadelica here. I want this editor to stop following me around, picking tenditious arguments and making specious and unfounded accusations against me. Wildhartlivie (talk) 

I endorse these comments by Wildhartlivie. I object to the specious claim that my opinion was canvassed in anyway and believe SkagitRiverQueen's intent is tenditious and assaultive in nature. For the record, she has reverted the Manson article 3 times, even after she was asked not to edit war over it. It appears to me that she is wikihounding Wildhartlivie and would take exception to anything she says or does. This is an untenable situation that needs to stop. LaVidaLoca (talk)  
As the editor who instigated the preliminary consensus vote (and as such a possible cohort in the WP:CANVASS), I must agree that this claim against Wildhartlivie is specious and unwarranted. I have attempted to instruct SkagitRiverQueen on the proper way to engage in disputes (mainly not attacking other editors based on perceived editing style). This has not worked as of yet. I do see a pattern of """"wikihounding"""" here on SkagitRiverQueen's part, as do many other editors, and this has persisted for some time. This feud must end... Doc9871 (talk)  
IMO, this is purely retaliation by Wildhartlivie for the sock-puppet investigation (exactly why it's the first thing she mentioned in the complaint even though the issue has been over and done for nearly a couple of weeks, now). Not only is she reverting practically everything I have edited recently, she is now reverting entire sections of large articles I have edited[18]. On top of that, she continues to call me by an inflammatory name (""""Skag"""" - I have noted on my User Page it is *not* an acceptible contraction of my user name; she even mentioned earlier today that she has read that admonition on my user page[19] that is a known slang term for women who have less than savory reputations[20]). Now, in addition to everything else, she has placed an """"edit war"""" warning on my talk page *after* she filed this report.[21] I am not in an edit war - and am actually trying to reason with the editor of that article who has been reverting my recent edits.[22] Wildhartlivie has publically called my mental and emotional health into question here in Wikipedia on more than one occasion. Additionally, she has a questionable history that includes abuse of her rollback privileges (see User talk:Wildhartlivie for the warning she recently received and User talk:GTBacchus for her responses to the warning), continued incivility to anyone who edits articles she watches, and canvassing her Wikipedia friends to back her up whenever her edits or actions are called into question (above content from LaVidaLoca is proof of this). And yes, I do believe she canvassed editors by email regarding the issue we have been discussing at Talk:Black Dahlia. Concerning this complaint, you will likely also hear from User:Doc9871, User:Pinkadelica, User:Crohnie, User:Rossrs, User:Vidor, and User:Equazcion - all editors she has canvassed in the past when she feels she needs support in one of her efforts to prove me wrong. Evidence of this can be found at [23], [24], [25], [26], [27]. In those instances, she out-and-out lied that I mentioned four of those editors in any fashion - yet, her",0.0

Wait.  You're not going to block me for posting an RFC?

Or did you block me just so that I couldn't go advertising the RFC on other pages where it might be relevant?

See.  There's the problem. As a non-admin, I am liable to be blackballed by admins, some of whom suffer from Projection (or do they merely think sophistry is administration?):

I performed no personal attacks.  I made analogies between admin behavior and classical abuse of power.
I was personally attacked. No admins have been blocked.

I was not trolling.  Calling me a troll is nothing but a lie designed to anger me and cause me to overreact.  It's an attempt to fabricate """"evidence"""" for a block.
At least one admin thinks my being called a troll is enough evidence, because now I am blocked. (And I seriously doubt any admin is reading this page).

I was not disrupting anything and I am not posting in any inappropriate manner.  I was discussing the problem in the forum provided.  Blocking people to stop them from winning an argument is the disruption.

There are 1,7000 admins on this thing.  I have no illusion that all 1,700 of them will be right all the time.  The first 20 who saw Chooserr's postings may have said """"okay by me"""".  It's the first one who comes along who misreads the situation who causes the problem.  One mistaken admin invalidates the opinions of 20 rational ones.  Meanwhile, a well-meaning user is punished for doing nothing wrong, demonized in the community, and the community is thrown into dysfunction.  To the point that anyone coming to their defense is treated with an egregious level of imperiousness, intimidation, sophistry, and dismissive attitude, followed by an abuse of power.

Do not block me.  Block Curps for failing to perform due diligence before injuring a user.  Block Zoe and Mysekurity for validating and amplifying Curps' error rather than taking a skeptical attitude.  Block Nandesuka for repeating the error and then attacking me for defending the oppressed individual.  And block Sean Black for either deliberately or gormlessly falling for their false accusations against me.

The behavior of the admins in this event is a classic abuse of power: a clique of bullies hiding their damage by increasing it.  """,0.14285714285714285

Vandalism Manifesto. Pass to all Wikians

VANDALISM IS GOOD. Vandalism does not come from a sheer desire to cause harm.
Vandals do their thing all over Wiki, 24/7, from frustration and hatred, 
because incompetent """"editors"""" who have no skills, no degrees, no expertise, usually no names, have done multiple reverts and edits of the work of others.
Vandalism is a good and natural response to no-lifers (as in Get a Life) who 
do 7000 edits, 10,000 edits a year and who have actual Watch Lists of 1,300
or more and are proud of it. These jerks deserve have their own pages vandalized, over and over as long as they are in effect, vandalizing the pages of others in the name of being a cop. Vandals keep no-life editors, admins, 
bureaucrats and stewards honest, or at least busy, reverting the reverts they get on their own pages. VANDALISM IS GOOD. It helps drive these nutcases into the ground with nervous breakdowns. The Culture of Wikipedia is very,very sick,
and Vandals are needed to """"cull the herd"""". SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL VANDAL.

 Comparing bronze apples to fresh sprouts 
Ah, so now you spring your little argument youve been itching for a while to do. In otherwords, 'How can Wikipedia support the supernatural claims in the Bible, and not those in my particular brand new religion.' 

First of all, Wikipedia doesnt support anything. Articles are to be written NPOV - that doesnt mean that articles dont ever use Biblespeak, rather when it is used, its used in proper context: """"In the Bible, etc. etc."""" 
This is not the Schucmanism Encyclopedia. Even if the claim that Jesus wrote the thing was universal among Christians, this is not the Christian Encyclopedia.  

Im not particularly attached to the term ghostwriting, but your wording - that [whatever it was called] is like channeling, etc - was not neutral, and placed too much emphasis on a trivial matter - trivial, because supernatural claims, despite our understanding of them in faith, are not encyclopedically substantive. 
This is of course the problem with religion - a little knowledge is a dangerous thing, and a lot of knowledge of just one thing is just plain dogma. You seem to be asserting that there is a dogmatic bias in wikipedia regarding the Bible. Its interesting, but you need to poing out specific examples, and then you need to deal with them on a case by case basis. Maybe you have a point here - I cant tell ATP. Dont forget """"the log in your own"""" BTW.

Its obviously a very touchy subject, but we deal from time to time with people seeking to push a POV in their writing, and after a while they realize that theyve already added all the information necessary to the article, but leave the writing to others. Its an important distinction - I myself have a couple times had to defer to others sometimes in cases where a conflict arose between two different POV writing styles. The question is: are yours and mine different enought to require outside help in resolving any dispute. Finally, """"Ill let you..."""" doesnt work here - its not your article, though you have had more part than anyone in developing it. And I was simply rewriting it for sake of neutral tone - something which you should welcome, not reject - as it legitimizes and adds to your work, just as your work adds to the project.

Notability of BloodSukkers
 A tag has been placed on BloodSukkers requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.    """,0.0

Hi, I have't forgotten that you wanted to discuss a bit further. I'd like that too. I'm on sort of a semi-Wiki-break right now, but, in the meanwhile, could you elaborate on
By the way, I'm interested in seeing (if you have an example in mind) an illustrative example of leveraging basis elements of a complex space that square to -1. That sounds like an interesting benefit that might normally be passed over in pure math texts.
a bit. I'm not sure exactly what you mean, and there might be no mathematical significance, but there is surely physical significance to be extracted. The complexification is made partly for convenience, partly for the Clifford algebra to actually encompass the physicist convention for the Lie algebra, and partly to encompass transformations that come from , not . Actually, not even the full  suffices. In order to encompass time reversal, one must have the set of all antilinear transformations as well. These are constructed using complex conjugation and an ordinary complex linear transformation. Best!",0.0

The law about religious symbols in school, although badly written (the proposal was to ban *all* religious symbols in primary and secondary schools) is a direct application of this one century-old philosophy as written in the constitution, so this neologism is just not adequate to describe it. This law that you call the French Hijab ban neither concerns only the Hijab, nor is a ban of the Hijab in general, I see Hijab every day when I go back to France. Also the other lies about muslim girls who would not be able to receive an education have now proven to be false, or very rare.

 as part of their contract to build out the original Arpanet.  The first multiprotocol router was created at Stanford University by a staff researcher named William Yeager  in January of 1980.  His boss at the time told him that he was the """"network guy"""" and to find a way to connect the computers in the computer science department, medical center and department of electrical engineering.  He first wrote a network operating system and routing code to run on a DEC PDP11/05.  He used Alan Snyder's Portable C compiler but it generated too much code so he modified the compiler to improve the code generators.That still wasn't good enough so he wrote an optimizer for PDP11/05 assembler that reduced the code size further.

Your recent edit at Sarahs talk page 
You recently made a comment on Sarah777's talkpage which was quite strong in content. If this comment was not being addressed to Sarah, but to the IP contributor who preceeded you on the page, then it should have been made on the IP's talkpage. You should only address Sarah on Sarah's page. If, OTOH, you were addressing your remarks to sarah then you were way out of line. Either way I think you owe Sarah an apology. I also thing you should revert your edit and place it on the IPs talk page.   

It is quite obvious that i'm addressing it to the IP as Sarah never made a threat. It is hardly way out of line seeing as the IP was making what could be easily regarded as combative threat. Also its a talk page, but if you insist i shall remove the message to their talk page. An apology? I remember the last time i asked you for an apology.  (talk) 

I'm actually thinking of reverting my removal of the message as the IP's address is not static and each time they appear, their IP will be different.  (talk) 
The IPs threat is as hollow as his/her head. I wouldn't pay much attention to it.   
No need to personally attack them with the hollow comment. A threat by an Irishman (republican or loyalist) should never be taken as hollow lol.  (talk) 

I never made a threat , mabuska , so stop crying . GoodDay , my head is far from hollow, I have a static IP ,so how do I do it? please explain and personal remarks are not allowed please apologise .Back to mabuska. Never met a loyalist who is Irish , not once , did you ? """"could be easily regarded as combative threat."""" If I did make a threat you would have no problems reading it , even as like myself english is not your first tongue . Now there are going to be some issues over how I do bussiness on here , I understand that , and I DO NOT apologise for them .Now any questions? This is going to be fun .  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 109.78.243.56   

If you want to be a disruptive, arguementative, combative editor, go ahead. Such editors usually end up being indefinately blocked. Actually the vast majority of broadband IP's are never static as far as i'm as i'm aware, so unless you create an actual account to edit with, you will end up with a different IP every different day or week you appear unless it cycles back to one you've already used.

Anyways who said i was a loyalist? Never said i was and will state quite clearly for you that i am not one. If i was i'd had no shame in declaring that i am.

You show your own lack of knowledge of Irish history anyways. What was James Craig, someone you can call a loyalist, described as at his funeral? As a proud Ulsterman and Irishman. Edward Carson himself was a proud Irishman but can also be easily classified as a loyalist. They always said the Troubles was mostly due to ignorance and prejudice - especially towards history. 

If you really want to make a difference on Wikipedia and be somewhat successful at doing so the best way is to play by Wikipedias rules and not by being disruptive or coming out with childish remarks such as """"stop crying"""" or implying threats.  (talk) 

Never called you a loyalist -where did you get that from I dont makes assumptions , asked you a question , you failed to answer - the men you mention are no longer and by definition you could not meet them Ireland is a sovereign state and that was my point even the loyalist I know are not Irish citizens which is what Irish is defined as , never implied a threat stop crying lol , Wikipedia has to obey wider rules than its own , I have no lack of knowledge , how do editors get block by not going by the rules -I havent broken any nor will I , now if you dont mind I have some work to do , now apologise to me for FALSELY saying I threatened you .""",0.0

 Why confusion and controversy in the """"real world"""" does not preclude the writing of a good Wikipedia on the topic 

Ackoz suggests that, because the real world has not yet hashed out """"the truth"""" about the expulsions, it is therefore impossible for us to know the truth and thus impossible for us to write about it.

I reject such a stance.  I think it is difficult but quite possible to write a quality Wikipedia article about a topic that is murky and/or controversial.  Where many Wikipedia editors """"get it wrong"""" is that they believe Wikipedia's job is to report the truth.  This is wrong.  Wikipedia's job is not to report the truth precisely because it is difficult to determine what the truth is.  Any attempt to do that is original research.

Instead of """"truth"""", Wikipedia aims for """"verifiability"""".  Put a different way, Wikipedia is committed to recording the state of human knowledge and opinion (not our opinions but those of reliable sources).  If the truth is clear and uncontroversial, it is easy for us to report that.  If the truth is murky and controversial, it is more challenging but possible for us to report on what different reliable sources assert and think about a topic EVEN if these reliable sources conflict.  Where Wikipedia editors get into trouble is when they start siding with one side of a controversy and asserting that the side that they have selected represents """"THE TRUTH"""" and not just one perspective (or POV) on the topic at hand.

I have been trying to hit this NPOV """"sweet spot"""" but it is difficult to do so in the midst of a running polemical debate between the two sides.

 
Obviously is, because some users (Jadger and Wikiferdi) don't want to discuss in fact, they want us to agree with their POV, that's not discussion about the NPOV edits. That's why I quit from the discussion about the form of the article. ≈talk≈ """,0.0

As a respected contributor to the above article, you're probably best placed to deal with the issues with it.

 BCN-SIA discussion 

First, sorry because my poor english.

Hi, i don't want to start a undo-war or something like that, but the avionews post is only a rumour. It's a propaganda speech from a Milan SEA not a declaration of any SIA officer.

I've talked with the SIA spanish comercial manager and he says me that the italian SIA officers inmediatly deny that issue, nor the SIA-BCN cancellation, nor the FCO-MXP flights traspassing... and all is a simply propaganda from Milan in this moments of crisis. This was also confirmed by SIA London regional headquarters...

Unfortunately, I haven't found any italy/UK SIA press relase dennying the Milan SEA president affirmations but i think that informations that I have are enough to question the avionews article.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

Because of that, I have """"twicked"""" the comment from """"until summer 2009"""" to """"probably until summer 2009, in which they could codeshare with other Star Alliance partners""""
In the article, the text refered (Today the SiA flights carry out the Singapore-Malpensa-Barcelona route but in short time the flight will be reduced to Singapore-Malpensa route, while the continuation to Barcelona will be assured by Lufthansa Italia), is not referenced as Bonomi's words but as an explanation by Avionews.
The comments is not anymore an affirmation but a puntuation between brackets. Sincerely, I fail to see your urge to remove it. Cheers. MauritiusXXVII (Aut Disce, Aut Doce, Aut Discede!).

Thanks for getting back to me. I share your """"opinion that we should point out clearly and repeatedly that both Republicans and Democrats are clearly to the right of the demographic center,"""" and I agree it seems like a minority opinion in the mass media. But I still view it as a neutral opinion. With this view, the idea that """"the Democratic Party is almost evenly divided between left-of-center liberals and more centrist moderates"""" seems irrelevant in the lead of an American Left article. I thought that text written in the prefaces to the Encyclopedia of the American Left might hold sway over other editors by serving to dispel disagreements about the scope, lead, and the most important subdivisions of topic. That might be the case in German Wikipedia, and I think it's the case here in science and history articles, but, in politics, perhaps no academic authority can ever hold sway over editors here. This means that even the foundational defining terminology of US politics articles like this one with a potentially ambiguous scope might never be stable. But I respond easily to baiting, I bait other editors myself, I can be sarcastic, and I'm an infrequent (but confident) contributor. If the article is improving now, then it's probably best for someone like me to just shut up.

Dear Modernist -

The society has had many a notable event prescribed to its name. For example, a student whom is now a astronaut with NASA was once a humble member - Andy Thomas that is. Several other events throughout time, such as the hanging of a car on the torrents footbridge, the disassembly and reassembly of a entire vehicle into a corridor of the third level of engineering south, the stealing and ransom of Ronald McDonald from the myer center - all were orchestrated by AUES members. The way I have explained them here makes such events seem only of interest to a quite narrow, local, audience, but when thought about, they are things which can be told in such a way that they are of interest to the greater population. Things such as the hot water system in the Crown and Anchor pub, in the city, being removed by students during one of the engie pub crawls would also be notable, in my opinion.

 Your claim of possible sockpuppetry in FPC contributions 

I justed wanted to clear something up. Yes, I know that in the Leopard Tortoise candidate voting, I said Oppose with the reasoning """"It looks like an average snapshot to me."""", and that the user Tenio also opposed with pretty much the exact same reason. I want to let you know that Tenio is not a sockpuppet of mine, and here is some information on why I said """"oppose"""". 

User:Muhammad Mahdi Karim sent me a message after seeing my vote, asking me what I meant by """"average shot"""". I wrote back with this:

""""This is what i mean by an 'average shot'. I am a photographer, and I don't really find anything in the photo that would make it anything special from many others. The use of flash rid the turtle of any contrast and washed out the colors while created dark shadows under the shell. The composition is pretty average, all I can say about it is that you centered the turtle. It looks like you just relied on the auto settings on the camera and got lucky. All in all, it's a photo anyone could have taken.""""

It's also on his talk page. I don't have any personal grudge against Muhammed Mahdi Karim and Tenino's vote and reason is only coincidence.

Also on another note, I took bit of offense at your comment in the FPC when you said """"It doesn't mean their votes don't count, just that they need to be treated with caution until they 'prove' themselves. -"""", because you are implying that my vote for some reason should carry less weight than an 'established' user's vote. I'm sorry if I haven't been editing wikipedia for too long, but I have been doing photography much longer than I have been contributing to wikipedia, and I have familiarized myself with the standards of wikipedia's Featured Pictures.

Ah, wait.  I think I see what TallMagic is talking about.  He's saying that the ODA advises site visitors that the [www.ope.ed.gov/accreditation/Search.asp Office of Postsecondary Education] of the United States Department of Education has questionable accuracy in its database of accredited U.S. colleges.  But, we are to blindly accept that an Archive.org snapshot of the Oregon ODA is infallible, even better and more perfect than a very similar database kept by the United States government.  We're to believe that it's important for Wikipedia to assert that WIU was """"operating illegally"""", even though this charge was never mentioned in any news source of any kind, even though this charge was never filed in any court in Pennsylvania or any court in any jurisdiction in the world.  And we're to take this on the word of someone who has been lambasting unaccredited institutions across the Internet for decades, who can't find a single like-minded editor other than an admin with whom he shares 90% of their joint editing activity on articles dealing with unaccredited institutions.  

The phrase """"operating illegally"""" occurs 44 times in Wikipedia article space. I count 12 of those 44 where the phrase is used to describe the phenomenon of an unaccredited educational organization.  I wonder if I searched the history of those 12 articles, would I find that either TallMagic or his partner admin Orlady have added that phrase """"operating illegally"""" to Wikipedia, and whether the source will be cited, and if so, will it be a mainstream media report that asserts the importance, or whether it will be an Archive.org snapshot of this purportedly infallible Oregon state website?

Hi Darius, a part of the reason I think the genocide looms so large, and deserves space in a 3 paragraph summary is because it is still a """"big deal"""" and current event topic.  There are laws being drafted in Turkey restricting freedom of speech on this issue even as they try to join the E.U.  Major motion pictures like Ararat which cover the genocide cannot be shown in Turkey, sometimes due to the government, sometimes due to terrorist threats.  So perhaps when there is an admission, and the topic fades out, the time will have come to relegate this solely to the history pages.

Meanwhile, no two genocides are alike, but the Armenian/Jewish ones have a great deal in common.  The scale of both surpassed a million, both ended in the murder of over half the population and expulsion of the rest, both were done under cover of world war, both had nationalistic and religious overtones, while targetting a minority known for industriousness and wealth, and the similiarities go on.  The """"neutrality"""" of information has only been an issue because unlike post-war Germany, which was thoroughly defeated, Turkey, which had signed a treaty of Sevres which stipulated an independent Armenia who's borders were drawn by President Wilson of the USA instead had an internal revolution, changing all their treaties so as not to even mention Armenia ONCE, and then began a massive government campaign to rewrite history.

 To attempt to briefly several of Ed's questions from what I can only hope is an Eastern Orthodox Christian POV:
 * Nothing """"compels"""" a just God to """"enforce"""" a person's separation from Him, save the principle of the person's free will. If a person chooses not to love God, or chooses a life separate from God, that amounts to the same as choosing death, since they are cutting themselves off from the ultimate source of life. Looking at the word """"perish"""" in John 3:16, in Greek it is in neither active nor passive voice, but rather """"middle voice"""", which means a better translation would be """"whoever does not believe in him will destroy himself"""". Living in the presence of an all-loving God while rejecting that love is how some Orthodox theologians describe Hell; hence, God's love is sometimes described as a """"river of fire"""". Hence both God's goodness and justice are preserved, as well as each person's free will.
 * Also, Jesus did not have to die. To say that he was forced to die would imply that some external force or law is greater than God and forced God to act against His will. Eastern Orthodoxy has always rejected this notion, and rather says that Jesus chose to lay down his life in order trample down death by death. When Death tried to swallow up the the Giver of Life, Death's power was overcome. As for alternative plans, none are discussed, but that's not the same as saying that God had no choice or was compelled by something or someone else. Some Church Fathers speak of Christ triumphantly mounting the Cross like a steed.
 * The Jews did not have to accept Jesus as their Messiah. He simply was their Messiah; it was not an elected office, and their choices did not change this fact, did not prevent his triumphant death or his resurrection. Many Jews did believe in him, many more did not.
 Hope this helps. I'll have to look another time at whether or how any of this should affect the article, as I'm obviously coming in very late to an old discussion.  17:15 Sep 9, 2002 (UTC)""",0.0

I feel I should offer my side of this story, since I don't react kindly to accusations of racism. I stumbled across this article whilst browsing the Recent Changes list, hence the speed of my revert. I noted that substantial, unsourced and potentially COI text had been added, constituting a major alteration to the bias of the page, and deleted it per WP:NPOV. Without sources, such information is flagrant POV-pushing - had sources been cited, I would have been perfectly happy to let it stand.

I knew nothing of the Cassez case before arriving at this article, and acted purely in line with Wikipedia policy. Cassez's guilt or innocence is of no concern to me, or to Wikipedia; what does concern me is the addition of non-neutral text without adequate - or indeed, any - citations.

CONCLUSIONS 

Fibromyalgia is a clinical syndrome... Medicines that affect pain perception, sleep, and mood have been useful and should be integrated with activity, exercise, and educational programs. Most patients with FM observed in tertiary referral centers report little change in their symptoms over time. The outcome is directly related to psychosocial factors, including past and current psychological distress and work status or disability issues. As with any chronic illness, patients in the community do better than those observed in specialty clinics. Ten percent to 30% of patients describe being work impaired from FM. Physicians should discourage inactivity and disability because, if these are prolonged, there is an adverse effect on prognosis. Finally, patients have found a diagnostic label to be reassuring, and the diagnosis has decreased costly testing and health care use. ...

Dbachmann, I am not in the least surprised by your civil and composed response.  Maybe Decius' English is no better than his Ancient Greek.

If Decius wishes to, he can start by offering apologies for calling me all these horrible insults, and most especially the """"weasel"""" part, which came even after his olive branch (the hypocrisy of it!).

 General editing practice - not about eu-FEDS 

I know I just said """"keep it on the article talk page"""", but I'm going to respond here separately on a couple of things that don't bear directly on that article, to avoid cluttering up that space with things that aren't useful to other editors.

Have you in fact read the Wikipedia guidelines? I'm not trying to be snarky; it's an honest question, because you seem to have a few misunderstandings about the process here.

First, if you feel that anything in an article is inappropriate, whether it's the original text or a recent change, you can edit it. You don't have to ask me to """"reverse the changes"""". There are still rules of editing etiquette that apply, such as not just ping-ponging changes back and forth (see WP:3RR), and being willing to discuss differences of opinion on talk pages like this. But no one owns the article - not me, not you; no one has veto power, except for administrators; and there's no reason to ask anyone in particular to make changes for you. It's not as if I wiped out your text forever: it's all in the article history, which is pretty easy to use.

Second, WP articles are not to be written based on what you or anyone else may think are """"very logical reasons"""" to support a theory. It is fine to explain a particular person's or group's point of view on the subject, pro or con, as long as it's attributed clearly; but the encyclopedia itself is not in the business of saying what makes sense, and the purpose of the talk pages is not to argue about whether a theory is correct. Debates that might be very productive in the pages of a scientific journal are less so in an encyclopedia. This is particularly important when the theory has not yet reached wide acceptance as a scientific consensus - and I don't think you're claiming that it has. That is why I don't think the link from, for instance, SIV was appropriate; by stating that argument in the voice of the encyclopedia itself, it made it sound as if most researchers agree that this is a likely explanation. Again, see Wikipedia:Neutral point of view - one of the absolutely crucial WP rules.

Third, on a more trivial note, it is basic WP etiquette to log in under your username before you make edits or comments (so people can see who is doing what); to use the standard """"~~~~"""" signature for your comments; and, when responding to a specific paragraph on a talk page, to indent your response immediately below it with """":"""" rather than copying and pasting the previous comment elsewhere.""",0.0

 Jorge Gracie 
The article was deleted via a 3-2 vote.  This isn't a consensus but rather a small majority. I have seen quite often when a 3-2 vote did not result in deletion but the talk of no consensus reached.   Additionally, many individuals in the articles for deletion noted Jorge via MMAnote rather than MAnote .   At worst, I would like to have this article userfied.  Thank you.    
Rough Consensus on wikipedia is about balancing arguments against consensus not policy. So on one hand we had keep votes arguing against an inherent notability that didn't have a policy background and a delete side that was arguing that the subject did not meet the GNG/inclusion guideline because the sources were inadequate. The sources brought up in the discussion did not seem to meet the GNG so I was left with policy based arguments to delete and non-policy based arguments to keep. That gives a rough consensus to delete. I'm always happy to userfy. Where would you like it.  Humbug! 
Fully disclosing my biases toward keep on this issue, I agree with  that you made an erroneous decision on this one. I'm no admin, but the debate appears fully in the midst of no consensus, which as you well know, in deletion discussions, normally results in the article, page, image, or other content being kept. I find it confusing that you would say that the keep votes didn't have a specific policy foundation in mind when I specifically and intentionally addressed WP:BASIC as the guildeline (particularly because this was a bio) and then listed a recently published book, black belt magazine, and (least but not irreverently so) the BJJ heroes biography as sources which achieve this guideline. If, for whatever reason, you find the more prime WP:GNG to be the true standard of retention for this article, well I see no reason why it does not equivalently square with nor meet the standards set forth in WP:BASIC. I say this in due respect sir.   
I'm a bit confused BASIC is a simplification of the GNG, Please can you explain which sources are suitable to determine notability in this case? Thanks,.   Humbug! 
Good sir, I'm a bit flummoxed as to what it is about the glut of sources that ISN'T particularly suitable for you. Is it the """"Significant coverage"""" or some other such sub-section of the GNG specifically? I believe that this source would have more than met that. I mention WP:BASIC specifically because this is (was) a biography and BASIC pertain to biographies specifically. Most critically is the section: """"If the depth of coverage in any given source is not substantial (as many of these sources admittedly were not), then multiple independent sources may be combined to demonstrate notability, which the at least dozen or so sources DID in a non-trivial manner. Now I know I'm not a administrator, and I don't have the permissions nor presumably knowledge to adjudicate these affairs, but I do casually work on more than enough bios to know that when the majority of all biographies (take this as an example) are FAR less cited and left kept or otherwise unmolested clearly there is a double standard in effect here.   
I have reviewed the sources. Have you read the guideline on reliable sourcing The only reliable source in the deleted article was the book reference and that was roughly 100 words. That and fan sites does not a wikipedia biography make. Also see Other stuff exists.  Humbug! 
You can userfy it over here.  I will update it and improve it. Buddy23Lee you can perform fixes to it as well.  Make it a complete article. https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:CrazyAces489/jorgegracie

 Nude beach & controversy 

In using the terms I have used in writing and revising this part of this article, I have sought to improve the article for the widest reading audience. I do believe the words I chose when writing this part do serve that end better than some of the changes another keeps making. All opinions are of equal value in Wikipedia, including this part of the article about a legal controversy, even if I feel that I bring to the table both an English degree and a Juris Doctor.

I have learned in my experience that some legal terms (e.g., """"upheld"""" being misunderstood understood to mean """"held up,” rather than being more correctly understood  as an action more akin to """"approving"""" a lower court’s decision) can be confusing to all levels of readers,  intelligent well-educated  readers and average readers alike. Yet, on the other hand, one does not want to completely avoid the use the accurate legal terms for those readers who understand and appreciate their use.
  
This is why I have used parentheses and the like to clarify or expand upon some terms.""",0.0

As to why Empire is so different than his other work - probably because it's based on a an upcoming video game, thus wasn't entirely his own creation.  ( talk ¿ listen ) 
Hm, it never would have occurred to me that your name was divisive.  My instinct would be to totally not worry about it unless someone says something, and probably not even then P I mean, it's great to not want to upset people, but at some point stuff is people's own problem, don't you think? Of course, this thinking is coming from a person whose userpage is a giant rainbow, so do with it what you want. P  You could always put a disclaimer on your user page or something if you're worried about it though.  Anyway, yeah, I'm desperately hoping Empire was ghostwritten or something.  Still, it wouldn't be enough of an excuse, because he still allowed his name to be put on it...  P delldot on a public computer talk

"""

 You're a liar! You have been lying all along including today, and right here above! Gurubrahma, please see the following examples of lies from just today, and here I'll quote what I wrote to him earlier: 

 Kindly please stop lying if you wish me to stop pointing out your lies. It's very rude and disrespectful when I spend my time citing verifiable and reliable sources and you just lie outright, nevermind content, but even on just simply what's happening here, and here's an example of just how you just now did it before requesting that I stop calling you """"liars""""; from Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8, I quote your statement and my reply to it:

 QUOTED: """"I hope that now since all editors have reached a consensus on the article, and have tried to explain you in clearest possible words the difference between numeral symbols and numeral system, you would play a more constructive role. Thanks.   

 QUOTED: Why are you lying again here? yes, lying! As you had been doing for quite some time now and as I have pointed out. The dictionary defines a lie as """"1. A false statement deliberately presented as being true; a falsehood. 2. Something meant to deceive or give a wrong impression."""" First of all, """"all editors have reached a consensus on the article"""" is a demonstrable false statement that you should know is not true and that we're having this exchange here is evidence enough that it isn't, nevermind others. Second, here's your other BIG lie, you say others """"have tried to explain you in clearest possible words the difference between numeral symbols and numeral system"""", Oh really? why don't you tell everyone here that it is I who made the clearest distinction and as far as I remember and see on the page I was the first to make it between numeral symbols and numeral system, and you should know because you have been around. I clearly distinguished in my first post between the Arabic Numerals (1, 2, 3, 4...) and the Hindu-Arabic Numeral system in a paraphragh that begins with """"- For a start,"""" Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#RFC_2 and you should especially know, not just because youhave been around, but also because what you quoted above happens to be just the paragraph under it!  And again I made the distinction in """"the clearest possible words"""" when I proposed here, as my first(!) point in an suggested outline,  Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#Suggested_outline.2C_please_consider_and_discuss """"differentiate a specific numeral script (eg, Arabic Western, Arabic Eastern, Devanagari) from the numeral system (ie, Indian-Arabic, which includes many numerals scripts), the rest of the article should maintain this, it should also keep in mind what the readers may have searched for when looking up this article and cater for those needs (eg, is the reader looking up the Arabic Western numerals script or the Indian-Arabic Numeral system?)"""", and then again zocky, who prefers my version and is against yours, made the same disctinction Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#What_this_page_is_about. The dictionary defines a liar as """"One that tells lies"""" and """"a person who has lied or who lies repeatedly"""", if you want me to stop calling pointing out your lies stop lying! csssclll ()""""

 In addition, I did *not* start the POV fork (Alternative views on Arabic numerals). 

 In addition, you are being misleading and also lying about the following """"I replied to his comment at Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8, and at 22:08, asked him on Talk:Arabic numerals to respond to my comment at Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8. At 22:09 he said he had already replied on that page. I replied at 22:10 saying he hasn't. At 23:38 he posted a reply on Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8, and then posted a message on Talk:Arabic numerals claiming that I was blatantly """"lying"""" at 22:10 when I said he had'nt replied. Obviously, anyone who would look at the timings will take a second to figure out the truth.""""... Why do you not mention that you replied to someone else on Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8 at """"deeptrivia (talk) """", which I later on found and I replied to you at """"csssclll()"""", which you should be aware of because you replied at """"Thanks. deeptrivia (talk) """" but you don't mention this above!! ~Why don't you mention it?!

I did accidentally miss some text from my post and have now corrected it. I did not intend to say you were a BNP supporter. I noticed that you had edited the British National Party article recently and that was what I said, and which I stand by. I did not even look at your edit and even if I had I could not conclude or intend to say that you are a supporter of the BNP. If it was possible to read it that way, then I apologise. I have edited the remarks to make it make sense (I see now that it was incomplete). 
It is true that you and Steven Slater have edited the article about the BNP which is a tiny and insignificant extremist party in the UK. I did find it strange that two people who edit that article should descend and comment on the NPOV issue raised by Jesanj; especially when Jesanj has also mentioned in the past a claim that I did not understand at all until I googled the matter and it led me to a LaRouche organization website. I have no idea if he did get that comment from Larouche or invented it himself independently but this has aroused suspicion because the LaRouche organization seems to me to be an extreme political organization not at all unlike the BNP. There is also another connection I have found between Jesanj's edits and the LaRouche organization which for the time being I will not reveal publicly. Furthermore, an editor who was found to be a sock of a known LaRouche editor and who was apparently editing from a Larouche IP address was actively involved in supporting Jesanj in another edit dispute I have had with Jesanj. That user has now been blocked from editing WP. Here we have an editor (Jesanj) trying to justify that Palin was talking about NICE when there is no evidence for that. And now at NPONV we have a group of editors with editing connections to matters of extreme right wing / Nazi like organizations all seem to wish to see preserved in WP the same thing. An association, no matter how remote and unlikely between NICE and Death Panels. Jesanj also wants to connect NICE and the IPAB! Both are non mainstream (or extremist) views, which is why I keep removing his multiple attempts to add POV bias to WP. The combination of factors i describe is, I believe, a prima facia case for believing that there may not be any independence in the views being expressed by SOME of the editors who have commented on the NPOV issue. The simple fact is that Palin did not refer to NICE as a death panel and as far as we know, she did not even wish to imply that. She has had plenty of opportunity to clarify her comments and not once has she mentioned NICE. The position of the UK journalists is absurd because it has no foundation and as far as anyone can tell, so only an extremist would wish to support that view. To repeat it twice in different places when there is already a reference to NICE as a potential """"death panel"""" candidate in the article is taking liberties, and up with this we should not put. Which is why I deleted two of the references and left the third in.    """,0.0

 UNBLOCK ME YOU ASSHOES! 

{{unblock|HAHAHAHA!!!

One of my favorite and most vivid memories was of a party I attended in high school. It was near the end of the year, and everyone was letting loose. The party had not gotten too badly out of control, and was finally winding down.

I was dating Karen at the time. We'd been going out for about six months. We knew our time together was growing short since we'd soon be heading off to college, she to Radcliffe, and I to Johns Hopkins. We were taking every chance we could to be intimate. I'd been with a few girls before, but Karen had been my first long term intimate relationship, and we'd taught each other lots.

The party was at Keith's house and we were helping him clean up. There were only six of us left, Karen and I, Keith, his girlfriend Linda, Tom and his girlfriend Sue. Linda lived just a few doors down and had invited Karen and Sue to spend the night. Tom was going to spend the night at Keith's house. Conveniently, Linda's parents were out of town until tomorrow noon, so nobody really had anywhere they had to go, and once we'd done a fair job of cleaning up we are able to sit back and relax.

Keith was my best friend. We had a lot in common, even if we were a bit of a """"Mutt and Jeff"""" in appearance. Both of us tall, I had a wide body, result of my Hawaiian ancestry, while he was lean and blonde. I'm 6'1"""" but he had a good 2 inches on me, and had long hair past his shoulders. Mine is brown and curly, and usually just goes whereever it wants. I'm strong as an ox, he's lean and fast. But we had similar taste in women. On more than one occasion I teased him that there was no way he deserved to be with Linda, our high-school goddess, and he was extremely envious that I had Karen, our big-breasted sexy bombshell, as my partner.

Karen and Sue were close friends. If we'd had Diana here, the triumvirate would have been complete. They had all been innocents until that year. Diana was dating, and Karen told me that she and Ryan were 'almost there', doing everything except the final act. Karen hadn't done much of anything until we'd gotten together. But we didn't let grass grow under us, and we made up for a lot of lost time. We'd had sex plenty, and she'd sucked me off more times than I can count. I'd even fucked her incredible tits a couple of times. Sue, it turns out, was the late bloomer. She was still an innocent according to Karen. Kissing was as far as she'd gone, although it seems she'd rubbed Tom's dick through his pants, and he'd had his hands on her mound, even if the underwear was still in the way. But Karen was hinting that this party might be Tom's lucky night.

We were joking about some of the antics that had been going on at the party. Linda in particular was a lurker; she'd sit back and watch all the activities at the party and was always good for a few laughs.

""""There were some really desperate people here tonight,"""" she said. """"Can you believe Gary tried to get a game of Spin the Bottle going?""""

""""I can't say I really blame him,"""" I answered with a grin. """"Not every guy there is as fortunate as us to have such gorgeous girlfriends, or any girlfriend for that matter. Hell, I wouldn'd mind playing it now!"""" That earned me a poke in the ribs from Karen.

Sue chimed in, """"Why is it that every party ends up with some lame guy trying to start some stupid game like Spin the Bottle, Post Office, or Strip Poker?""""

""""Now that's a stupid question,"""" Keith answered.

""""And why is that?"""" Linda asked, pointedly.

""""Isn't it obvious?"""" Keith replied.

""""No."""" Linda and Sue answered in unison.

""""Do you want to tell them?"""" Keith asked me with a nod.

So I explained the obvious. """"Because they ARE desperate - and sometimes it works.""""

""""Oh please!"""" Karen said.

Keith was a real instigator. """"You guys have never played Spin the Bottle?""""

The girls looked at each other. """"Maybe a few times, but certainly not in the last year."""" Linda finally answered.

""""And how about Truth or Dare?"""" Keith continued egging them on.

""""Well sure, but usually only with people we know really well,"""" Karen answered this time.

""""Usually."""" Keith echoed with a grin. """"And it's not like you've never played Strip Poker.""""

The girls looked at each other quietly no one answering.

""""Oh come on,"""" I teased, """"Karen I know you've played Strip Poker.""""

""""Not really. I watched part of a game, but then they chased everyone not playing out of the room. Why? I suppose you've played it?"""" She asked with a dangerous tone in her voice.

""""Sort of. In camp we started a game but it got raided before we got anywhere."""" I confessed, drawing a laugh from the guys. """"L",0.42857142857142855

Tila Nguyen
Hello,

I see you've deleted Tila Nguyen from Category:Porn stars and List of heterosexual erotic actresses.  I know Tila does mostly softcore work, but if you search around you will see she appears in films caressing other women in the nude and in a very explicitly sexual manner that is intended to arouse the viewer.  I think she at least qualifies as an erotic actress, even if not completely a porn star.   04:22, 20 Sep 2004 (UTC)

 Cuyamaca 

I noticed that you added the merge tag to Cuyamaca and Cuyamaca, California. I originally created a single article but it seemed to me that towns and villages tend to have dedicated articles so I split the article in two. I'm inclined to agree that a single article would be sufficient. Is this consistent with other articles that cover a city, town or village and the like-named region in which they sit? If so, in your opinion, should the articles be consolidated under """"Cuyamaca"""" or """"Cuyamaca, California""""?  17:58, 27 Sep 2004 (UTC)

I couldn't find enough information about the village to expand it so I merged Cuyamaca with Cuyamaca, California and marked Cuyamaca for deletion. I assume that all the other particulars, such as the duplicate article page, will be taken care of.  00:51, 28 Sep 2004 (UTC)

 Northern vs. Southern California speech 

In response to your question on the Regional American English talk page, I think it would be fascinating to see a section on differences between Northern and Southern California speech, especially since both regions seem to have distinct characters.

Thanks, Umeboshi! Yes, it has surprised me how quick on the draw (and vituperative) some folks have been in expunging any reference to the alleged/purported/apparent Israeli espionage. As happens in other contexts, I think some people conflate criticism of Israel with anti-semitism  or conflate this intentionally. The ironic thing is that if all this stuff is true (as seems at least worth serious consideration), it even reflects well on Israel, as there is evidence Israel warned the US that something big was coming.

You say """"I would suggest Hibernian that you or someone make a file of the Wilton Ivey piece, and use that in reference to Urban Planning."""", but that is essentially what is already there, the Urbanates article was mostly written in reference to the ideas Wilton Ivey, etc. If you want a longer section about what a Technate might do with cities before it replaces them with Urbanates (which would likely take decades to build), then be my guest if you know some specifics about it.

Add a couple of sentences, either in the lead or in the historiography section, explaining why this division is somewhat problematic. (Mind, any division that gets established is problematic, for the same reasons)

Le Grand, you are not innnocent. So why do you continue to act like the victim here? You twisted many of the things around on me. I talked with Ran on his talk page about you, that's the only case you are right about. The other cases you assume (collectarian and Judgesurreal's talk pages): I didn't mention your name once.

It was found that McJeff was a part of the problem. Remember: it takes two to have a conflict, and the evidence I provided at the RFC shows McJeff isn't innocent either. If he ignored more things, it would be a different story. But for the most part: McJeff harassed me, and egged me on to get a reaction out of me. Also, Le Grand's repost of ANI comments here isn't productive in my view. People can see the ANI post clearly, so there's no need to be redundant.   """,0.0

"""

I think the intitial problem here is a WIkiepdia-old ownership issue - the very language Parrot of Doom uses gives this away. Although I agreed with his revert in this case (there are better ways present the fact of Griffin's well known bigotry than just to define him a 'bigot'), when I read his """"biased garbage"""" edit note I was appalled at both the rudeness and politics, and planned to warn him myself tonight. As with myself, Nfitz is an experienced editor (from 2005 in his case, 2006 in mine). Also, I am VERY worried about Parrot's real stance on far right issues, despite what he says about Griffin on his user page. It’s an unfortunate truth that many people who so foolishly support the BNP just want certain policies and issues to made more public, and are not at all Griffin fans. I hope people can digest that comment. The BNP are also very, very clever, and without question far right – so I think we are all entitled to be wary of them from a Human Rights stance, whatever some people might insist about dotting each ‘i’ of the WP:AGF policy. Parrot has reacted to edits in this manner before, and if he (or anyone else) does it again I won't hesitate to make an official complaint, both on the rudeness and bias in the content.

No matter what friends you make on Wikpedia, people like Slim Virgin (and others complementary of the trimming of likely problems from the Griffin article in time for Question Time) won't be stupid enough to defend totally uncalled-for civility indiscretions to time-served editors who are CLEARLY acting in good faith. Especially given the dangerous politics involved from one side only here, and considering what should be expected to happen from the middle ground with this article being so plainly lily-livered - about a terrifying political disease that so nearly destroyed Europe. They won't be so keen to line up, and will answer to people like me if they are too hasty. And Jews perhaps, Muslims, blacks - people like that? I'm still reeling from the 'mainstream' introduction I saw here last Thursday. I insist the BNP could not have come up with a better article themselves, as any showing less of their true values would hardly pass. The article had 100,000 hits (obviously - how can we be surprised about that?) and single-handedly proved right the nationally-made argument on why Griffin should not have been invited to the TV show: the irresponsible media (mainly Wikipedia, alas) will be able to casually present Griffin as a standard mainstream politician. And all in the name of supposed damage-limitation to Wikipedia's own credibility. 

Parrot please - take a step back from the 'tired owner' stance, or you yourself will cause the kind of editing problems you claim you've been striving to avoid.

One day on this encyclopeda the reader will come first. Any argument that says prospective far right voters (if I'm actually allowed to use that term 'far right'?) can cleverly ‘read between lines’ - or even bother to read to the end of articles - is simply fully naive. Besides, the introduction is king with the reader, as it summerises what is below it. The majority of BNP supporters are THE most vulnerable people in Britain – and often the least educated. Wikipedia consistently ignores both the reader and the subject in its self-providing calculations, and with this deliberately damage-limited article (to put it most politely), it has manifestly helped to ‘rubber stamp’ fascism in the UK. A lot of people (esp non-Europeans) won’t know what that means, but many of us would agree that Wikipedia can scarcely have had a lower day.   """,0.0

 The McIntosh et al. 2013 study on rotational acceleration and bicycle helmets 

I have restored the reference to this study in the """"Rotational Injury"""" section of the article - someone had removed it and substituted a reference to a another study by McIntosh et al. which deals only with motorcycle helmets. Unfortunately, it seems the publisher has made a mistake and the McIntosh et al. paper and one other paper are missing from the online journal contents (you can see the gap in the page numbers for that issue). The corresponding author is endeavouring to have that corrected, but the paper does exist, I have seen a copy of it. It isn't indexed in PubMed yet either.  In the meantime, I will post of a copy of the abstract from the paper here:
ANDREW S. MCINTOSH, ADRIAN LAI and EDGAR SCHILTER. Bicycle Helmets: Head Impact Dynamics in Helmeted and Unhelmeted Oblique Impact Tests. Traffic Injury Prevention (2013) 14, 501–508. online DOI: 10.1080/15389588.2012.727217. 
Objective: To assess the factors, including helmet use, that contribute to head linear and angular acceleration in bicycle crash simulation tests.
Method: A series of laboratory tests was undertaken using an oblique impact rig. The impact rig included a drop assembly with a Hybrid III head and neck. The head struck a horizontally moving striker plate. Head linear and angular acceleration and striker plate force were measured. The Head Injury Criterion was derived. The following test parameters were varied: drop height to a maximum of 1.5 m, horizontal speed to a maximum of 25 km/h, helmet/no helmet, impact orientation/location, and restraint adjustment. Additional radial impacts were conducted on the same helmet models for comparison purposes. Descriptive statistics were derived and multiple regression was applied to examine the role of each parameter. 
Results: Helmet use was the most significant factor in reducing the magnitude of all outcome variables. Linear acceleration and the Head Injury Criterion were influenced by the drop height, whereas angular acceleration tended to be influenced by the horizontal speed and impact orientation/location. The restraint adjustment influenced the outcome variables, with lower coefficients of variation observed with the tight restraint. 
Conclusions: The study reinforces the benefits of wearing a bicycle helmet in a crash. The study also demonstrates that helmets do not increase angular head acceleration. The study assists in establishing the need for an agreed-upon international oblique helmet test as well as the boundary conditions for oblique helmet testing.

Hi Shimeru,

I must say I've been thoroughly surprised of your block on me. I admit freely that my comments were quite over the top, but despite your rationale I've seen no previous warning (nor has the unblocking admin), while instead you took care of warning TreasuryTag for example. Also, I see much worse violations of WP:CIVIL and WP:NPA everyday that even when protested at AN/I or WQA for admin attention do not lead to blocks. I also explicitly stated that no personal attack was meant at all and that mine was (harsh, agree) criticism of opinions.

 8/26 and  26/08  or  runway  8  and runway 26

Should the multi runways be parallel  the modifying letters  """"R"""" and """"L""""  will be added to corresponding runway numbers.

DO  NOT  correect  what you are alleging REDUNDANT numbers if you do not understand AIRPORT safety operation.

Altough the AIRPORT has only two (2) runways in reality  from the operational point there are 4 runways  depending on weather (wind) conditions.

The runways therefore are for runway  8/26 there are two (2) runways  one knowm as 8 and other  as 26
for runway  4/22 there are  two (2) runways  one runway 4 and one 22.

For people in AIRPORT operations that is a clear and only numbering system, for laiks it doesn't  mean a crap!

The translation is still widely read today, and highly regarded among many Christian groups. Some groups (known collectively as the King-James-Only Movement) even go as far as to reject all modern translations, believing the KJV to be the only reliable English Bible translation.

Yes, you have time to edit-war and restore the article to promotional version but not to edit to correct it. When corrected by some other editor, you claim it not to be perfect and do revert repeatedly. I see no good in promotional and unsourced tone and contents based purely on primary source.

Edit-warring? Did I make any edit without leaving an edit summary? It is you, despite discussing the concerns on here, you went on to make revert multiple times. I'm very much disappointed to see apparently an established editor behaving, yes, much likely to a WP:NOTHERE editor. It is you, who chooses to revert instead discussing the changes. You came here to leave a comment only after making a revert. Did you notice it? You choose to post a warning template on my talk page, instead initiating a discussion on article's talk page. You should post a edit-warring template yourself on your talk page, being honest seeing the page history. And, If I really am edit-warring, then I dare you to make a case at ANEW/ANI. 

You did not answer one previous question. Have you some 'conflict of interest' with the subject? And, the headline of the discussion is very much appropriate. You see good in 'promotional contents either unsourced or dependent of primary sources', and claim it to be encyclopedic. Is it really what you understand of encyclopedic contents? In my edit, the article has less contents, but at least it is encyclopedic, what Wikipedia is all about (see, WP:ENC). I do not care for contents, I care of standard.

Name
""""Hyacinth,"""" customarily an English woman's name, is the English spelling of the generic name of the flower – which in German is spelled with a z. 

The subject was a German male. The subject's given and legal name was Hyazinth. German WP therefore uses Hyazinth. A newly published English-language history of WWII in the Baltics, Prit Buttar's detailed and thoroughly documented Between Giants: The Battle for the Baltics in World War II – published by UK-based Osprey – uses Hyazinth in every mention.  To persist in using Hyacinth for this person is an error, regardless of what past (mistaken) practice in English may have been.

"Italian Renaissance as a featured article ==

Before getting to the substance of my comment, let me just thank you for all the work you've done for Wikipedia; users like you are such an asset to the project. I do have one minor critique to make, though... I noticed that you promoted Italian Renaissance to featured status, but at the time, I had an actionable (and in my view appropriate) objection. (Candidate page, with my comments) I objected to elevation to featured status on the grounds that there are stylistic issues in the article, missing commas, etc. I went through the first half, but haven't had time to fix the second half. At any rate, you probably just didn't see my objection; I'll do more to address it myself, but the style isn't up to par for our (rightly) high standards for featured articles.  talk

Since this grotesque offense started I have probably been solely and directly responsible for 85% of the material attempted to be posted. That 85% very quickly got chopped down to 4 sentences by half a dozen censors.  I decide to WIKI whallow again when the story goes super mainstream with CNN and even includes a """"response"""" from said obvious scumbags. NATURALLY it gets zapped again in seconds by a censor and NATURALLY its another (now 7 and counting) live wire that spends every waking hour removing and contributing nothing. 

I am stating as a fact that the entire WIKI premise has evolved into a joke and a 100% waste of time. WHY SHOULD I continue to fight the vast multitude badgehuters?
There ain't a single speck of ethics in ANY of the full time WIKI retards doing censorship as a career choice, probably because children aren't mature enough to learn what they are.

Now we have the single apparent speck of grey material in the form of ;wales telling me how vulgar and ban worthy I am for getting pissed off by the ultra sickening status quo.

User:JimWae, the part your assessment relevant to my compromise version, is for the most part, incorrect, and furthermore, you have acknowledged that you do not have references that support your claims. If you looked at the references that qualified the statement regarding the """"propagating atheism,"""" you would find that it is a factual statement. And once again, this article is not about state atheism exclusively, but about the ideology of militant atheism, which was applied to some atheist states; an atheist state could exist, without promoting militant atheism. Your version of the introduction eliminates defining the ideology of militant atheism as given by several references and summarized in the Concepts section of the article; the lede should define the ideology and then talk about its Application, which parallels the structure of the article, namely the headings listed in the article's table of contents. Furthermore, contrary to your opinion, militant atheism is an integral part of Marxism-Leninism, as supported by the consequent references. For example, Faith and Order: The Reconciliation of Law and Religion, specifically states:  When discussing content, you must keep in mind WP:RS, rather than your original research. You assert that many people do not know about the Cultural Revolution and for this reason, it should be removed from the paragraph. That argument does not hold any water whatsoever, as this is an encylopædia. Moreover, removing the information on the concept of militant atheism, the Cultural Revolution, French Revolution, and political thinkers, violates WP:LEDE, which states """"The lead should be able to stand alone as a concise overview of the article."""" Your revision of the introduction fails to do this. If the term """"Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution"""" is not as common, however, I would not mind compromising and changing it to just """"Cultural Revolution."""" Rather than constructing a new version, I would consider suggesting some alterations to the compromise version I suggested which has addressed the concerns of several people here.

"Re:Mere Rubbish ==
I also think it is mere rubbish but I also think it is not completely rubbish. According to the southeast asian history, most of the ancient rulers of this region are Hindus, some rulers came from Persia (map covered Middle east, Greece, west India - Achaemenid Empire, Seleucid Empire, Parthian Empire and Sassanid Dynasty, please look at the size of the map their conquered). Kedah is a good example where the king from Persia came and eventually he built a kingdom.

In the old days, it was slavery society (no sultanate and no democracy yet), all Hindu rulers belong to higher class, common peoples and the natives belong to inferior slave class. The Hindus rulers came from India and Persia and they ruled most of the southeast asia, they called themselves high class peoples, the rest are merely slaves. Parameswara is a Hindu ruler, he is one of the descendants of the Hindu royal family that belong to higher class of Hinduism.

As for the Macedonian bloodline, this is also not completely rubbish. In the old days, the Persian empire was so big, they are so proud with king Alexander the Great. Also, they ruled some of the southeast asian lands such as the Angkor, Pasai, etc. Parameswara later married Pasai's princess and adopted Persian Shah and claimed as descendant of Alexander the Great, I don't think all this is completely rubbish.

Please, Buspar, stop trying to use IPs to hide your identity. If you continue like that, you'll be reported. I think you played enough.  

Ah, finally you use your true identity. 

Even though your usual IPs are from Pittsburg and this last one was from Duke University, I can't help but see it as highly suspicious that yet another IP comes and suddenly gets interested precisely in the 3 articles in which, just days before, you started edit warring under the guise of various anonymous IPs. 

Besides, I have already noted similarities in the behavior of this IP and yours (suddenly calling me a """"vandal"""" without any justification, arguing that this is """"important"""" while it is not...). So please, stop pretending.

If you're are accused (whether mistakenly or not) of a 3rd act of sockpuppetry, the only person to blame for this is you, and only you. You started to act under the guise of anonymous IPs, so don't complain if the other IPs that magically appear to support you (while they had never touched these articles before) are also suspected. Had you not used IP sockpuppetry twice, you wouldn't be suspected now.

You're also not in position of accusing me of anything, since the previous 2 IPs you used can unmistakenly be linked to your account. So don't draw unnecessary attention on your case. I'm not sure the admin board will be happy to see how you've already commited 2 acts of sockpuppetry that are certains. The 3rd, I admit, is debatable for technical reasons, but otherwise, given the context, it is highly unprobable that yet another anonymous IP that acts exactly like you wouldn't be you. Besides, the fact that you decided to magically intervene just after I spoke to the IP yesterday, is yet another element against you.

After all, I could also post with the IP of a UK university (while I'm in France) if I wanted. It's not rare to find this kind of IPs in proxy lists. So please stop trying to frighten me, and face the consequences of your acts. You've already used twice a form of sockpuppetry, don't try saying you're going to accuse me for stating it, it's only making me laugh.

So don't talk of """"NPA"""" and don't even try to argue that it would be an """"insult"""" to say that you would go to such length to """"pretend"""". Because you've already pretended twice before.

For the rest, I've got nothing to add besides what I've written yesterday. You made these edits under the guise of anonymous IPs only to take your revenge for our previous quarrels. I cannot see how they could be constructive in anyway. The nature itself of your edits is illegal, since you did them using a form of sockpuppetry, which is not tolerated on WP. That's why they were reverted in the first place.  And then, I cannot see what would be the use of these edits, because first they're all unsourced, and then, they have no use, no importance, no encyclopedical relevance, they were only made in a revenge attempt. And finally, please have the decency to stop talking about """"consensus"""", because first you have always ignored them (I remind you everyone was against your fansub edits, you did them nonetheless), so reading """"consensus"""" in one of your post will always make me laugh. And second, I don't think we can talk about """"consensus"""" when the the only people that support you are yourself and your own sockpuppets. 

So, just get over it. This is over. Don't try to take your revenge, it's useless, and you'll be the only one hurt in the process.  You have now commited enough policy violations, if we add sockpuppetry to your constant edit wars and disruptions of Wikipedia (and now, the fact that you try to alter and modify people's comment in your favor). In your own interest, you should stop that, because the only one who will be blocked will be you.  14:06, 27 June 2008 (UTC""",0.0

"Records of Awesome Editors Who Truly Want To Help==

As this is not a study of people's hesitancy, it is not a suitable source for claims about the reasons for people's hesitancy. It would appear to be at best a study making claims about vaccines themselves, not a study about hesitancy or about controversy. If this study is the reason for people's hesitancy, then we should be pointing to a reliable third-party source that states that it's the reason, not to the study itself. If we say people stopped going to the beach because of the film Jaws, we use as a reference the source that makes that statement, not the film itself. So no, it's not a reliable source for what you claim you want to use it for. Nat Gertler (talk) 

That has got to be the clearest explanation yet. So what you are saying is cite a source that says there is controversy over the vaccine schedule because there is a correlation with infant mortality, then cite both sources? Or should I use opinion pieces like most of the other references in the article? Even the journal of medicine piece is an opinion piece. Is this where wiki gets the facts, from opinions, then excludes peer reviewed journal articles because it is WP:OR? It is built by popular opinion of the editors, from opinion pieces, not allowing facts...if this is indeed true....though I hope notDcrsmama (talk) 
No, I'm not saying cite both sources. References are there to verify the facts that are being stated in Wikipedia's voice. If the statement being sourced is that there is a controversy due to correlation with infant mortality, then we cite a source that is discussing the controversy - there is no need to cite the study. Even if the source says that there is a controversy because of this particular study, we might mention this study in the text, but the study itself is not reference for the statement. And I am addressing the specific request for input that you made in your initial posting. If you have concerns about the other sources in the article, you may wish to raise them in a specific post about the specific concerns. Nat Gertler (talk)

Some of these uploads are music, some are comedy, some are anti BNP/EDL. None are espousing a particular movement, political group or ideology. However, due to the fact that I espouse equality and fairness & am opposed to unwarranted victimisation, oppression of minorities, hatred and ignorance it seems that certain users like to think of it as a soapbox to spew their racist, misogynistic, homophobic, xenophobic and hate-filled gibberish....the BNPers, of course, are guilty of all the aforementioned.

Apparently my decision not to allow comments that are basically spam, lazy insults, illiterate ramblings and screeching from morons who don't listen (but just use the channel as their own forum) means I am anti free speech. I don't think our ancestors fought against fascism and for the right for freedom of speech to have hate-filled knuckle draggers abuse that by screeching hate-filled drivel bereft of facts, decency or, indeed, a point.

I do actively encourage freedom of speech for all, quite often letting idiots speak makes them look far more idiotic than I ever could hope. There is a difference between debate and spamming, insulting, not listening and preaching though.

I'm happy to debate, but a debate consists of two sides discussing their views, not one shouting and refusing to listen to anyone else. It is my channel and I have the right not to allow trolls, clones, neo Nazis, racists, haters and all round ne'er do wells the right to puke bile all over it....this is not suppression of freedom of speech and if anyone cares to look back through my channel they will see I actively encourage debate, but also see how so many choose to eschew debate in favour of: 1. Attempting to belittle, hurl abuse and calling me UAF/Marxist/far left/rapist/paedophile with absolutely no basis (libelous in reality). 2. Personal insults, accusing me of being a foreigner, bringing my family into it (they love a """"mum"""" insult) and accusing me of being several users because they can't believe more than one person can disagree. 3. Misquoting, paraphrasing and cherry picking """"research"""" from questionable sources and only ever """"research"""" or accept sources that back up their own beliefs. 4. Lying, accusing me of acts I haven't done and claiming they have """"won"""" the argument when they have ignored the points I raised and just harped on and on. 5. Cloning my account on here and also using my username on far right forums. They have cloned me numerous times. 6. Waffling on about being deprived of freedom of speech (to make insults and allow no right to reply by blocking me from their channels)

Basically, these goons make up a tiny minority of incredibly arrogant, ignorant, spiteful, indecent, amoral, borderline illiterate joy sappers; BNP, EDL, neo Nazis, Islamophobes, extremists, KKK, you name it. THEY are what is wrong with the world and they are what is trying to stop us evolving; their motivation is hatred and ignorance....proven by their labelling of everyone who disagrees with them as communists, UAF, Marxists and Liberals (and more unbelievably fascists?!?) with no basis. Of course, they are just lazy epithets to group the majority into one category when their opposition is made up of a multitude of individuals from left to right, of different coloured skin and beliefs, sexualities, classes, background etc....the majority basically.

Youtube grants these guttersnipes the anonymity to parade their ignorance and disgusting ideals and appear to be a larger group than they are. They are fooling themselves though, they will always be a minority of failures who blame their own failure in life on everyone but themselves. Ironically, our ancestors who fought for every freedom they treasure now are having it spat back in their face with every ill informed, erroneous, indecent and anti educational rant these idiots post.

You told me that I shouldn't write edits about general discussion on the talk pages of articles in Wikipedia. But this time it was different. Whereas last time you were talking about the talk pages of articles, this time we are talking about the talk pages of users. Whereas article talk pages were general and public, user talk pages were personal and private. They were different and very different from each other. I thought they were personal and private. I thought they were different and very different from each other. When you said that talk pages were not for general discussion, I thought you were just talking about the talk pages of articles, not the talk pages of users. Although general discussion wasn't allowed in the talk pages of articles, which were public, I thought they would be okay in the talk pages of users, which were personal and private. I thought you would not mind me having general discussion in a personal and private part of Wikipedia, or at least not too much or as much as in a public part. That was one reason why I didn’t thought what you told me in the article talk page meant that I shouldn’t make the edits then in the talk pages of those users.

What I did in those edits was sending, telling, and giving messages and requests, not general discussion. I thought it wasn't general discussion. That was different, perhaps very different, from general discussion, or discussion of any sort. I thought it was different. Whereas discussion is two-way and consists of several people talking together, sending messages is, or can be, just one-way, involving and being done by just one person, or both. Whereas discussion needs or involves response or repliance, sending messages doesn't need or involve sending responses or replies. The user of the talk page doesn't need to write anything in response, I just wanted him to read it and do what it asked him to. The messages and requests sent were not general either. They were special and specific, sent for a special reason about a special subject in a special time and situation. Those were not general discussion also because they were done in the talk page of a user, not the talk page of an article or the Reference Desk. I thought that was a reason why they weren’t discussion. If it was done in the talk page of an article or the Reference Desk, it would probably be discussion because it was one person talking and dicussing about this to lots of other people and a group in Wikipedia and telling and encouraging them to tell and discuss about it with each other, in a public place. But it was done in the talk page of a user, it would be just sending and telling a message because it was just with one other person and telling and saying something personally and individually to him, one way, in a private place. I thought you would not mind me having general discussion in a personal and private part of Wikipedia, or at least not too much or as much as in a public part.

Although you may think what I did in the user talk pages was very bad, it's not really that bad. I thought it was not really that bad, wrong, and serious, especially if it was just done once or only very rarely. That was one reason why I did and would have done those edits on the user talk pages. I didn't really know and understand how bad you would think it would be. I didn’t think it would be really that bad. I thought it would just either result in no response from you, another warning from you, or a block that is at least not indefinite. There were actually several reasons why it's not really that bad, or at least I thought it wasn't that bad. First, it would not have actually made any real difference or bad effect to Wikipedia or its general and public contents, facts, statements, and information, etc. It wasn't damage or disruption because it was adding information, not changing or removing information. It was added in a user talk page, a place for adding messages and not for containing facts about one specific topic. Second, it was done in the personal and private part of Wikipedia. It would be just the users of the talk pages themselves who would see, read, and look at those edits, or would just need to do so, and so you don't really even need to care or mind about it, at least not too much. Third, they probably would not mind or dislike those edits onto their talk pages, or they might even be glad to see them. Fourth, even if they didn't like having those edits being on their talk pages, they could simply delete and remove it, or perhaps also make a copy of it and place it somewhere else, or simply just ignore it. Fifth, if you don't like them you could simply go to my Special:Contributions and quickly delete all of those edits. Those were several reasons why I thought they were not really that bad, wrong, and serious.

"Thank you, Thelmadatter, I understand what you mean, but my point would be that the 1649 text is the earliest ethnographic source (the author interviewed locals about the place) on hand with respect to this issue. Also, this is not a European book, per se, rather a book written by a New Spanish peninsular who had spent a lifetime in the territories writing its history (also an important source for studies of the Virgin of Guadalupe, and a significant author of mexican mestizaje). I understand that there are other versions that are not written (bernuzzi, 1981, for example, has some of these - though they are more modern textualized acquisitions), nonetheless at the time of Florencia's text he is indicating that there is something of a lack of memory. Further to this, the assertion that the cave deity was indeed Ostoc Teotl (or some version thereof) is a result of subsequent authors' use of the Florencia text (ie.

"OK. The list of Gnostic Saints comes from a book called the Blue Equinox. The formatting that I keep reverting to is from that book. See, the section is the text of the fifth collect of the Gnostic Mass, with wikilinks.

"Marie Lou's Son and possible other lost films 
      
     Marie Lou's Son was recently listed on the list as the first animated feature film over Quirino Cristiani's El Apostol. With much research online and several of my books on the film history of animation no reference has been made of it. The film, directed by a Gerard Francois Garnett from Haiti is quite mysterious. In fact I am beginning to think about its exsistence. Could it have been made up? To This point with little info on it it could be, but there is also the possibility that it was recently discovered I'm not sure at the moment but it seems likely. Other films of intrest are

 Menobot problem?? 

Are you running Menobot on #37, #6 and #16?  If so, it is not fixing the error and just marking it as done.  There might be a WPCleaner bug on #3 that causes this. Those weren't done by Menobot, but by another user running WPCleaner.  Hmmmm.   

Problems in 16 they maybe related to code update recently.    

 Thank you both for your comments. I am stopping the bot from doing this task and I am reporting this issue.   
Should be fixed for #16 with the update I made a few hours ago. If there are problems with other errors, tell me.  (Talk on frwiki) 
    Still doesn't explain why #6 and #37 were being marked as done, but not fixed.    
, could you give me examples of articles that were marked as done but not fixed for #6 and #37 ? I took a look at a few #37 that have been marked as done, and either they were really fixed by WPCleaner (like Fröken Fräken or Günther's frog (disambiguation)), were fixed by someone else (like Adolfo Fernández) or I don't understand why they were detected for #37 (like 1971–72 New York Nets season or Emergency Afghan Allies Extension Act of 2014 (H.R. 5195; 113th Congress)).  (Talk on frwiki) 
  For #37: Chris & Matt Kidd, 2014 Västmanland wildfire, Korea — Anti-Dumping Duties on Imports of Certain Paper from Indonesia and Blum & Poe
For #6: Gå & fiska!   

For #37, did you change the way it's handled by Check Wiki? As far as I can remember, #37 was only checking the first few characters of the title (it was 3 for a long time, and then was changed to 5 sometime ago). For all the examples you provided, the special character is after the fifth character, so it shouldn't have been picked up by #37.
For #6, the DEFAULTSORT that has been added by WPCleaner is """"Ga & fiska!"""", which for me is ok. Which character is considered a special one by CW ? """"&"""", """"!"""" ?
 (Talk on frwiki) 
 For #37: Yes. Now we check the entire string. We should also warn .    
 For #6: I rename """"&"""" to """"and"""" and remove """"!"""".    
 Could you give me the list of characters that CW considers as normal characters? For WPCleaner, I'm currently using the following list: ASCII letters, digits, space and a few punctuation -:,.!?'",0.0

 Understanding how Wikipedia does things 

Hello Mike, I see you have some concerns about the article. First off, I want to note that this is exactly why we always tell people don't try to write your own article on Wikipedia. I was willing to write one for you because I think you're an interesting subject, but you really need to stop trying to work on your own article. It is absolutely impossible for you to be objective about your own work, and also you keep trying to make edits which are not properly sourced. To answer a few points:

Why are the links to the National Traditional Country Music Association pages and the Library of Congress Recorded Sound Reference Center underlined in red as non-existent? These sites do exist.  They are non-existed on Wikipedia; we aren't saying they're non-existent in general, just that nobody has written an article about them here yet. The red means """"someone should write an article about them"""". Before they were blue because you were re-routing the link to go to their own homepage, but we don't allow such external links to be used in the middle of the page like that, and also because that obscures the fact that we need somebody to write those articles.
 Regarding your nickname: if you say Plantenga is wrong, I've removed the nickname. However, you cannot simply go and fill in whatever nickname you want in its place, unless you have a clearly cited source.
 You really need to read our guideline/warning WP:Autobiography to understand exactly why you shouldn't be messing with your biography. You should not be making any edits on that page except to remove blatant vandalism. Again, you are literally the last person on earth who should be editing your own biography on Wikipedia, because doing so compromises the neutrality of the project.
 Lastly, I really suggest you read WP:Verifiability, not truth. The long/short is that a given fact is only useful if it can be cited to a good source, and no matter how true a fact is, it's no good on an encyclopedia without citation. So while we of course recognize that in the larger world, accuracy is the goal, on an encyclopedia our concern is how documentable a fact is. So on a certain level, we literally don't care whether a fact in Plantenga's book or in a Washington Post article is completely accurate, we care that it's clearly documented. Whereas if you make """"corrections"""" based on your personal knowledge, that just makes the article weaker because each such edit decreases its Verifiability.

At this point, you really need to just accept that you have a biography on Wikipedia, and it's sourced to published works, and be (moderately) happy with that. Wikipedia is absolutely not here for you to """"get the rest of the story out"""", or """"build your brand"""" or whatnot, we're just here to compile and organize information that has already been published by neutral experts. So please refrain from trying to edit your own article, it always ends badly and wastes time for everyone involved to have to change things back and forth, and just trust the Wikipedia community to do our best to keep things running smoothly.

Why is it that an overwhelmingly large portion of the article is about the risks of Silicone breast implants when most implants used today are saline?  Why is there absolutely no information about why women get implants?  I would be more than happy to help expand these subjects but I believe it will be quite pointless until those with agendas have moved on, or take their discussion on the controversy of breast implants to the proper page. aktornado",0.0

"Honestly the way wiki is treating this is a JOKE

a. I could have cited NEWS SITES but since when is a news site worthy of an academic cite?

b. if the person that wanted PEER REVIEW felt like it, he would have sought it 20 years ago, HE CHOSE NOT TO DO IT, but none the less his work is known and was mentioned in many math related 'forums' and most ignored it. 

c. Only the recent 2012 open source test of the work PROVED the 30Mod algorithm is a major thing in math, again, GITHUB is a programmers resource and it was not until a computer used the actual 30Mod algorithm that it was shown to be a 'big thing' and since then some news sites have covered it, but I chose not to cite them due to IMO they are not NPOV. But none the less they covered the story.

d. The FACT is a major computer site where programmers have free reign to challenge any claims exists and for over two years not one programmer challenged the findings.

e. so what if the person that discovered it works outside of academia and has no regard for normal 'peer review' the fact is he has no peers if you ask some in academia that know of his work, and I am one of those people that know of the work and how brilliant the work is.

Now to summarize, we have a bunch of pags about primes on wiki, and even pages created after his discovery that USE his discovery (ie. the sieve of Atkin 60Mod work is his work discussed in the public forum and usenet math and physics forums is where he chose to discuss his amazing work.

So now you have 2004 sieve of Atkin using a 60Mod algorithm, guess what that was in his 1995 paper. So does wiki acknowledge that? No. And i didn't even bother to waste my time of the 60 mod algorithm since the big deal as you are saying is the PyPrimes test and I cited that very well, it's a program created in Python, I cited the wiki python page, then I cited Github for both PyPrimes and the PyPrimes testing.

Now while MATH is m forte, I am sufficient enough in computer skills to understand what Github is and to understand how to read the speed tests and the prime spirals smoked every algorithm there is. Now anyone can download python (which I have done) and download pyprimes (which I have done) and run the tests. Guess what just like a math experiment, it is duplicated.

So GITHUB and the tests which are not 'new' should be enough to begin a wiki page on this truly amazing discovery in math.

I myself became aware of the first paper in 1995, as did others in aademia. Recently I became aware of 'news sites' running stories citing what I copied, the links to the Github tests.

While some here can say well it's not AMA, so what, in the world of primality testing primes spirals as per the PyPrimes results shows PRIME SPIRALS are a big deal.

Now I tried to be NPOV in giving all sides of the story, Adoni has a valid 1995 claim I can verify it and I chose not to. But I cited a Drexel Math forum and I could have cited many other math sites discussing his 30mod, 60mod and 90mod prime work in the 1990's. Is this signficant? You bet it is since 60Mod prime sieve aka Atkin sieve is 20004 so his 60mod prime work is well before it.

Now the Github tests mentions 'croft spirals', that's due to in 2010 a person named croft registering a web site and ripping off the 1995 work. MY OPINION.

Now Croft can say all he wants that he found it playng his guitar or whatever he is claiming.

The fact is anyone can document Adoni with Prime theory from the 1990's saying 30mod, 60mod and 90mod is the key.

9 Years later sieve of atkin appears, well that's only a rehash of the adoni 60mod work from the 1990's. Yet no one is giving him credit.

2010 croft puts out his 30Mod work and its inserted into PyPrimes on Github and it smokes every major prime algorithm there is and all of them have pages on wiki as I cited.

So 2012 a work on Github verifies how important to primality the 30mod spirals are, but he says croft spirals, well guess what HelixQ is now out there and taking 100% credit for the 1995 work of Dr. Adoni.

My site to a Drexel math site from the 1990's mentioning 30Mod prime work (prime spirals) is a major cite, since Adoni could care less about the AMA or whatever, in all probability he will soon be nominated for a Nobel on his work, that is how important it is. 

Think about it, not one prime algorithm could beat the ancient sieve of Eratosthenes, none of them. On a computer creating primes all other algorithms are terribly slow. The only two fast generators from scratch are the ancient sieve of Eratosthenes and the PRIME SPIRALS, and the winner was Prime Spirals. Now I can cite recent news articles about it, laughing at academics it links to that said it was no big deal in the 1990's who now all look foolish due",0.14285714285714285

Sphinx Facing Leo vs Orion Rising - Witness to God

The real reason for the Sphinx is that at the top of Orion , above the shoulders is a faint face , the very same face as the face of the Sphinx, and additionally, this face did formally, paint the side of the great pyramid to shows its clear outline and facial details , which are the same as the face of the Sphinx (before the local massive desecration by the Muslims who defaced all 3 pyramids by removing the outer very polished face of all 3 pyramids). And that face there at top of Orion and the same face as the Sphinx, IS the face of Allah/God there for all to see and there projecting on the side of the great pyramid, before that gigantic desecration of Allah by Muslims.

In addition, this alignment at the time of ORION RISING (at sunrise) ALSO predicts the time of the coming of Allah/ God / Jesus (about NOW) the reason for the alignment. AND HOW could the builders of the Sphinx and the Great Pyramids know all this, by revelations from God/Allah, and NOT ALIENS flying about to TEACH THEM.

This face is also more universal than even this, as the Srinagar, India Buddha, on side of small hill in India has the very same face (instead of the usual, many generic stylized normal Buddha faces) and this particular Buddha is thought to be Maitreya , which is the Buddhist version of Jesus Second Coming.... And on and on.... Now Look Up & SEE ,

f.n. and that face of the Sphinx (heavily damaged by mainly those firing rifles at it again in huge desecration) but STILL visible adequately to anyone giving a little thought to it ,,,, is ALSO the 'pillar at the border of Egypt , a witness to GOD/Lord (not a witness to you but a witness to God himself, who is ALLAH as there is ONLY ONE GOD) as it IS HIS FACE, see Isaiah 19: 19 - """"In that day shall there be an altar to the LORD in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof to the LORD."""" please add above to 'correct' whole article thanks 47.18.43.166 (talk) C, MP

 Some tips for making your stubs a bit better 

Apart from your over-reliance on Soccerway (which isn't always a WP:RS), I've noticed there are some other aspects of your created articles which need substantial improvement. Typing """"player who plays"""" is poor English, try to put """"footballer who plays..."""" or """"soccer player who represents..."""" The word """"currently"""" is pretty pointless too - I mean, they either play for the team or they don't, right? Also, try not to say they play for Bayern Munich in the Frauen-Bundesliga. Put of the Frauen-Bundesliga instead, because they play matches for their teams outside the league too. Please remember to always put the stub tags at the bottom of the article, this will draw attention to the fact that your creations require expansion and improvement. These are just small suggestions, but hopefully by taking this advice you will get better and eventually take some steps on the path to becoming a worthwhile contributor. Thanks,   """,0.0

wikipedia entry on ten-string guitar can no longer be considered reliable 

It has been a battle to keep the wikipedia entry on """"ten-string guitar"""" from being turned into the usual farce that one expects of the """"information"""" presented in both wikipedia and most sites that purport to be about the 10-string guitar (both being 'littered with inaccuracies' and even deliberate misinformation). 

For the time being, I must devote my energies to the final stages of my Doctoral studies and let the fools play at being pseudo-musicologists on wikipedia. It is, however, a disgrace that the first two pages through which most online readers are introduced to """"the ten-string guitar"""" (that is wikipedia and Janet Marlow's tenstringguitar(dot)com) are riddled with inaccuracies, untenable claims, and (as shown in a previous blog) even deliberate distortion of Narciso Yepes's words in an attempt to misrepresent the historical and scientific facts of the matter.

Since I've spoken out about this disinformation, I note that my main page here has suspiciously been deleted from most google search listings containing the terms """"10-string guitar"""" or """"ten-string guitar"""". Some of our American """"colleagues"""" evidently don't like the truth coming out about their dishonest """"scholarship"""".

As for wikipedia, be advised that I no longer oversee the accuracy of the """"ten-string guitar"""" page and this should now be considered as unreliable as most of the other misleading ten-string guitar sites. The person presently responsible for the (from a musicological/organological point of view) misinformative wikipedia entry is Andrew Alder, whose musical """"expertise"""" as far as I can gather is limited to playing drums and rhythm guitar in his local Sydney Anglican church. Yet he too deems himself an """"authority"""" who is in a position to """"educate"""" readers about the 10-string guitar (an instrument he has no doubt never played).  

It is exactly this problem with wikipedia (that any lay person can edit it and can even become an administrator if they have too much free time on their hands and are willing to kiss enough derriere) that has caused it to be banned by universities and to be blamed for """"making kids dumb"""" and for falling grades of students who turn to this misinformative online """"encyclopaedia"""" for research.

Details2: I can understand that you would like to have the whole thing rewritten to cast a more favorable light on TFI but your statement that nothing is all black or white does not fit with regards to your description of FFing. Berg's letters, his language, Marias language and letters, letters such as """"Make It Pay"""" """"God's Whores"""", The King Arthur Series, and many many more, make it clear that FFing was prostitution with a sordid twist of Jesus being behind it all. I think if someone from NAMBLA said """"Our detractors say we molest little boys but we say we show them love, nothing is black and white"""" that a minority of people, probably molesters themselves, would see it that way.
I don't think the public gets a fair view of TFI since they don't have access here to read for themselves the full content of those letters and many others. Letters like #3029JNR- Loving Jesus Part 3-JETTS is but one letter that has statements showing that certain practices should not be revealed to outsiders. If TFI has nothing to hide, """"Burn After Reading"""" letters would never have been necessary. Despite precautions, publications continue to leak from TFI as people jump ship.

Canderra's claims are idiotic at best.  I am not surprised that the leftists don't care as they have shown no dicipline for allowing information contrary to their own beliefs.  Even the most insane excuses are accepted by them.

The first is that these texts are acknowledged to have not been written by Aristotle, but are often attributed to him.  The second is that translations are difficult and often there's a thin line between literal translations becoming unreadable to a modern reader, and interpretations that help with understanding the original texts.  There's many """"introductions"""" to Aristotle that make this point.  Aristotle in outline By Timothy A. Robinson or Aristotle By Christopher John Shields make similar points, as does A new Aristotle reader By Aristotle, J. L. Ackrill.  The Clarendon translations are often cited as being a set of references translations, translates the passage as """"In this sea are situated two very large islands, the so-called British Isles, Albion and lerne, which are greater than any which we have yet mentioned and lie beyond the land of the Celts"""".

Romanization for words of English origin
On the MOS:JP talk page, a discussion has been started about including or not including romanizations for words of English origin, such as Fainaru Fantajī in  (for the sake of simplicity, I called this case """"words of English origin"""", more information on semantics here).

Over the course of a month, it has become apparent that both the parties proposing to include or not include those romanizations cannot be convinced by the arguments or guidelines brought up by the other side. Therefore, a compromise is trying to be found that will satisfy both parties. One suggestion on a compromise has been given already, but it has not found unanimous agreement, so additional compromises are encouraged to be suggested.

One universally accepted point was to bring more users from the affected projects in to help achieve consensus, and you were one of those selected in the process.

What this invitation is:
 You should give feedback on the first suggested compromise and are highly encouraged to provide other solutions.
What this invitation is not:
 This is not a vote on including or excluding such romanizations.
 This is not a vote on compromises either.

It would be highly appreciated if you came over to the MOS:JP talk page and helped find a solution. Thank you in advance.   """,0.0

In the """"Dragonlance Legends"""" series (Weis and Hickman) R goes back in time to learn the rest of F's secrets, and they have a magic battle. While the victor is considered to be R, and goes by R, he actually possesses the memories/abilities of both, and they both had the desire to become a god by destroying Takhisis,  so it is unclear which one actually survived the battle.

 Re:CUplex 

Hello Tungilik!

Unfortunately, you cannot, even tough you work and have access information at the City of North Battleford because no original research says """"original research used on Wikipedia to refer to material—such as facts, allegations, and ideas—for which no reliable, published sources exist"""" which means if an article has no sources it cannot be notable and hence counted as original research per General notability guideline.

Make sure that your sources must be reliable, if you want to know if a source is reliable. WP:SOURCE says """"a source material must have been published, the definition of which for our purposes is made available to the public in some form. Unpublished materials are not considered reliable"""" You can use university-level textbooks, books published by respected publishing houses, magazines, journals and mainstream newspapers as reliable sources. Never use blogs as sources as WP:NEWSBLOG says """"Never use blog posts that are left by readers as sources. For personal or group blogs that are not reliable sources.""""

Wikipedia strongly prefer """"free"""" files, wherever possible. When no """"free"""" file exist, it sometimes to ask a permission to use a non-free (copyright-protected) file under the """"fair use"""" provision. Ideally, most free files should be uploaded to Wikimedia Commons instead of Wikipedia. 

In uploading images, only logged in users with autoconfirmed accounts are allowed to upload images. Now, you first find out whether the image is legal in the United States (where the Wikipedia servers are located) also, if the image has not been released (to your knowledge) under a license, and is still under copyright you must gain permission to use the image from the copyright holder. Next if you're finish, determine which image copyright tag is applicable for your file.

In the procedure of uploading it, You can upload an image by using the Upload file link on the left side of the main page under Toolbox. Use good filenames because some filenames (such as highly generic filenames produced automatically by digital cameras) are disallowed, and attempting to use them will generate an error message.

Example of good file names:
 """":Image:City of London skyline from London City Hall - Oct 2008.jpg""""
 """"Sir John Betjeman (1906-1984).jpg""""

Example of bad file names:
 """"Image01.png""""

2D versus 3D Reconnection

I'd just like to make a comment. This article does a fine job describing reconnection in 2D. The 3D generalization is not trivial though. In 3D sweet-parker or petcheck reconnection effectively becomes 3D null-point reconnection (without getting into quai-separatrix layers versus true separatricies). In addition, the application to the Magnetosphere is very different than the application to the solar corona, in that magnetospheric reconnection topologically requires a 4-flux system, whereas the solar corona requires only a 2-flux system.

Okay, I didn't realize how technical this article was going to be until I started writing it.  I'll make an effort to fill in some of the empty links, provide a diagram or three, and place links to this article on the relevant pages.

I'm currently conducting an experiment to study magnetic reconnection - if you have questions, post them here or on my talk page...  but be warned, I'll be at a conference for the next week, so my response may be slow. 00:51, 14 Nov 2004 (UTC)

I removed an anonymous edit that claimed magnetic reconnection occurs when the magnetic pressure exceeds the plasma pressure (ie when the plasma  parameter is less than unity).  This is not the case!  Magnetic reconnection (or the lack thereof) is related to the line-tying effect of high electrical conductivity, not to the magnetic pressure.  

Zowie. While you are correct that reconnection occurs in both high and low beta plasmas, the process is local and does not depend on whether the system is line tied or not. Formally, magnetic reconnection is the tearing mode, of resistive MHD instability theory (see Furth, H.P., Killeen, J., and Rosenbluth, M. N., 1963, Phys. of Fluids, 6, 459). Several researches have shown line-tying the system simply slows the (linear) tearing mode growth rate (see Velli, M. and Hood, A. W., 1989, Sol Phys 119, 107; Velli, M., Einaudi, G., and Hood, A. W., 1990, ApJ, 350, 419).  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 137.79.89.69   

Topology rather than current sheets

I took the liberty of reducing the discussion of current sheets, which are not directly related to reconnection (they are in some sense a symptom of lack of magnetic reconnection!) and instead introduced separatrix surfaces and separators, the topological terms describing the domain boundaries.  (Note that separatrices, and magnetic reconnection, can exist in a vacuum, while current sheets cannot).  

The discussion still needs considerable work, some work on the X-point figure (it would be nice to have the seapratrices and separator marked), an perhaps a 3-D figure to visualize domain topology  but I'm out of borrowed time for today.  

Happy new year!  

While it is true that topological separatricies exist independent of the plasma, reconnection cannot occur in vacuum. Reconnection absolutely requires a plasma, because it's the plasma that supports the dissipative current sheets that form along these separatricies.

Dissent about """"Magnetic Reconnection?""""
Should notable peer-reviewed papers dissenting with the theory of magnetic reconnection be included in the article?

If so, Nobel prize winning plasma physicist Hannes Alfvén (the so-called """"Father of MHD"""") has dissented in several articles (Double Layers and Circuits in Astrophysics, On frozen-in field lines and field-line reconnection), calling """"magnetic merging"""" (""""reconnection"""") a pseudo-science. More recently, electrical engineer Don Scott has also published a dissenting paper (Real Properties of Electromagnetic Fields and Plasma in the Cosmos).   

Of course not. That would be scientific heresy. This is about proping up failed theories and supporting misguided research.

To quote Alfvén:
The conecepts 'frozen-in magnetic field lines' and 'field-line reconnection' play a certain role in discussions of the theory of the magnetosphere.  The use of these concepts has been criticized and we shall here demonstrate that both concepts are unnecessary and often misleading.

 What are you talking about? 

Excuse me, I have no idea what you are talking about.  What do you mean by """"stalking""""?  I came across The Intruder and thought I could make it a little better.  I reorganized it, put in headings, added some wikilinks, deleted your signature (unlike blogs, Wikipedia editors don't sign articles), and took out some clear violations of WP:NPOV.  How is this stalking?  I haven't followed you around to any articles you have edited and vandalized them.  I don't recall how I came upon the article, my contributions list show it was just after some vandalism reverts  where I often find articles of interest, whether vandalized or not.

Many editors with blogging background don't realize that article listings for movies, books, theatre, etc. are not reviews.  Such quotes as, """"'The Intruder' contains William Shatner's best and bravest lead role, played to the hilt, and the hilt disappears into Adam Cramer,"""" are perfectly fine in a review, but not in Wikipedia.  You might want to read Wikipedia policy concerning original research.  If you can find similar sentiments in the print media or other such source, then, by all means, add it and reference it.  Don't worry about getting the format correct, put the information in the article and other editors will fix it up to conform to Wikipedia's manual of style.  You might want to look at other articles for movies to get a feel for the format.  Eventually, the """"original research"""" part of your contribution will be deleted.  If not by me, then by another editor.  I've found it better to anticipate that and write my articles accordingly.

As for Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/What Really Happened (2nd nomination), I made my comments and have moved on.  Lots of editors make comments on deletion articles every day.  I have commented on several hundred AfDs (Articles for Deletion).  For the most part, I don't recall what any individual says 5 minutes after I click the save button.  Sorry, but I don't recall your comment, nor whether you are for or against deletion (although, I presume you took the opposite stance from me).  I read enough to get a feel for the arguments, did some research, and came to a decision.  In the past I have pushed delete and the articles were kept.  Other times I pushed for keep and the articles were deleted.  That is the nature of AfD.

On a more immediate, practical matter, you said, """"This is a poor time of year for a lot of people—first you have Thanksgiving weekend in the United States, and then you have a massive uptake in work around December"""". Can you assist by suggesting when is good and when is bad? Is Nov/Dec out? I can't imagine anything but towards the end of the year would work, and changing the dates of tenure of arbs would be a major shift.  (talk) """,0.0

What I am saying is that what you placed as last warning does not qualify by any standard as warning material. As well, placing a block for incivility directed at your person isen't the right thing to do, usually an experienced administrator leave this sort of thing being settled by another administrator. I admit, """"he started it"""" is not an excuse, but neither is claiming that you only warn when you see things, you seem to have a rather selective sight here. I just request that you leave another administrator to handle the situation, and I consider you personally involved, of course you can ignore my considerations, but this is not the most respectful thing to do. Incivity is always the easiest thing for an administrator that does not bother to check the situation, but in comparaison to edit warring POV pushing, intimidations, suckpopetry, threats, it is absolutly nothing. And here is where your decision is not only unfair but had you decided to check the situation, there could have been no way in all impartialy taken that decision. Again, I request you to leave this being handled by another administrator, I question your impartiality in your uses of administrator power.  (ix)

 The Truth About Me, Stephen 

Hello, you sexy little love-hole!
I am seeking hot, kinky sex; that is why I am here.  I am seeking a large, hairy, ape-like man to discipline me.  I like it when big men talk dirty to me whilst pounding their rock-hard schingslongs into my mangina; just thinking about it makes my tiny little micro-penis perk up like Hitler on meth. I want a big, strong man to beat me up whilst another muscular hunk restrains me and whispers obscenities into my innocent little ear.  I especially like it when I am called 'a cum-guzzling, dick-sucking, fellating, felching, shit-sniffing, nigger-worshipping, homosexual man-slut,' for I know, in my heart, that this description of me is extremely accurate.  Please, big, hairy men, I want to be your ass-slave, serving you and satisfying you with my bunghole for as long as my submissive soul remains in this world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1111one1111won11  I will even pay you large sums of money if that is necessary.  Contact me as soon as possible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!one1111111111111111won1111

 Removed content 

I removed the following content which seems to be not particularly well-sourced, and a bit off topic - seems more related to a public relations type page, but I can't find exactly where it'd fit best, if anywhere at all.

""""==Two-Way Communication in Public Relations==
Two-way communication can be contrasted with [[broadcasting]], a one-way form of communication.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Two-way communication uses communication to negotiate with the public, resolve conflict, and promote mutual understanding and respect between the organization and its public(s). 

There are different types of two-way communication in public relations; symmetric and asymmetric.

'''Two-way asymmetric'''
*Employs social science methods to develop more:'''Persuasive communication'''
*Generally focuses on achieving short-term attitude change;
*Incorporates lots of feedback from target audiences and publics;
*Is used by an organization primarily interested in having its publics come around to its way of thinking rather changing the organization, its policies, or its views.

'''Two-way symmetric public relations'''
*Relies on honest and open two-way communication and mutual give-and-take rather than one-way persuasion;
*Focuses on mutual respect and efforts to achieve mutual understanding;
*Emphasizes negotiation and a willingness to adapt and make compromises;
*Requires organizations engaging in public relations to be willing to make significant adjustments in how they operate in order to accommodate their publics;
*Seems to be used more by non-profit organizations, government agencies, and heavily regulated businesses such as public utilities than by competitive, profit-driven companies.Source: Managing Public Relations by James E. Grunig and Todd Hunt, 1984

I had these diseases since 2006 and was rediagnosed in April of 2012 finding a dangerous result when the neurologist did a electro-conductor test on my left leg.  I take tai chi and kung fu and have a Chinese foot massage once a week.  My endocannabinoids are healing my left foot and in the mean-time with my rilutek tremendously slowing down these diseases.

This whole conversation is rediculous as the colors on a flag are meant to represent different ideas or ideals. What we decide to call that color has everything to do with what is meant by that color. By calling it yellow one is neglecting to fully appreciate the meaning behind the choice of gold as a flag color is meant to convey an idea, that of eternal and original wealth and prosperity. It has nothing to do with being high and mighty regarding the naming of a color. That is a reactionary and frankly stupid position to hold. Flags are symbols meant to illustrate various ideas and they use images and colors, like all other forms of symbolism, to do this. Thus, the use of gold on a flag is in no way an attempt to sound more high and mighty, but rather a way to communicate.... you dolt",0.14285714285714285

I think you are doing a lousy job polluting valid information with complete garbage. So, I will no longer link to the wikipedia Clan Davidson """"article"""" and will link to the correct history: ACCORDING to the Highland manuscript believed to be written by one MacLauchlan, bearing the date 1467, and containing an account of the genealogies of Highland clans down to about the year 1450, which was accepted as authoritative by Skene in his Celtic Scotland, and believed to embody the common tradition of its time, the origin of the Davidsons is attributed to a certain Gilliecattan Mhor, chief of Clan Chattan in the time of David I. This personage, it is stated, had two sons, Muirich Mhor and Dhai Dhu. From the former of these was descended Clan Mhuirich or Macpherson, and from the latter Clan Dhai or Davidson. Sir Aeneas Macpherson, the historian of the clan of that name, states that both the Macphersons and the Davidsons were descended from Muirich, parson of Kingussie in the twelfth century. You suck, and this site sucks and your edits are complete crap but I'm sure you feel justified somehow in your pathetic view.

"Abuse of 'authority' 
Not to burst your petty little power trip, but it isn't exactly fair game to ban someone just because he was right and you were proven wrong. When someone accuses another of being an 'anti-semite' just because the ADL has labelled him as such, I want to point out to to the Wikipedia audience that however horrible it may be, 'anti-semitism' actually originated from the United States, not Nazi-Germany, though it later adopted it from the likes of Madison Grant and Charles Davenport. Wikipedia's own article on Henry Ford states as much, yet when I bring it up in a Talk section, I get accused by the likes of you for vandalism and banned.

It is the sheer height of hypocrisy that you can go around calling people like me a 'crank' and 'conspiracy theorist', yet I get BANNED by you just because I call you a 'deceptive little creature', which you clearly have demonstrated you are. You can CALL ME all sorts of names, yet I in return am not allowed that privilege. You are deliberately colluding with THF and Collect (two other sockpuppets on Prescott Bush's page) to get rid of as much 'inconvenient' information as possible. Perhaps it's just because you're really clueless and really don't know alot - that would be at least the half-way respectable scenario, and the least weighing on your conscience.

You want your audience (who I presume you want to delude, that is, unless you really DID NOT KNOW Henry Ford published The Elders Of Zion) to remain in a paradigm - without ever knowing where anti-semitism originated from and what a joke it is to see the ones who PROMOTED the concept of 'racial purity' and 'Aryan superiority' to Hitler to remain free of persecution. You use that 'ploy', that 'slogan', 'anti-semite', 'crank', as a silencing technique. It's a deceptive con-game, especially when you never get at the heart of the matter - where the anti-semitism came from, who started the ball rolling, and hey, guess what? The source of origin is a very unlikely one, and very unfortunate and inconvenient indeed for the self-righteous Americans always eager to trot out charges of 'anti-semitism'.

Unfortunately for you, and your sources, Prescott Bush's collusion with the Nazis is a well-established fact, and is well-documented in numerous high-profile books on the subject, including Trading With The Enemy: An Expose of the Nazi-American Money Plot. What you have constructed thus far are 'strawmen' arguments and falling back on 'guilt by association'. You peddle establishment sources as the ultimate harbinger of truth, perhaps KNOWING or NOT KNOWING the complete collusion of mainstream news with the establishment. More unfortunate for you, still, is that President Calvin Coolidge, Woodrow Wilson, Margaret Sanger, the father of JFK and countless other Americans clearly believed in the Nordic/Aryan races' superiority and viewed the Nazis as good. Worse still is that FDR refused to take Jewish refugees from Nazi-Germany. Even worse, university professors were making statements in 1936 to the tune of 'Hitler is beating us at our own game - race hygiene and sterilization'. This is all documented in books such as Edwin Black's 'War Against The Weak' - and don't come with your silly, puny little slogan such as 'conspiracy theorist' just because you don't care and don't want to know.

Unlike you and your petty insults and one-liners, I can back up all these claims with facts and more. I can only conclude that you're a weak-minded yuppie who really does not CARE about the facts, but whether or not you can hang out with your equally deceptive Wikipedians, gain some 'street' credits and keep people in a deceitful paradigm while slandering people who want to break out of your make-believe reality. And of course, being an American, you want to uphold this concocted, grand noble myth that you're the good guys and you fought Nazism. I can only tell you haven't looked into the eugenics history of your own country, or the Royal Institute of Intl. Affairs Conference of 1938. You didn't read Edwin Black's War Against The Weak, haven't you? You haven't read Eugenics And Other Evils by Chesterton, huh?

We live in the information age, sonny. Ignorance is no veil to hide behind - and neither are petty and childish retorts like 'crank', 'anti-semite' or 'conspiracy theorists'. So lose that beard of yours and that smug grin (BTW, not to hurt your ego, but you don't look all that great), quit being so gullible, because I have a newsflash for you, if you keep sticking your head in the sand, you're gonna get hurt real bad too, bubba - by your own masters. The only thing you're doing is discrediting Wikipedia even further by engaging in clear deception.

And if it serves your power trip, go ahead, ban me again. Do what thou wilt. Do your worst, 'bubba'. Show me your power!!!! (ROFLMAO) Your Internet is gonna get shut down soon, bubba",0.0

"Old Stagecoach Trail and Old Santa Susana Stage Road 

Got ur message/question.  I think you were encountering a situation where the NRHP name in our LA list was a red-link and was different than the name of a pre-existing article on the site, and you handled it correctly by revising our list to keep showing the NRHP name (as it is a list of NRHPs) while wikilinking to the pre-existing article.  And you added the NRHP infobox, keeping the NRHP name there (as it should be).  Further, I edited the article intro to mention the alternative name.  And further, i created a redirect at the NRHP name for the site.  I think we talked about how to do redirects a while back....

It would have been similar if the problem had been we had created a new NRHP article already, before finding the pre-existing one.  Then I would have supported merging our material into the older article, and converting our new article into a redirect to the older one.  That gets to the same result as above.  

In mergers, I do think it is courteous to merge the newer article into the older one, so that the older history of edits stays with the article.  Even if the newer article name is better, because the merged article can be moved with its entire long history to the newer name, after.

From the main article about Hugo Chavez:

Chávez was raised a Roman Catholic, although he has had a series of disputes with both the Venezuelan Catholic hierarchy and Protestant groups like the New Tribes Mission. He has traditionally kept his own faith a private matter, but over the course of his presidency, Chávez has become increasingly open to discussing his religious views, stating that both his faith and his interpretation of Jesus' personal life and ideology have had a profound impact on his left-wing and progressivist views. He often invokes God and asks for prayer in speeches, as he did when he asked Venezuelans to pray for Fidel Castro's health.

I don't know how large your local paper is; my experience with larger papers is that they verify the author to at least a basic degree (believe me, the items I was writing about are not nearly as contentious as the matter at hand here, nor am I in a position akin to the rector's.) And in a situation like this, there would certainly be a correction if the rector claimed the letter wasn't his, and no such correction appears. As such, that the rector made the statement seems to me quite adequately sourced, even if the claims he makes are not. However, if you would like to slightly reword it to make it even clearer that the rector is making claims that are not otherwise in evidence (replacing stated with claimed or asserted), I would not have an objection.
I think the claim, even if treated as true, is not much of a claim; the count of accused priests has an invisible """"yet"""" hanging over it, as more recent graduates would have had less time to have accusers come forward than those from previous classes.

"If you read the most thorough and credible works on the subject (see below), you will see that not only did the so-called Zebra murders flow directly from NOI theology, but that they were an NOI operation, directed from Chicago (aka New Mecca), and run out of the San Francisco mosque. The San Francisco death squad had pep rallies run by dignitaries from New Mecca after hours at the NOI-owned moving and storage where most of the killers worked, and all of them worked for NOI-owned businesses.

The apprentice Death Angels had to reach a certain quota from killing either four white children, five white women, or nine white men, in order to become full-fledge Death Angels, and receive free passage to Mecca. The practice of paying free passage to Mecca for killing “white devils” had been  instituted during the early 1930s by NOI founder Wallace Fard.

The NOI even paid for the defense of the three killers who refused to confess (Larry Green, J.C.X. Simon, and Manuel Moore), but refused to pay legal fees for the one killer, Jesse Lee Cooks, who confessed to murder (the Frances Rose killing), and went so far as to disown Cooks. The NOI considers it a mortal sin to confess to any crime in the white man's courts.

To get an indication of how tightly the NOI operation was run, the case was only broken when one of the killers, Anthony Cornelius Harris, came forward, in order to collect the $35,000 reward, get police protection, and new identities for himself and his family. One day, when Harris & Family were in a motel under police guard, and Harris was in the shower, his foolish wife telephoned the wife of her minister, at the San Francisco mosque, and told her where they were holed up. In no time flat, a squad of NOI assassins (Fruit of Islam types, not the raggedy characters in the “Zebra” death squads) showed up at the motel, and Detectives Gus Coreris and John Fotinos just managed to escape with the Harris family seconds ahead of the assassins.

Had the squad managed to kill Harris, the SFPD would never have broken the San Francisco cases (or at least, the 15 official San Francisco cases; there were more killings than that in the city by the bay). As it is, the convictions of Larry Green, J.C.X. Simon, Manuel Moore and Jesse Lee Cooks “cleared” only 15 killings, and the SFPD was convinced that at least three other men were part of the SF squad alone. However, the San Francisco DA, convinced that it had too little evidence to go to trial against the other three, dropped the charges against them.

The NOI is so tightly knit in its devotion to killing whites, whom it variously teaches are “white devils,” “blue-eyed devils,” and “grafted snakes,” that no one else came forward with information.
 
Not only did the NOI organize the death squads (there were many more than the one that went down), but the killings went on up and down the State of California, with different squads working different areas, and according to the FBI, even (though apparently, or rather, hopefully, to a lesser degree) on the East Coast. Dick Walley, the head of the Intelligence Analysis Unit at the California Department of Justice, had a dossier of 71 black-on-white murders committed across the state that he was convinced were NOI killings (Howard). (Walley died of cancer before the trial.) Clark Howard, the author of Zebra, was convinced that the NOI had murdered “just under 270” whites across California, but never named the other 255 victims, or explained his rationale. Since the murders were through and through an NOI operation, and only a small minority of them (even using Walley’s figure, which did not count non-California NOI racial killings) were committed in San Francisco, I suggest that we dispense with calling them the “Zebra Murders,” and simply call them the NOI Murders.

Contrary to those who have claimed that the NOI was seeking with the killings to cause a race war, the NOI was prosecuting a race war. The real story of how that war was stopped is one that I’m afraid we’ll never learn.

 My Two Cents 

 Political correctness will be the end of our world as we know it. This is sad that political correctness has come to this level. It is causing our society to reward failure and condone criminal behavior. This is sad. We might as well change the constitution and exclude freedom of speech. This is next. Truly sad. Truly sad, indeed. 

 Also, regardless what you want to refer to the chinese as, china is the reason why the US's economy is in the crapper, and why our unemployment rate is higher than it has been since the early 1980's.

I agree to some of your claims and appreciate your suggestions but I would like to point out that you have removed literally all statistics and some of them are clearly appropriate. I've deliberately put life expectancy """"in comparison to other advanced economies"""" to make it clear - the comparisons give a clear indication of the progress S Korea has made and is not a POV. You can find such comparisons in almost all economy section of country articles, such as that one in Portugal. In other words, some comparisons are appropriate and should not be completely removed. As I say, you reverted all of my edits, so I did agree with some of your edits, which I left out or reworded in an appropriate manner. I do agree with the picky statistics, and removed comparisons in industrial outputs. For all comparisons made, I included reason why it is made, so it is made clear that it is not a POV. Some of your claims are vague, such as """"due to its healthy manufacturing base"""", which clearly points to original research. You have also removed the IMF forecasts without a valid reason, which is clearly appropriate to show where S Korea is heading right now and useful in demonstrating the speed at which it is growing. I do agree to the technology section and removed some comparisons. My point is that you can't remove all the statistics just because you/or some Wikipedia readers think it is making comparisons - achievements should be recognized and the best way to do so is through comparison. If you have an issue with my new edit, please feel free to talk to me but be very specific about what you disagree with. Thanks.   """,0.0

I also support to move to the philosophy page. I would comment further, but Yworo has said pretty much everything. The statistics are wrong due to the redirect forcing users to go to the operating system first; and the operating system (along with everything else on the disambig. page were named after the philosophy. While the OS may be the primary topic for north american and european users, you cannot say the same thing for the people of asia or africa or anywhere else in the world. Furthermore, Yworo is correct. Wikipedia's guidelines aren't written in stone. Read WP:BURO and WP:BATTLE. In Canada, the Supreme Court ruled in one case that the laws of Canada (or any nation) aren't black-and-white, but rather a series a guidelines for which to abide by, leaving room for interpretation and circumstance. This is essentially the same for Wikipedia. Anyways, The primary usage of Wikipedia isn't a search engine such as Google, Bing, Yahoo, it is an encyclopedia.

 Josephine Baker 

I'd like to ask that you review the talk portion of the sexuality section on Josephine Baker's page. My discussion went off on a tangent with Malik Shabazz when it really should have included you as well. The Jean Claude Baker book on Josephine Baker seems biased and unacceptable. For example, he states at the beginning that he """"hated her"""" and refers to himself eighteen times on the first page. Since he did not meet her until she was 52 it seems inappropriate to rely on his claims about her life when she was 20 or 30. The blanket statement """"Baker was bisexual,"""" written as if it indisputable, really has to go, don't you think? There is no evidence given except the claim of a fan who changed his name to hitch onto her celebrity.

So that is what I did and proposed the image to be deleted (because it was not going to be in use). The only other image I proposed to be deleted was the wrong logo of a proposed bid. It was never my intention to edit war, but again GB fan felt otherwise to revert everything I did even when I left valid explanations. I was frustrated at the time and over the past two months have cooled down and am ready to return to the project. TalkContributions  """,0.0

 Aztec society 

Gidday Richard, I note that you've swapped some text about between Aztec society and Daily life in the Aztec Empire articles. I think it's fine to rationalise the arrangement on these topics, however I have some reservations about the latter of these two articles. It was one of a brace of Aztec and Maya articles (see for eg Mayan Trade, Mayan Food) all created around the same time in September by about 4 or 5 first-time editors, and they all have the hallmark of coming from some more extensive essay on the subject area. I'm not saying that there's copyvio involved here, my guess would be that it's almost like some joint class assignment has been broken up into separate articles. They are based on reasonable material, but they contain a number of evident misinterpretations and have more of a school essay feel to them. They need considerable work and rearranging, and in some instances I really wonder whether it is worth the effort as they cut across topics already covered in the main Aztec/Maya articles.

Just so as you know and something to bear in mind if distributing their contents across other articles. The images which came with the Daily Life article are also I believe mis-tagged as the contributor's own work, when clearly they seem to be taken from elsewhere.

This is one of those instances in which reductio ad absurdem is a helpful and persuasive rhetorical argument.  I get it.  I understand your point-of-view, and I'm sympathetic.  I'm not even disagreeing.  I only explain that disambiguation for the ships of the CP fleet is informed by a consensus:
(a) I understand that this consensus is not one which you unquestioningly accept. 
(b) You clarify the ambit of this """"consensus"""" by pointing to Wikipedia:Naming conventions (ships). 
You announce that your background has to do with articles about military ships, and this informs my measured and somewhat cautious response.  In the period in which I was more engaged in developing the articles about this relatively small fleet. I was not inattentive to the consequences of lexicographical order  see Taxonomy#Military taxonomy.  
 RMS Empress of China  disambiguation
 RMS Empress of China (1921)  disambiguation

Bottom line: I have not reverted nor disputed your recent move; but I'm disinclined to move too quickly in moving each article about a ship in this fleet again  see  here and  here; see also
 RMS Empress of Britain >  Empress of Britain  disambiguation
 RMS Empress of Britain (1930) >  Talk:RMS Empress of Britain (1931)#Redundant useful links

I don't quite understand the point-of-view which appears to argue that the distinction between military and non-military vessels should reasonably extend to this minor issue of disambiguation. Application of the phrase """"consensus reality"""" in our Wikipedia context is one of those  lessons learned the hard way.  I'm still investigating the nuance of unintended consequences.  

For example,  was moved by  to RMS Empress of Australia, and the disambiguation date was simply deemed unnecessary at this point.  This edit is entirely justified, of course; but the modification fails to take into account an article which has yet to be created about RMS Empress of Australia (1953).  As you know, this trivial misjudgment doesn't matter, if indeed the term """"misjudgment"""" can be applied at all  which perhaps makes it an excellent illustration of a grey area.    """,0.0

My edit as follows
Xbox One gets to know you. It learns what you like and what you don’t. And brings it all together on your own personal home screen. And because every Xbox One comes with Kinect, it responds naturally to your voice, movements, and gestures.  The Xbox one kinect can scan through clothes to gain information about your muscle tension and reflexes for a seamless gaming experience.  The kinect sensor detects when you are smiling, crying, angry, or bored. Every detail of your face is recorded to gain an insight into your likely mood. Even your heartbeat is measured and your motions can be seen in the dark. 
I've worked on several versions of this, and our self titled """"Edit Dictator"""" has been telling me it is not neutral or that I am implying something. Then he changes his argument to saying that I am duplicating information; How is information duplicated when what I add is not there in the first place?
You my friend are well advised to spread the word about the bias and censorship here that is especially prevalent in the Xbox one article 
Spread the word; Bias is used to remove pertinent information, Dissent/Criticism is silenced, And you are told that you are the one not being neutral when adding to the article.
Last time I checked, almost every major article on Wikipedia has not just links to it's subtopics but either short clips or brief summaries from the subtopic article pages added into the main article.
Apparently here in Xbox One it is different.
Double standards continue to be enforced and trust me, this information is neutral. These are facts.

I am extremely sorry for my work done in Wikipedia.I understand i am a very poor editor and need some time in perfecting my editing skills.I was under the impression the Hindu paper releases the images in the said license.The purpose of this is to convey to you my sincere apologies for any inconvenience you have experienced during these few weeks.
I just returned from college  and found your message in my talk page.I have also seen the complaints made against by another user.I have in a true sense not vandalized Wikipedia but wanted others to get authentic information.I have use the information from government websites.If i have done something wrong,please correct me.
Sir, let me assure you that what happened was not vandalizing but out of laziness to provide citations.Can i copy the info from the info from govt websites and then add citations and references??(  )",0.0
"you been great Rob, I can see why and where perfect is coming from. I can let all this cool down and I can stop editing a page, I don't think a  indef block was appropriate, I was practically defending myself every day, also perfect made a reference to information online that we had a past, did you read that whole slam page perfect it also says I rape my family and killed other people from my actions, just want to give you a heads up, thanks for absorbing the worst possible reasons online to block me. never mind the back and forth between me and wikicohen, I am sure you took all of that into account first right,...sigh",0.14285714285714285
"USS NAUTILUS SSN-571 Collision with USS ESSEX CVS-9, April 1967 

I was a junior officer serving in ESSEX in 1967 as a CICWO. At the time of the collision I was soundly asleep in the junior officer bunkroom tucked under the flight deck in the forward section of the ship (We were standing Port and Starboard watches under Condition 1 AS, a modifified form of anti-submarine battle stations) when a loud noise was heard and a brief shudder passed through ESSEX, a 29k ton anti-submarine aircraft carrier. ESSEX went promptly to general quarters which is standard operating procedure for protecting a naval ship in the case of a collision of unknown proportions or a fire not under control as the crew immediately mans their battle ststions, including manning damage control parties, and sets Condition Zebra which secures all water-tight hatches throughout the ship.

ESSEX, her task group comprised of several destroyer and destroyer escorts, and NAUTILUS were conducting exercises in the Virginia Capes Operations Area (VACAPESOPAREA. ESSEX was being replenished underway by a fleet oiler and both ships were being screened by the escorts. The wind was backing and the UNREP ships were altering ROMEO CORPEN (replenishment course) five degrees to port to put the relative wind 355 degree relative to their ship's head. NAUTILUS successfully penetrated the screen and was simulating torpedo attacks when she apparently miscalculated either her submerged depth and/or the course of the mainbody. NAUTILUS's conning tower struck ESSEX which draws 29 to 30 feet depending on how she is loaded, on the forward port quarter of her bow-mounted SONAR. NAUTILUS was believed to roll to starboard and to pass under ESSEX keel rerighting herself as she executed an emergency surfacing procedure in he vicinity of ESSEX elevator on her starboard side, some 500-600 feet from her bow. 

NAUTILUS appeared as though the forward leading corner of her sail area had been bitten cleanly off. Injuries were minor to two NAUTILOS crewman and to a Sonarman First Class in ESSEX. NAUTILUS did not suffer any apparent damage to her nuclear reactor or powerplant. No leaks of radioactive material were reported as testimony to her thorough construction. ESSEX's bow mounted sonar was badly dented/deformed but the ship's water-tight integrity was never breached, and she transited to the Boston Naval Shipyard for repairs and deployed in late May 1967 for an EASTLANT NATO Anti-submarine exercise (ASWEX).",0.0

Partial consensus reached
This is Florida election night, so we really should enjoy ourself, and get on with improving this article. Therefor I would like to sum up what we have reached so far. As i see it we have concensus on most parts. Concensus meaning no one goes from the table happy, but nobody goes from the table with empty hands.
I have been bold and put in a new table, where I have incorporated much of what have been said in this discussion and other dicussions on the talkpage. Please read through this before undoing it.

Main Consencus: The table gets to stay, but it have to be changed

Lets go through the table colum by colum:
Date colum. Consensus: Days and years are gone to make it more elegant. Action: I have removed this from the colum
State colum. Consensus: No argument. Action: None
Type colum. Consensus: No argument. Action: I have removed the nonbinding/binding in caucus. It really couldnt explain the complex ways of the caucus. And it is redundant if the delegate count will be unbound/bound. Then everyone can see what kind of caucus it is anyway.
Delegates colum. Consensus: It have to change to something neater and easyer. Action: I have made two colums, unbound and bound. It is neater ) But more important. Personally I think it is the most important and educationel part of the table. So many comments on this talkpage shows that many have no idea what races actually gives delegates to the candidates and how many. Just read the discussions on the delegate count in the infobox. And the main tv channels dont help either. This will show how the delegates really are going.
Allocation colum. Consensus: No one in this dicussion, but on 3 other sections on this talkpage have been requesting it. Action: I have tried not to make it a tell-everything-in-depht colum as the old table have been accused to be. I have keept a very complex election cycle as simple as I could, without actually stating false fact. I feel this colum is important because in many ways this is new from the 2008 race. The complexity and the fact that many races are proportional means that a long race have a bigger chance of ending in a brokered convention. An fact that is important to educated about. And this can be seen out of this colum.
Winner, second and third colum. Consensus. Not yet reached. Action: I have kept them so far. And it is up to you all (me included) to figure out what to do.~
Source colum. Consensus: Get rid of it. Action: I have removed it. The references was mostly from the time of the """"schedule war"""" and 95% of those have been replaced with the reference at the end of the remarks in the top of the section (just above the table)

I might be wrong, but onless there is a strong consensus against the Bound and Unbound delegate colums, the only consensus left is about the Winner/second/third colum. No one gets everything (including me) but no one got nothing with this new table.
Now I have been bold, what do you say?    

I support the removal of the Winner, second and third colum. I don't see a reason to list X person as the winner in the infobox, then in this table, then in the subsequent table (immediately after), and then in each of the states own little blurbs on this page. That's similar to me copying this sentence and pasting it four different times in this talk page. Anyway guys, good luck. I am out. If need be, you know where to find me > Chat  23:""",0.0

Also, lol, they make the ISIS pigs hold only 10% of Saker Island for MONTHS now, how on earth they can't take control of that small area that Masdar and Lucem claim they don't hold? Also, Masdar numbers are as far-fetched as SOHR's. Really, they claim 200 Nusra(not counting other rebels) deaths in Shaykh Miskin by 10 of November. After that, we had over a month of a bloody battle, so likely the rebels suffered even more deaths, and they also said that hundreds more of Nusra fighters we're injured. But the estimated number of Nusra numbers in Daara is 3.000. How would they hold together after losing effectively 1/6 of their forces in TEN DAYS, specially since they battled in Shaykh Miskin for a month after that. Yeah, all forces that lose 1/6 of their forces in a single battle, that only in 10 days, are capable of fighting the same battle for a extra month and still be existing. Makes much sense.

The idea is that tetrapods that grows slowly (i.e reptiles) continue to grow in maturity.

Mammalian teeth being complex, replacing teeth requires quite a bit of resources, and as anyone having children of pre-school age can attest to, it is also a lot of bother (try eating an apple without your front teeth!). Thus, for the fast-living, high energy demanding life of insectivorous mammals, tooth replacement is kept to an minimum (i.e two setts, a trait retained in their descendants).

Hi, you recently deleted my userpage, claiming that it was """"Vandalism"""", but I think that your actions were improper.  My page was certainly not created by """"vandalism"""" (how can I vandalize my own userpage?), and that  it's offensive to you is irrelevent (the Armenian """"genocide"""" page is offensive to me).

I'm pretty sure you would be the type to go up to such people like Fred Phelps or George W.

So you think it's fine for people to pay for content generation about their business, and then be featured on Wikipedia's main page seven days a week, at least as long as nobody notices. I can't say I share your opinion. Also, just a little geography: Indonesia has about 8,000 times the population of Gibraltar, and 280,000 times the area. If am being kind to you here, and go by population, then the equivalent of the 44 DYKs Gibraltar has had since July would be something like 350,000 DYKs for Indonesia.

""":It is neither more historically correct, nor more professional. Scholars routinely use the term """"Nazi"""". You cite the Encyclopedia Britannia as evidence of your claim. But, in fact, the Encyclopedia Britanica uses Nazi an order of magnitude more often than National Socialism. In the online version of the Encyclopedia, there are 10,200 references to Nazi and only 1020 references to """"National Socialism"""". And in the title of the entry for """"National Socialism"""", they write """"also called Nazism or Naziism"""". 

Your claim that use of the term """"Nazi"""" is amateurish is a slur on the overwhelming majority of scholars who routinely use the term. The claim that """"National Socialism"""" is a """"more full and correct designation"""" is inconsistent with the fact that the two phrases are synonymous. And while it is true that """"Nazi"""" can be used as an epithet, so can """"dog"""". Do you also recommend that Wikipedia refrain from using the word """"dog"""" to describe dogs? 

It is interesting that you use Linder as support for your argument. The particular passage that you link to is an explanation by Linder as to why he will use the term """"Nazi"""" rather than """"National Socialist"""" throughout his book. I fail to see why this is evidence that Wikipedia should do the opposite.

I am curious about your statement that use of the term Nazi arises from a deeper intent by political opponents to give a skewed view of their politics. What part of Nazi politics do you feel has been skewed by their political opponents?

"""{{unblock|THANK YOU for a reasonable fucking comment!!! The ONLY USER in ANY AREA who has actually made one!!  (Ebyabe made comments which appear to be reasonable at first glance, but are actually unreasonable because one is fraudulent and the other was untrue regarding a place where she could see that it was untrue.)  Well a sort-of reasonable comment anyway because he claims that I am being """"confrontational"""" when it is clearly visible at my talk page that other users are attacking me and not the other way around.  I have not caused any confrontation...   I have replied to other users who are putting a confrontation to me.  (I did ask how to report a user, but I did not actually report him because nobody answered regardless of several posts made, and the user himself did not comment there, so that was not a confrontation like it would have been if I'd been able to make the report.)  I would like to leave a message at this user User:Stwalkerster's talk page but I cannot, because for some reason those are blocked to, so I have to do it this way instead.  Hopefully he has the notifications turned on (tags of username).  I can be calm and work with other people.  This is noted in my first reply, where it gives several examples of how users should have had discussion instead of attacking and reverting me and arguing hostilely on my talk page.  Users who wish to work with me should not make attacks, write words like """"compliance"""", revert edits when they could have further fixed the edit instead (details of referred-to edits in a separate paragraph below, make false claims against me, or delete my replies on discussion pages (not talk pages) and then ARCHIVE it after removing them!!  (Users should not do these kinds of things to anyone.)  What this means is that if users act in a reasonable manner, then a normal discussion can ensue (including from myself).  Merely because someone has used a template, written a shorter reply, or wrote their aggressive, confrontational remarks in a business-style manner, does not mean that they are """"being reasonable"""" or """"writing nicely"""".  When someone makes a falsified report about you or writes a falsified comment, etc., it is not reasonable to expect the victim to reply without mentioning this, or to want to """"be friends"""" with the attacker.  If the other people are being reasonable then of COURSE I am going to reply to them in a different way.  Editing an article by...(below) is not reasonable, nor is """"ganging up"""" (the discussion page), nor is replying in several places at once, etc.  How can replying to other users stating bad and/or false things about you be """"confrontational""""?  I have mentioned several times about having an actual discussion but no one did this and instead just kept replying on my talk pages.  The fact that I mentioned having a discussion indicates that I think reasonable discussion is the right or reasonable way to do it.  Just no one wanted to do anything but attack me so I did not have another way.

The headlines are not """"veiled"""", they are in plain light.  It was not any attempt to be """"hidden"""".  For headline #5, I literally do or did not know of a different way to title this headline which is not an attack on myself.  For headline #8, it is truthful and the falsification was blatant by Ebyabe, and I actually expected her to edit it to something on her next message.  I mean she directly mentions it; edit summary says a reason but her message says differently (directly, not implied).  For this headline, it is not a """"personal attack"""" because it is true and evident: Administrator complains about my signature even though signature has been changed, and messages by me since posted, before the block happened, as well as direct linking to comments which contain no personal attacks as a reason for """"personal attacks"""".  If the titles were UNTRUE they would be attacks, but since they are true unambiguously then they can't be attacks. The last headline yes, somewhat motivated/hostile, because he is the one put an useless headline so that there's TWO AT ONCE, *AFTER* my notice is up, while also writing the things that show the actual tyranny (a word used in this case solely because it is already being talked about, and not meant as any attack/instigation/hostile/etc.). Although the link by Jamie appears to say something about political opinions, if someone is making false claims then it is appropriate for them to be exposed.

So as you can see my intents are to be reasonable and normal (with the 'possible' exception of this particular headline), and repeatedly asking other people to do this, but being annoyed by all their attacks and false remarks as well.

I then over the following weekend read an article in the Wall Street Journal about this same book and it was more even handed. It made the book sound very intriguing and a good work of scholarship. So I was using Wiki as a tool to help try and see whether or not it was the author of the New Yorker article or the author of the book who was the bigot; or rather whose perspective was being presented in the article. So if Wiki said that she is some type of devout Christian or proud of her Christian heritage, I would be able to make a better determination of which article was more neutral. Or if it said that she was a Cultural Marxist ditto. This is precisely what Wiki is there to help us with. It might sound mundane but if I had all the information that I needed then I would have been able to make the decision to purchase the book.

"""

Let's recap. After the Gibraltarpedia controversy broke last month, existing Gibraltar-related DYK nominations were put on hold while a discussion took place on options for dealing with them and with future nominations. Andreas did not participate in that discussion. Its outcome is summarised in the box at Wikipedia talk:Did you know/GibraltarPediA Options. There was nearly unanimous agreement that DYKs should go forward, as long as they met the DYK requirements and that any COI/promotional aspects were explicitly addressed by reviewers. A temporary requirement for a second reviewer was also added to ensure improved scrutiny of the nominations. As a result of the brief moratorium, a backlog built up of articles that had temporarily been held back from the Main Page. This backlog has now almost entirely been cleared. There has been no suggestion that any specific article should not have run because of being """"promotional"""". Andreas is wrong to claim that there was an agreement to run """"one a day"""". In fact there was no consensus on this suggestion. There are further articles now in the nomination queue, awaiting review, but there is no reason to suppose that they will appear at the same frequency. I anticipate that they will appear over the course of several weeks. 

Let's be clear: Andreas is taking an extreme position that any article on any topic relating to Gibraltar is """"promotional"""" and should not be allowed, even if it passes every DYK criterion and even if there is no conceivable promotional aspect. (Cases in point: Gibraltar Cross of Sacrifice, a war memorial; Trafalgar Cemetery, a disused historic graveyard; Moorish Gibraltar, a history of Gibraltar from 711 to 1462). This position has been rejected by the vast majority of people who have commented on this issue. He cites out-of-context quotes from a YouTube video while ignoring the fact that nobody is directing the development of these articles - people are simply writing about things that interest them, whether or not they have any """"promotional"""" value. He ignores the fact that specific topics have often been the subject of frequent coverage on DYK. Recent examples have included the Olympics and Paralympics, racehorses (120 DYKs), Indonesia (300 DYKs in the last year), mushrooms, Bach cantatas and so on. In absolute terms these have had a far greater amount of coverage and higher frequencies. In short, Andreas is singling out one topic area and numerous good-faith contributors who have written articles of undisputed high quality, on the basis of what a couple of people, who are not writing or directing articles, have said about it.

"""

The user's final edit was to blank his Talk page with the edit summary """"fuck it.""""  The page blanking was reverted """"because of an active block"""".  The block is no longer active, the user has not returned to Wikipedia, and I think it is pretty clear that """"fuck it"""" is the equivalent of """"I am retiring from Wikipedia.""""  It seems to me that if someone has expressed quite clearly that they don't want to come back to Wikipedia and that they don't want their sad saga displayed on their Talk page for all eternity, that is within their rights.
Also, I question whether the initial reversion of the page blanking was even according to policy.  Show me one policy that says you cannot blank active block messages on your talk page, hmmm?  While WP:DRC is merely a guideline, there is a distinct lack of Wikipedia policy limiting what kind of content users can remove from their Talk page.  I happen to think there should be policy limiting what a person is allowed to remove from their own talk page (e.g. warnings <24 hours old and active block notices) but as it currently stands there is no such policy, at least not that I can find.  (If I am wrong, please enlighten me!)
If I have to abide by rules I think are dumb, then so does everybody else.  In fact, that is the difference between us and Karaku  Karaku disagreed with the rules so he chose to aggressively break them and call everyone else ignorant.  I disagree with the rules, but I realize they have been formed by community consensus and so I will abide by them as long as they are in place.  And by my interpretation of the current rules, Karaku's blanking of the Talk page should never have been reverted.  
Furthermore, while I recognize that I was using the word """"VANISH"""" imprecisely, it appears to be a longstanding tradition in Wikipedia that if a user wants to just leave and clear out the ugly history of their wrongdoing, they have the right to do that.  Karaku very clearly indicated a desire to do just that (is there really that much difference between putting a banner saying """"Retired"""" at the top of your Talk page vs. blanking the thing with the edit summary """"fuck it""""?).
Anyway, I'm obviously not going to get in an edit war over a retired user's talk page.  I'm just sort of surprised at the insistence to leave all this stuff in place when the user doesn't want it and Wikipedia policy provides no mechanism to override those wishes...   """,0.14285714285714285

"You got what had been coming to you. I hope that being a k3wL eleet nerd-o-pedia moderator has made your life hell.

- From someone that you totally wronged with your bullshit and managed to get me to stop contributing very significant contributions to this site nearly a year ago now. (And I contributed a LOT in a short time and would have contributed SO much more had I continued. Things that I did: huge amounts of professional class photography given away for free (placed PD) on subjects (often providing the only pics, to this day, on the subjects in question), hundreds of pages formatted according to standards, huge amounts of latest subject matter information added and facts corrected (in some cases so new that this was the first place on the net to have it) etc. etc.) - and instead of helping me and being civil, sensible and using common sense YOU were more interested in defending a non-contributing user who (for no apparent reason) started a campaign of open violent threats, death threats, spamming and vandalism on me. You were having too much fun abusing your moderator privileges by placing temporary blocks on me, trying to stop me from making my point and trying to give this hugely offensive other user a chance to avoid a police investigation, by mod-vandalizing discussions on the subject etc. - against most other moderators (private) views even - they had the sense not to start a mod war on the subject. Your 500 page nerd-o-pedia rule-book and abusing it to the point of idiocy was more interesting to you. Apparently you felt that since you had read it, everyone else should waste at least as much time and read it too down to every last letter, or you were gonna use it against all common sense toward anyone who didn't - with no regard for the actual situation and reasons behind it, no regard for that individuals contributions, no regard for civility - and most of all, with no common sense applied whatsoever.

It's indeed too bad that most pages on nerd-o-pedia are starting to be shockingy un-maintained and obsolete, indeed dead now that the initial rush of contributors is over after a few years, and the fun is over for most people - as, the most brutal blow of all, moderators such as YOU have managed to destroy the morale of even the most serious contributors and have had them leave. They simply did not wish to spend too much time arguing or alternatively face putting up with arrogant admin behavior, because it always will start to take more of your time than contributions here, because of people like YOU, and how wrong the principles are how admins are selected here. It's all about brown-nosing with the crowd and building your giant online virtual ego and lick the ass of other even more OCD nerds who are already admins, and you're just a wannabe. 

Good ****ing luck trying to get anything edited or updated here in a year or two besides top 10 whatever pop bands may be popular at the time, the latest tv show pages and some other obsessive-compulsive nerdishm. Nobody is foolish enough to put up with the crap that comes along with the job, from people such as YOU.

For example, the pages on my subjects were very active till late 2006, and since that they have... well. Remained in the same form as the core contributors left them, as they left this site. No updates. I'm truly not the only one to eject. Not worth the effort to contribute when all you get is shitted all over, if you ever need any help.

It's kind of funny that an admin can burn out of this site too, but given your attitude back then, I'm not surprised you did. After all, there were some decent admins here back then (such as  ), and I'm sure there's a few now, but WAY too many nerds for whom it is the biggest thing of their lives, and they have to show it, and snoop their noses everywhere. But like I said, as even admins are dropping out, what do you think happened to the contributors? Many pages now are actually full of incorrect shit, because no people of expertise hang around any more to correct details, and newbies or worse, malicious trollers slowly degrade the content that once was at least somehow accurate and relevant. Admins will be happy to see updates to the page, but the fact is, most of the updates today are degenerating the pages, obfuscating subjects and adding factual errors and garbage.

And too bad you didn't quit a year ago, I might still be here, and there would probably be several thousands of lines, and few hundred articles more, along with maybe ~1000 more photographs.

"I checked and found that other editor only took out a couple of lines, you took out the whole article, I will appreciate if you would tell me what exactly you think is a proper source as you dont agree on any of the sources that were listed by many editors.  So I would request that in order to make this article better, that we work on this togeather and make it better, rather than getting rid of the whole thing.

For example what is wrong with a picture of a sudhan, or that they are all over the world, I think many sudhans worked on this article and I would defer to them, I was in Kashmir and that is where I learned a lot about Sudhans.

Hi Glcork. Can I suggest you practice on the Sandbox until you get the hang of things? To add an image, see the instructions below: 

For uploading pictures and other media, it's easiest to go to Wikimedia Commons (you can use your Wikipedia credentials if you're not logged in already) and visit the Upload Wizard. Wikimedia Commons can only accept files which anyone can use for any purpose. That means most content you find on the web is not acceptable. But for example, most photos that you've taken yourself are OK to upload.

Here's a screenshot of the Upload Wizard:

You start by selecting the files you want to upload, then you go step by step through the process. In the final step, you'll get some wiki markup that you can copy into a Wikipedia article. Let me know if I can help. -)

Yes, that's how I assumed it worked as well, but where's this """"somewhere else"""" that led to the creation of this article?

You're right that this article is meant to be an extension of another article, but it's currently only an extension of hip hop music and should therefore be called old school hip hop music.

It might be wise to let old school hip hop redirect to old school hip hop music for a while, however, as many other articles link here. When a section about old school hip hop appears in hip hop culture, we could redirect old school hip hop there instead, until that section grows big enough to justify its own article about general old school hip hop, like you said.

In response, there is no exaggeration to the importance of this leisure activity. Video games account for a considerable chunk of the Japanese economy. The fact of the matter is that delays of major video game software or hardware would not only harm the local Japanese economy more than it already has been, but lasting damage of the video game industry could harm the worldwide economy.

"""

You raise a lot of interesting issues. I'll give my thoughts on some of them. First, I think you're right that """"Eric"""" is, at least in some sense, more readable. Second, you're right that we have article titles like Eric I of Norway and Eric VI of Sweden (but also Eirik II of Norway so it's not quite consistent). I think that a high level of Anglicization is expected for the names of royalty where familiar names tend to be used if at all available. If Eiríkr Hákonarson had ever called himself king I would be fine with having his article at """"Eric II of Norway"""". But he wasn't quite royalty and he is a somewhat more obscure historical character than the kings so I'm not quite sure how to apply this. 

As for medieval usage I haven't made a complete study but what I've seen so far is that the Latin charters witnessed by Eiríkr during his life have """"Yric dux"""" (most commonly) or """"Yrric dux"""" or """"Iric dux"""". The Encomium Emmae, written in Latin in 1041 or 1042, has the form """"Eric"""" and titles him as """"dux et princeps provintiae quae Nordwega dicitur"""".

The Anglo-Saxon chronicle (written in Old English, of course) has """"Irke"""" (a dative form) or """"Yric"""" or """"Yrice"""" (a dative form) or """"Eiric"""". (Maybe I missed a variant.)

Old Norse texts are usually published in normalized orthography where the name is """"Eiríkr"""". In diplomatic editions you will probably find forms like """"Eirikr"""" or """"Eiricr"""" or """"Eirijkr"""" but I don't have any at hand at the moment so don't take it as gospel.

I've got to run now, will address the rest of the question later. I'm actually more worried about the patronym )  """,0.0

That is so interesting and amazing. Besides, I wonder the information on Operating Mode. Is the original IA32e mode a sub-Mode of protected mode or a new mode like it in AMD64?

It's quite simple: you find out the number of deaths in each group, and then compare the numbers. While I don't know if the numbers to do that are available to perform such a comparison, I do know that there is an objective """"scientific"""" method for dealing with the issue. There may be outliers as you've pointed out, but the number afforded through the statistical method is still a firm cut off point (and one supported by conventional social science techniques). 

As you yourself have claimed, """"there may be some agencies that have drawn dollar boundaries between industrial and developed countries, but I don't know if they make sense."""" They don't make sense because the cut off is arbitrary. What is """"poverty?"""" What is """"wealth?"""" These are all normative concepts with no rigid definitions.

You say no transwomen believe this, it has been called a riddiculous straw man.  Yet if one goes to tsroadmap.com and/or lynnconway.com and googles (in the search boxes you would see on their pages) """"brain sex"""" they will get many hits.    Read """"The theory that prenatally established brain and CNS   structures determine innate gender feelings and gender identity.""""  """"It appears that if those brain and CNS structures are masculinized   in early pregnancy by hormones in the fetus, then the child will   have male percepts and a male gender identity, independent of   whether the genes or genitalia are male. If those structures   are not masculinized in early pregnancy, the child will have   a female percepts and a female gender identity, again independent   of the genes or genitalia. As in the case of intersex infants   having ambiguous genitalia, there are undoubtedly many degrees   of cross-gendering of brain and CNS structures, so that while   some infants are completely cross-gendered others are only partially   cross-gendered.(verbatim)""""  This is basically the feminine essence theory. When one adds that there is only one way to be cross-gendered in the brain, and that cross gendering must be totally separate in any and every way from sexualorientation. That there is in essence one way to be feminine; that is the feminine essence theory.

Interestingly if I understood JamesCantor correctly in a conversation we had on my talk page.  This is very close to what he and sexologist like him belive. However they contend that the way in which a brain is cross-gendered depends on sexualorientation.  Thus take a homosexual male.  Homosexual males have been shown to think and have some brain structures like those of straight women.  A homosexual transsexual is just a case where there is more enough female brain structure present to make a person mentally female.  While non-homosexual transsexuals, if I understood correctly, also have cross gender structures in their brains, just not the same as a homosexual transsexuals.  The non-homosexual MTF transsexual brains retaining more masculine brain structure.  That is the crux of the problem isn't it now.  That Blanchard's theory not only contradicts the feminine essence/ female brain sex theory of MTF transsexualism....but it then says ok one kind of transsexual really does work that way.

I don't think there will be any issues with my edits per se, as most would have a hard time proving they are detrimental as opposed to beneficial to the articles. Methodology is a different case, and here we get into the grey area of how Wiki guidelines are perceived - the source of so many arguments. No, I don't (heh) have a medical condition. Unfortunately, I have a lot of pride and particularly so in my hobbies, one of which is comics. Having a photographic memory and being able to pretty much cite off the top of my head character appearances does make me a tad arrogant. I have to work on that. As far as I know, I'm the only one that actually rewrites whole FCB's accurately, and while this is great for Wikipedia I sometimes forget that others may contribute in different and smaller ways, as these efforts are no less important.

Taking out the entire Santa Fe Public Library system is a great preemptive strike also. There may be others of his kind, that sympathize with those """"Indians"""". These people actually LOVE the Earth and that is without reliable sources! We kicked their asses and have the right to write THEIR history and interpret THEIR sacred teachings however we please.

Not a single scholar or Mayanist agrees with his appropriated theory and this kind of hypocrisy and arrogance is what Wiki is all about.

 Blossomland 

Any good references to use for the """"Blossomland"""" name? I thought that the one I provided (http://www.hartfordmichigan.com/hartfordhistory/Precious%20Pearls/Blossom%20Song.htm) didn't use synthesis - selected quotes:

""""That the Michigan Blossom Week song, extolling the beauties of blossom land, which was broadcasted from three Chicago radio stations and from Berrien Springs and was sung at the blossom pageant at Benton Harbor last week, was written by a Hartford woman was not known to many local people who 'listened in.'"""" (Hartford is in Van Buren County, listed as in Michiana; Benton Harbor and Berrien Springs are in Berrien, also listed)

""""Music for the song was written by Mrs. Nate Simpson of Keeler"""" (also in Van Buren County)

[lyrics] """"Oh! it's blossom time in Michigan...I can feel the lake breeze blowing"""" Lake Michigan is not specified, but it's the only logical lake in this context - lake breezes/microclimate is only a characteristic of the largest bodies of water, and the largest in the area is Lake Michigan.

I'm not sure if I can find another source with as much detail (I was hoping that there'd be something in the history section of the Blossomtime Festival website, but no mention), but the term definitely has been perpetuated in the area and is part of its identity (note Google search), so it seems notable.

 You People... 
...Are hoping, begging and wishing for previlages, respect a title that you did not earn, go by on your own and are not deserving of.  You did not build the US, you had the Spanish Empire and it failed, not you come here by crossing the border and by boat.  Stop fooling yourselves.  BEFORE the first Spanird came to the Americas, they already had black blood and Asian blood in them!  This is why they are darker.  This is why on the paintings from the Colombua period they had yelolow hues, dark hair, curly hair and full lips.  Yeah, Isabella was red, but Spaniards were never one type of European to begin with.  On top of that, as the Moors got defeated (not actually kicked out of Spain altogether), more Europeans came into the mix and reintroduced whiteness.  NOW, the mulattoized peoples still remained as it is today, especially in Portugal, France and Italy.

Once the Spaniards came over here, mixing was let loose, UNLIKE the rule in the USA!  See, the US was operating on whiteness and a white 'purity' concept.  You guys were operating on being greedy and grabbing land and not knowing what to do with it.  You mixed with the natives and the Africans.  It is more than clear.  In fact, it is so clear that that is all you see.  Only after the US established itself as THE word power (and broke down Spain's empire.  How come they did not do it to France..?), THEN you people started trying to think of yourselves as white.  That only increased as you immigrated to the US and it broke your hearts when you found out that you were not white and landed in the ghetto.

If you sad mixed people don't get it by now - AMerica does not settle for mixes or those who cry about being white, you are or you are not.  If you have noticed in US history and society in general, Spain and Portugal are hardly if ever mentioned in a context with Europe.  You ask the average American where Portugal is they can't tell you.  They may have heard of some people (usually black) calling themselves Portuguese, but have no idea where or what Portugal is.  Spain less so, but white is not associated with Spain.  Even Europe is hardly associated with Spain.

All of this BS about you guys being more pure than American whites is just that - BS.  People know that you are hispanic.  You don't - you can't fool anyone.  Only very few of you look like a 'no questions asked' white person.  I can understand your pain, since many Greeks and Italians are regarded (not exactly accepted) as white, even though clear non-European/African traits are visible.  I guess you would ask """"if they can be white, then why should I not be?""""  Good question, but you people are not doubt mixed and recently.  Italians and Greeks may not have a direct black parent, but you can look at them and see that African beneath the surface.  Some African is on the surface more than the white is!  

Sadly (for those of you with white dreams that is), you are lumped together with the rest of your latino brothers.  Just because things are not going well n ALL of those (so much land and resources) countries, you want to come to the US and get a free ride as whites?  It does not work as easily for you as it may work for others.  One, you ARE NOT coming from Europe, so there is no built-n perception of whiteness based on Europe alone.  Two, you are mixed!  You need to review the history of the US!  Once you do (the 20th century alone will do), you will see that you need not apply as white.  Only the absolute whitest (dying your hair blond or red does not fool anyone for your information) need apply.  You just can't come to a country and get a free ride.  You have ALL of Latin America, instead of making something out of that, you want to come here and try and be white.  No, no.

I still cannot believe how many Puerto-Ricans, Dominicans, Chileans, Argentines and so on truly believe themselves to be white.  I met a femle who thinks she is white.  I keep telling her it is only in her world because it is not in anyone elses.  Spain IS in Europe, but despite popular thought, not all Europeans are white.  You can do your best to lie about the Moors, lies about African savery in Latin America and lie that there was even race-mixing going on, it does not change history and biolgy.

Also, I was already well aware of the hispanic trick of calling white people Anglos, meaning """"your type of whites as opposed to my type"""" which whites don't care about.  You are not seen as white, you are seen as hispanics.  This is why you are (along with Italians and other black mixed Europeans)quick to (try) and be 'racist'(renegade mulatto is more like it) against blacks, thinking that it pleased whites and that it somehow makes you feel white in your mind.  Being white does not mean being a racist.  White is an American (USA) thing.  Most Europeans never thought of themselves as beinga part of a white people.",0.0

I agree with your assessment of the Austen article (obviously). I was planning to do just what you did when I got to my dissertation chapter on Austen. However, I recommend that when the article is complete, that you post a message to the talk page of the Jane Austen article and ask people to comment on your page and invite them to improve it. Replacing the whole page might not be viewed as being bold but as a unilateral assertion of authorship. I know that you have no such intention - I am just letting you know what might happen if you did that. Wikipedia is supposed to work by consensus (this is sometimes effective and sometimes not), so it is often a good idea to solicit consensus to head off any edit wars.

Let me say how happy I am to find someone writing such a thoughtful and thorough page. It is rare for literature articles around here. Also, if you want to work on Samuel Johnson together sometime in the future, please let me know. I belong to an eighteenth-century listserv for academics and that article in particular has been cited on the listserv as representative of the problems with wikipedia. Since I am not a Johnson expert, I have not tried to tackle it yet, but I think that if we work together, we could do a good job.

I hate to bother you, as I'm sure you are quite busy with your dissertation, etc., but I'm in need of someone to copyedit an article that I am hoping to bring to FAC in the near future. I have been working on Battle of Arras (1917) for some time now, and am relatively satisified that it meets the other criteria, but it desperately needs a thorough copyedit, and I was hoping you would oblige. Of course, I understand that you may not have time, and won't be put out if you have to decline (although, if you could recommend someone else for the job, that would be helpful as well).

"connection between 4chan and anonymous and anonymous culture 

I'm not sure the extended section on 4chan users is really necessary in this article.  Here's my formal sounding original reasoning that I thought started sounding too formal:

As it stands, the lines drawn between those three things are rather thin.  While Anonymous does profit from Anonymity, and 4chan users can profit from anonymity, I think there needs to be a more direct connection shown in this article before there needs to be an extended section upon 4chan within the article.  Consider it like this:

My father doesn't like potatoes.  Turnip eaters often don't like potatoes.  My father must eat turnips.
Anonymous profits from anonymity.  4chan users profit from anonymity.  Anonomous members must be 4chan members.

I don't doubt that there are many participants in Anonymous that use 4chan, I'm just not sure it is relevant to the point of extended discussion of Anonymous unless' there is proof that 4chan was the main location where Anonymous was organized.  There have been several sites akin to 4chan both preceding and following, and in addition IRC also served as a gathering place for anonymous individuals to share information collectively - including early hackers.  A discussion of 4chan as a subset of anonymous culture should be listed on cyberculture and 4chan and if necessary on a new page dedicated to anonymous(culture).  This article purports to be about Anonymous as a loosely associated hacktivist group - the focus, thus, should be on Anonymous(group)",0.0

All he does is capitalize the A where people cannot even see it, and where it does not affect anything. I mean, if that does not look like intentional inflating of his contributions to you, I am not sure what will. Here is one where he just changes the phrasing, even though the original phrasing was not problematic: . Maybe that is understandable though. He could just fancy that phrasing more. He skipped over an actual error, though. Winger should not be capitalized. Even if these were necessary, they would be extremely minor, contributions, anyway. He also goes down an endless list of names (though that alone is not weird, until you take into account the type of edits he is making).

It seems like he is simply looking for minor edits. Maybe that is not so wrong, but the act of finding a page would be relatively high cost to most people. They would rather spend time at each page editing. I suppose he devised a way to make it lower cost though, so that could just be a particular characteristic about him.

 First victim of what? Biri's death is not part of the al-Aqsa Intifada because the intifada started after his death - after Ariel Sharon's visit to the al-Aqsa site. You see, that's how it got the name """"al-Aqsa"""". The Israeli government propaganda repeated at the websites you list claims that the Palestinians started the al-Aqsa intifada before Sharon even visited the al-Aqsa site. Even the """"Palestine Facts"""" source you cite and the objective Mitchell report point to Sharon's visit as the trigger for the al-Aqsa intifada. Of course there is constant violence in the area so anyone can name his own start date. We can go back to 1948 or 1917 if you want. It does no service to Wikipedia to throw Israeli government propaganda into the article. ( I am sure that won't stop you though).    
""""Also on September 28, 2000, Ariel Sharon visited the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. This visit became the pretext for instigating large scale demonstrations, the start of the al-Aqsa infifada.""""  

""""On September 28, 2000, Ariel Sharon marched defiantly and provocatively through the Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, touching off the current round of violence. """"   

The Mitchell Report:
""""Mr. Sharon made the visit on September 28 accompanied by over 1,000 Israeli police officers. Although Israelis viewed the visit in an internal political context, Palestinians saw it as highly provocative to them. On the following day, in the same place, a large number of unarmed Palestinian demonstrators and a large Israeli police contingent confronted each other. According to the U.S. Department of State, """"Palestinians held large demonstrations and threw stones at police in the vicinity of the Western Wall. Police used rubber-coated metal bullets and live ammunition to disperse the demonstrators, killing 4 persons and injuring about 200.""""[4] According to the GOI, 14 Israeli policemen were injured.[5] Similar demonstrations took place over the following several days.[6] Thus began what has become known as the """"Al-Aqsa Intifada"""" (Al-Aqsa being a mosque at the Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount). """"  

Furthermore, in the article Terrorism_against_Israel_in_2000#August, it says Biri died in August after being attacked by """"terrorists"""". (If Biri was an Israeli soldier in occupied Gaza, why are his attackers called """"terrorists"""" in Wikipedia?). You need to sort out your Israeli propaganda to at least get the dates and descriptors right. 
""""* August 27: Terrorists attack a group of vehicles traveling to Netzarim with two roadside bombs and automatic gunfire.  David Biri, age 19, is wounded.
 August 28: David Biri dies of wounds suffered in a Palestinian terrorist attack the previous day.
 September 29: Border policeman Chief Inspector Yossi Tabaji, 27, of Ramle, killed and a second Israeli border policeman wounded by a Palestinian Authority policeman on a joint patrol near Kalkiliya District Coordinating Office. """"
Yossi Tabaji and several unnamed Palestinian youth were also killed in the days before the """"official start"""" of the al-Aqsa intifada because there are constant killings almost every day in the conflict. The al-Aqsa intifada is an upsurge in the violence that started after Sharon's visit to the al-Aqsa site. That is the commonly understood definition of al-Aqsa intifada. Adding stories about Israeli deaths that happened the day before is just Israeli government propaganda to deflect blame away from Ariel Sharon.  19:00, 20 Dec 2004 (UTC)""",0.0

"A classic BWilkins block, with all the familiar traits to experienced observers - brevity, arrogance and ultimately, ineffectiveness. In true BWilkins style though, someone else has to take his nonsense blocks to their inevitable conclusion . So take your bow Reaper Eternal, there's a good lad.

So here goes, BWilkins presumably blocked me because he thought I was about to OUT someone, yet in his incompetence failed to lock this page, so.....drum roll......User:Mo ainm used to be User:BigDunc, the account that 'retired' and never went back to editting the same articles, pulling the same stunts, or so the public record would have you believe.

Yes, that's the super secret information that the esteemed *arbitrator* Elen of the Roads thinks should be permanently stricken from the record, even though he's now the very conspicuous last man standing of a clique of Irish Republican editors who have been skewing Wikipedia articles for YEARS using the same despicable tactics, and are only now starting to be noticed by the sloths who work AE and be dealt with as appropriate (or 'retire' as they see the wriitng on the wall for their hard won 'reputations' as editors in 'good standing' who never got noticed by the dumbshits who are supposed to monitor editors for compliance with all policies, not just the easy ones).

Mo survives due in no small part to the fact that none of his mates ever had the good fortune of getting away with a mid-life secret change of identity, as well as the general cowardice of people like BWilkins, who usually run a mile rather than deal with something complex like GAMEing on Irish republican related articles. Nope, that's far too much like work for that lazy prick.

This change of identity is being covered up by Elen on the grounds of OUTing. Yes, that's right, Elen wants to stake her reputation on a patently ridiculous claim that knowing that Mo ainm is really a bloke called Duncan who lives in Ireland, is a violation of WP:OUTING, just to cover up the fact that she never bothered to verify whether this was 100% grade A bullshit before she started blocking people for calling it as such, those who were there at the beginning and know just exactly how this lucky cunt came to have this excuse land in his lap and save him from a complete FAIL in understanding what is and is not a CLEANSTART.

So here we are, with sponge brained morons like Reaper and detestible assholes like BWilkins continuing the farce with blocks and censures like this. So well done guys. Assuming neither of you has the backbone to do the necessary and end this farce once and for all by calling Elen out on her lies, one of you has to now ensure this post gets oversighted so she can continue this OUTing bullshit story of hers to cover her own incompetent deceitful ass.

 The Aurora name 

One of the parts of the story that seemed particularly weak was the name. """"Aurora"""" was selected because it appeared as a line item in a budget document. I am currently reading a National Academy of Sciences report called """"Review of the Department of Energy’s Inertial Confinement Fusion Program"""", which was published in September 1990. The paper discusses a variety of issues relating to controlled fusion experiments, and led indirectly to the current National Ignition Facility efforts. Why do I mention this? Well on the very first page I found:

...and a subsequent meeting was held in La Jolla on August 21, 1990, to consider future experiments possible with the AURORA facility.

Aurora was a high-power KrF ICF laser built at Los Alamos. Given the time frame, the general secrecy surrounding these machines, and the common name, is there any chance the line item in question was the budget for this laser?

 2012 in UFC events 

When the situation calms down (or even before then if you want), would you be willing to do a peer review of 2012 in UFC events?  You aren't heavily involved in MMA articles and have only gotten involved though AfDs of various articles.  If this concept is going to be continued to full year articles (2012 in mixed martial arts) and for past years, I'd be interested in hearing from a somewhat uninvolved person how the articles could be further improved on.    
I will do what I can.  I have commented in a few places with the goal of opening a few minds, but there are many who simply hate change, so it will take some time and patience.  I don't have an exact picture in my head of how it should be done, but I do think you and Mtking are moving the right direction, in spite of a lot of close minded opposition.    
Hey Dennis, you like the rule book right? Well, here you go! WP:NOTBUREAUCRACY
WP:IGNORE   
What you are doing it cherry picking sentences that fit your desires, not understanding the policies as a whole.  I can't fix that, only you can.    

 Excellently written 

This is excellently written, much better than I could have done. If people will listen is another story, but let's not go there. I personally would have linked moved forward without you to WP:5THWHEEL , but that might be a little harsh (or not). Well done. (bainuu)  
I've posted in a few places, a bit of a velvet hammer, if you will.  I don't contribute content to MMA, and I'm hoping that that some people will listen simply because I'm objective, an old timer here and not an admin.  Most won't, but change will be easier if we can change the momentum from negative, to contributory, of a few people at a timer.    
I think it is what was needed, that and your follow up. I'm not an MMA person myself (not since I watched UFC 1 on an illegal PPV box shhhhh). Everyone finds change difficult, on and off wiki, I think you've done a great service with your comments, heeded or not. (bainuu)

 2012 UFC events 

Alright I did some work on it. How's the page looking so far? Any suggestions?   
I'm no expert, but it seems to be shaping up nicely.  Keep in mind that it may change in format several times before it is all said and done, so don't get too attached to any one way of doing things.  Just keep a cool head and talk about it on the talk page.  Sometimes several ways are tried, and they end up going back to the first way.  It is all part of the process.  As you may or may not have noticed, I don't actually contribute to the content on the articles anyway, my function here is mainly to help the transition go more smoothly and help people understand the reasons for the changes.  You know 100x more about MMA than I will ever know, so there isn't much I can do to help you with the actual content.  Your positive attitude toward the changes is very much appreciated.    
Yea I expect more changes, hopefully a name change from """"2012 in UFC events"""" to """"UFC events in 2012"""" will happen, because right now it's having trouble being listed on search engines.  ([[User talk:Glock1",0.0

"UPittIT Block 

Hi Orangemike,

Hope you are doing well and I appreciate your work here on Wikipedia. I have some questions regarding the block of UPittIT. Although I too have some concerns with this account which primarily are the lack of this editor's responsiveness to numerous warnings of copyright concerns (as Hammersoft had pointed out), and editor's lack of engagement in dialogue regarding these issues. This could be simple misunderstanding of the copyright policy for the editor's user space, but the repeated violations are disconcerting. In fact, I can't be entirely sure that the user account is only one person (a kind of reverse sockpuppetry that makes me uneasy). However, it is my understanding that editors are not in WP:COI solely due to their place of employment or username, but rather because of the issues of POV, reliability and neutrality of their contributions. However, in this case, my particular my concern is the work the editor had done in his or her own sandbox (the now deleted  issues, this had not been demonstrated because all of his/her work (as far as I know) had been confined his/hers user sandbox. The editor was an obvious newbie, and had twice sought feedback (see here and here) and had been responsive to suggestions demonstrated by the removal of pervasive external links, downsizing of the article, rewriting so it was not in violation of WP:NOTDIR, and the addition of outside, neutral third-party references. In fact, although I did not see any of the editor's additions to this particular article since July 7th, in my opinion, it contained useful information, was notable, and was ready to be moved from the user space into Wikipedia proper. Mostly, I would request that this page be restored, as I would like to create that particular article myself and will not be able to duplicate the off-line references from various library science journals that had been inserted. I guess you could say that I primarily lament the loss of this particular article. I would appreciate your thoughts on this issue, and your review of the D-Scribe Digital Publishing article circa the July 7th version as I would like to see if there is anything salvageable from that (sans the copyright violations that Hammersoft elucidated).

jftr, what the above refers to

Former MPs do have working links in Parliament. If you weren't so eager to smash things rather than fix them, you would have noticed that. And you couldn't even be bothered to let me know there might be a problem. I hope our paths never cross again but I suppose I'll have to watch your contributions in future to make sure you aren't deleting everything I do. What a waste of time. Oh yeah - I'll assume you were smashing in good faith. As if. Thanks for ruining my (formerly) good mood, as I was enjoying making some useful contributions to Wikipedia articles.   
Welcome to Wikipedia. Now, a recap. With this edit you added a link to the current MPs list, for Carter. Problem was it was for David Carter, not John Carter so I removed it. I went to replace it with one for John Carter, but there is none, so I couldn't. You then added another link, but like the first one it too went to the wrong person, this time, Cam Calder. I removed it with the edit summary """"Cannot replace it because Carter is no longer an mp"""". You have responded by inserting a brand new link to Former MPs. I was unaware Carter has been added to that list, but that is beside the point because I was removing links to current MPs. If you intend to edit Wikipedia for a while I suggest you don't shout in your edit summaries as you did with """"Former MPs DO HAVE WORKING LINKS. Wikipedians fix links rather than delete them"""",  and you address the actual issue and don't jump to conclusions.   
Not true! The actual issue was that you deleted ALL the links I added for him. That is the recap. The two other links worked fine, but you deleted them as well in your hurry to smash everything someone else did. In other words, you are the one who jumped to conclusions. Now you're trying to claim you only deleted the one that was a problem. Even your edit summary is wrong. The man's resignation was presented the same day I was adding the links, unknown to me, so it seems the Parliament link was being moved from current to former which caused pointer problems when I clicked on it. Things happen. It only needed to be fixed. I would have thought an Admin would be capable of figuring that out. Nor could you figure out how to leave a message on my Talk page so I could figure it out. You just couldn't wait to smash everything. I only came back to the article because I was going through the non-Cabinet people on the list. Did you fix that list, once you realized this was a former MP? No, you did not. That would have been """"work"""", requiring """"thought"""" and """"effort"""". Same as you mis-corrected the hat note on the other John Carter MP. Based on your arrogance, I thought it likely you were an Admin. What a surprise, I was right. And Jimbo wonders why the numbers of actual contributors are going straight downhill. I have NO intention of continuing to contribute to Wikipedia because you obviously would prefer to do everything yourself. You're not at all welcoming, helpful, polite, assuming good faith, or anything else I was led to believe is part of the Wikipedia ethos. So I leave you to it. You didn't even have the grace to apologize for deleting the other links, you just tried to blame me in this audit trail. Go lecture someone else, because I'm out of here, and you can be sure I won't be encouraging anyone else to participate in what could have been a good project. Your attitude is horrendous, and I'm sure I'm not the first one you've chased out of here. Well, keep it up and you'll soon have the whole thing to yourself. Enjoy.

How references work

 Simple references 

These require two parts;

a)
Chzz is 98 years old. """"The book of Chzz"""", Aardvark Books, 2009. 

He likes tea.  [http://www.nicecupofteaandasitdown.com Tea website] 

b) A section called """"References"""" with the special code """"{{reflist}}"""";
== References ==
{{reflist}}

(an existing article is likely to already have one of these sections)

To see the result of that, please look at user:chzz/demo/simpleref. Edit it, and check the code; perhaps make a test page of your own, such as user:/reftest and try it out.

 Named references 

Chzz was born in 1837. 
""""The book of Chzz"""", Aardvark Books, 2009. 
 

Chzz lives in Footown.

Note that the second usage has a / (and no closing ref tag). This needs a reference section as above; please see user:chzz/demo/namedref to see the result.

 Citation templates 

You can put anything you like between  and , but using citation templates makes for a neat, consistent look;

Chzz has 37 Olympic medals.  {{Citation
 | last = Smith
 | first = John
 | title = Olympic medal winners of the 20th century
 | publication-date = 2001

"Smalley's postion on these matters is essentially the same in his most recent work - he is still writing on the subject.  Moreover, Smalley's perception is also that of many other leading authorities on the Gospels in the early church; such as [[Christopher Rowland (theologian)|Christopher Rowland), who may not (unlike Smalley), be specialists in the Johannine literature.  The pespectives reperesented in the article as it is currently, represent (to my reading) one particular strand of the 'redaction critical' approach.  Broadly, this approach shares with Smalley/Rowland, a decreased tendency to regard the Synoptic Gospels as transmitting a 'historical' source.  But the corollary is to treat both the gospel genre; and much of the charactersistic gospel content; as a theological construct - specifically due to the author of Mark.  But if Mark 'invented' the feeding in the wilderness as a theological construct, then the presence of the same story in John shows dependence.  But this view of Mark is not by any means a consensus; many scholars (like Smalley and Rowland) would maintain that there were indeed independent 'historical' accounts of Jesus's ministry and gospel message that preceded both the Synpoptics and John, and provided the basis for their common narrative material.

2.  Gwen Gale is not informed about the “Death of Adolf Hitler”.

She continues to use Bezymenski, a 1968 admitted fraud, as a source over numerous other authors.

3.  Any time anyone will keep Gwen Gale away from “Death of Adolf Hitler”, serious scholars will fix it and get stars or whatever, Wiki will be accurate, and proud.

"Separation of personal life from main 'eras' section 
The separation of Michael's personal life info from the main 'eras' section is going too far with this categorization thing which seems to have swept up the article recently. Introducing an 'influence' section was alright, as that didn't take from the main body, the chronological section, of the article. But taking out things deemed 'personal' and plonking them neatly under four different areas just doesn't flow well. It junts the reader in and out of various years, and just doesn't work. Before, the article was chronological, and a certain degree of chronology is good in a biographical article. Let me clear up one thing: the eras don't just mean what was related to the ALBUM of the era. The eras are simply a convenient way of splitting up Michael's life into nice sections. We don't need to FURTHER split the article up. I think that we should put personal stuff back into the main chronological bit, as people seem to have misinterpreted what the 'eras' are meant to be. His career and his personal life should go together. For example, the Oprah Interview, once aired, significantly increased sales of Dangerous. That link cannot be neatly established if the two 'bits' (for lack of a better word) are separated. I am trying to reach a new consensus to have the personal stuff put back into the main body, as right not the article seems to be a skeleton of subheadings. The eras are tiny, and any reader will be confused by the layout, which isn't chronological. So that's why I'm trying to reach a new consensus: To put the personal life information back into the chronological part of the article.",0.0

One such example is from Hardcore punk band The Dead Kennedys artwork for the back cover of their album Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death. The picture depicts a mock version of the original photo, with the American flag replaced by a Coca-Cola flag. The re-interpretation of this famous image signifes the band's ideology and belief in the evils of the corporatizing of America and the world.

"OVERVIEW:

Crunch (AGT Crunch Acquisition, LLC) is a fitness-based enterprise that is focused on making entertainment an integral part of the exercise experience. Established in New York in 1989, today the Crunch brand has 27 locations in 7 major urban centers in the United States: New York City, Brooklyn, Atlanta, Chicago, Miami, San Francisco and Los Angeles. As a strategy, Crunch has concentrated on expanding inside of these urban centers: its penchant for innovation resonating especially well with the various demographics therein.  Because of these factors the brand is often associated with descriptors such as “hip”, “edgy”, “urban” etc. and has an air of inherent coolness that the majority of its competitors cannot claim to.

FEATURES:

1)TABGROUP FITNESS CLASSES
Since its inception Crunch has maintained a focus on its group fitness program as the brand’s cornerstone. As such, it has built an extensive catalogue of classes that are characterized by their broad appeal and inventiveness. Numbering in the hundreds, these classes are organized into three different categories: Action Sports, Chill Outs and Dance Rhythms. Examples (taken from the official Crunch website) include:
Urbanathlete (Action Sports)
This circuit-style class is based on Men’s Health Magazine’s Fitness Challenge.  In it you’ll work through obstacles and exercises that were inspired by various cityscapes and come to see just about any sprawling metropolis as a big, concrete playground. 

Antigravity Yoga ‘Wings’ (Chill Outs)
Wings’ will have you stretching further and holding challenging poses longer, using only a fabric trapeze to do so.  And, by employing simple suspension techniques you’ll move into poses that are seemingly impossible.  However, the goal isn’t just to turn you into a human pretzel: those poses will help to relieve compressed joints and align your body from head to toe.

Cardio Dance Blast (Dance Rhythms)
Get your groove on in this sixty-minute class that’s been cleverly disguised as a dance party – one with a soundtrack comprised of the best in hip-hop, reggae and top-forty music.  You’ll melt away fat while bringing your dance skills to the next level and beyond.
In addition, Crunch offers private versions of their classes for small groups.

2)TABPERSONAL TRAINING
Each Crunch location has a staff of personal trainers available to its members for individual or semi-private sessions. Crunch divides these personal trainers into four different categories based on experience and certifications earned. (All of Crunch’s personal trainers are required to have a minimum of professional experience and certifications earned prior to being hired.) Collectively, these trainers have expertise in a broad range of areas. Quoting from the company’s press kit, “All Crunch clubs are staffed with first-rate fitness professionals – personal trainers with certifications in a wide variety of specialties: strength training, yoga, boxing, kickboxing, pre/post natal, kettle bells, physical rehabilitation and much more.”

3) EQUIPMENT
All Crunch locations feature a wide array of fitness equipment produced by the industry’s leading manufacturers: Precor, Life Fitness, Netpulse, Expresso, Icarian, Hammer Strength etc. This equipment is updated with an eye toward keeping current with emerging technologies and trends. For example Crunch is phasing in Life Fitness’ treadmills with built-in iPod functionality. Select Crunch locations in New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles feature Pilates studios equipped with both Reformers and Wunda Chair Systems and locations in all markets feature Yoga studios. Additionally, certain facilities have more elaborate features: full-sized boxing rings, swimming pools, indoor tracks, basketball courts, saunas, hot tubs and sundecks.  

4) SPECIAL EVENTS AND UNIQUE OFFERINGS
The following is taken from Crunch’s current press kit regarding special events and unique offerings: 


Crunch health clubs are home to a unique fusion of entertainment and fitness, one that we have pioneered from our inception and continue to explore through a number of different channels. In-gym parties and performances (by students of Scratch DJ Academy), an outdoor summer concert series, partnerships with cutting-edge theatrical productions like Spiegelworld and Fuerzabruta and our Broadway Dance Series are all hallmarks of this exploration. Additionally, we’ve developed a number of events that take place outside of our gyms, like field trips (which are held year-round in all of our markets and vary greatly in destination) a",0.0

No, Caspian, it is you and your mode of operation that is transparent.

That is the big problem with dealing with Caspian ... if anyone documents what THEY (Caspian blue) do, e.g. create noise as a distraction, they will turn around and use it in their next layer of attack attempting to draw attention away from them.

The prejudicial error in using Google as an arbitrator in a situation like this is that any search for 'Yonsei' will also bring results for 'Yonsei University' etc as a partial search results. 

Using it properly, e.g. search for Yonsei minus the word university  provides a far more accurate result for its usage.

 Korean articles

Hi, I noticed you were taking part in the discussion on the Talk:Hwang Seong-gyeong page. I think Bethereds behaviour is ridiculous and something needs to be done to stop his ownership of these pages. He said that he would """"change the pages back until the end of time"""" as he thinks he is right in removing any Japanese reference from """"his"""" Korean pages. There are many reasons why Japanese katakana should be included in these pages (the obvious being that the characters are created by a Japanese company and that every other article includes it bar the few Korean characters). Is there any way to call a moderator or administrator to this debate to stop Bethereds reverts? He seems to have no proper reason as to why he is omitting the information other than he believes Korea is better than Japan (I've read his user page and looked at his previous edits and he seems to be doing anything he can to promote Korea over Japan). Does he not realise that in these games, even Chang and Kim (from KOF) speak in the Japanese language and have never even uttered a Korean word? We need a vote or something to put him right. Thanks.

On the September 26, 2007, radio broadcast of The Rush Limbaugh Show, Limbaugh received telephone calls from two listeners regarding the Iraq War. The first caller, """"Mike in Chicago"""", who identified himself as a Republican and former service member, told Limbaugh, """"I do believe that we should pull out of Iraq."""" Limbaugh argued with the caller and ended up treating him dismissively.  After that call, Limbaugh next spoke to a listener who wanted to """"retort to Mike in Chicago"""" (the original caller).  This second caller, who identified himself as a soldier,  complained that the media never talked to """"real soldiers"""" like himself.  He was clearly responding directly to the first caller, who had told Limbaugh he felt the Iraq War was a mistake.  The current version of the article only contains the conversation with the second caller.  It doesn't make it clear that the second caller's remarks are in response to """"Mike in Chicago""""'s anti-war comments.  This second caller never mentioned Jesse Macbeth at all.  With the addition of the first conversation, the New York Times response that Limbaugh's """"phony soldiers"""" comment was """"referring to Iraq war veterans critical of the war"""" makes sense.  As is, this article is heavily skewed in favor of Limbaugh.  Both sides of the controversy need to be presented.  Right now, this article is simply a Limbaugh-fanatic's wet dream.- """,0.0

Simmons does not write classic """"hard science"""" science fiction like the old masters Asimov, Clarke and Heinlein.  Instead he writes a form of grandiose social SF which is sometimes related to the social SF or Soft science fiction tradition of Bradbury, Le Guin, Vance and others.  I wanted to do fast justice to his continuation, in his own very particular style, of that tradition by making a rapid allusion to the fact that his literary approach is really not space opera. Well, yes that """"justice"""" was too fast and I am correctng it! By the way it is customary to add messages at the _bottom_ of somebody's talk page, and not at the top like you did.

I agree that it's a contentious statement, but don't you see that it's equally contentious to assert that I """"clearly"""" acted in ways which were at best likely to mislead others? I'm under no obligation (that I'm aware of) to explicitly call out that the various IP addresses I use are all being used by me. That said, I've also never denied it. Frankly, no one has seemed to have a problem figuring it out, so I'm not sure anyone's been seriously mislead to begin with. I'm not hiding my writing style or anything.
E.g. 
My use of wikipedia being my *reading* use, as is made clear by the statement """"those orange banners are annoying."""" I didn't evade the block until such point when I thought it had been communicated that editing under a different IP wouldn't be considered evasion. As User:Dennis Brown pointed out to me, IP addresses aren't humans; they're more akin to telephone numbers. It follows that a block applied to a telephone number applies to that telephone number. If the intention was to stop me, personally, from editing Wikipedia, shouldn't it have been a ban? (Also, you must be aware that statements like """"to twist logic in your defense"""" fail to AGF.)
At this point, I'm pretty sure that everyone has taken it as granted that I'm being deceptive simply by choosing not to register for an account. If that's the case, this really doesn't seem like the encyclopedia that anyone is encouraged to edit boldly. Also, you're misconstruing what I admitted (see above.)
Lastly, (and this relates to all of your points in general), you yourself said that it was reasonable to invoke IAR (above) in order to improve Wikipedia, despite the block. If that was the case for calling attention to a bad edit, why not a bad policy?

I am a professional photographer - I was paid both by Martin Cilia & The Atlantics to take those photos and they requested that they go up onto Wikipedia to replace the outdated ones. I own the copyright. I guess it's kind of flattering that my photos appear too professional to be my own work -) I'm happy to supply original files with EXIF info if needed. Should I put in a request, or just leave it for you to handle? 
She went on to provide all these ways of contacting her and I do know her well enough she was the first photographer I contacted back in 2007 who was very generous with allowing the Wikipedia to display many of her recent photos. She lives in Australia.

Espionage or a dick spying on some pussy lovers involves an individual obtaining information that is considered secret or confidential without the permission of the holder of the information. Espionage is inherently clandestine, as the legitimate holder of the information may change plans or take other countermeasures once it is known that the information is in unauthorized hands. See clandestine HUMINT for the basic concepts of such information collection, and subordinate articles such as clandestine HUMINT operational techniques and clandestine HUMINT asset recruiting for discussions of the """"tradecraft"""" used to collect this information.
Hey I gotta joke and it goes like this:Dick says """"Hey Balls get ready for a patry"""" Balls replies """"You fucking liar. Everytime we go to a party, you always go in and leave us out here knockin.  

History
Incidents of espionage are well documented throughout history. The ancient writings of Chinese and Indian military strategists such as Sun-Tzu and Chanakya contain information on deception and subversion. Chanakya's student Chandragupta Maurya, founder of the Maurya Empire, made use of assassinations, spies and secret agents, which are described in Chanakya's Arthasastra. The ancient Egyptians had a thoroughly developed system for the acquisition of intelligence, and the Hebrews used spies as well, as in the story of Rahab. Feudal Japan often used ninja to gather intelligence. More recently, spies played a significant part in Elizabethan England (see Francis Walsingham). Many modern espionage methods were well established even then. http://www.henrywotton.org.uk/

The Cold War involved intense espionage activity between the United States of America and its allies and the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China and their allies, particularly related to nuclear weapons secrets. Recently, espionage agencies have targeted the illegal drug trade and those considered to be terrorists.

Different intelligence services value certain  intelligence collection techniques over others. The former Soviet Union, for example, preferred  human sources over  research in open sources, while the United States has tended to emphasize technological methods such as SIGINT and IMINT. Both Soviet political (KGB) and military intelligence (GRU
 ) officers were judged by the number of agents they recruited. 

Various Forms
Unlike other forms of  intelligence collection disciplines, espionage usually involves accessing the place where the desired information is stored, or accessing the people who know the information and will divulge it through some kind of subterfuge. There are exceptions to physical meetings, such as the Oslo Report, or the insistence of Robert Hanssen in never meeting the people to whom he was selling information.

The US defines espionage towards itself as """"The act of obtaining, delivering, transmitting, communicating, or receiving information about the national defense with an intent, or reason to believe, that the information may be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation. Espionage is a violation of 18 United States Code 792-798 and Article 106, Uniform Code of Military Justice{{cite web

 POV  talk section moved 

POV

i've tried to clean things up a bit though someone else will have to remove the vandalistically applied christianity template lest i be reported for """"edit warring"""" by humus.   i've added a link to the christianity and judaism portals in the """"see also"""" section.   these links are more fitting than claiming this is """"part of the series on christianity""""

this article was very heavy on anti-jfj stuff.  a lengthy """"criticism"""" section as well as criticisms inserted into nearly every other section.  the missionaries are """"taught to speak in hebrew"""" (these people already went to hebrew school!) and jfj is known to """"target vulnerable jews"""" (oh really?) and """"most of the funding comes from christians"""" (well did we think it was coming from muslims and religious jews?) and the current leader """"is not jewish"""" (even though his mother, father, all grandparents were apparently jewish)

some of the criticisms' references were just opinion pieces from religious jews who oppose conversion.  most come from biased publications that don't meet wikipedia's reliable sources standards.  including these references is analogous to editing the """"buddhism"""" article to say that """"all buddhists will burn in hell"""" along with a reference to some fire-n-brimstone website.

anyway, if all we're trying to get across is that some, even many, jewish people and groups oppose jfj we don't need to spread it all over the article.  it isn't at all surprising that religious jews don't want other jews to accept jesus  every missionary movement is opposed by someone.

 

Friend, your edits pushed your delusion that J4J is just another Jewish denomination that a bunch of long-bearded Hassidim oppose. You don't seem to comprehend how the group ruffles feathers throughout the whole length and breadth of the Jewish community even among commies and even among a lot of Christians, as it is contrary to the spirit of modern ecumenicism. J4J is as much defined by the hostility to it as anything else. That is the state of play. I think that you can make a case if you feel the wording is not neutral, but you can't water down the unanimous opposition to J4J and call that """"NPOV"""" 

Thanks for the """"friend"""", nice words are always welcome, even though the rest is not.   Please don't accuse me of """"pushing my delusions"""".   Some jewish groups may strongly oppose them, but there's no way to show that """"all"""" """"mainstream"""" jewish groups, including """"secular"""" groups """"strongly"""" oppose them, without taking the liberty of defining who """"all"""" the """"mainstream"""" jewish groups are, and what degree of """"opposition"""" is """"strong"""".  Can you really not see this simple truth?
Beyond that it just isn't appropriate to overwhelm this article with criticism.  I outlined this above already.   Statements like j4j approachs """"vulnerable jews"""" are unabashedly POV  and tautological.  If anyone converts then its clear they were """"vulnerable"""" to conversion,  so if anyone approached converts, then j4j has approaches """"vulnerable jews"""".
It's not in question that all missionary groups are converting someone from some belief system to another, but it is only barely notable that someone opposes this conversion.  Does McDonald's oppose Burger King and try to put them out of business at every turn?  Yes...but who cares?  Do drug smugglers """"strongly oppose"""" DEA agents coming along and busting up their operations?   Yes...but it would be silly to put it in an article.   Everyone has opposition and it just goes without saying.   Still, I wouldn't be """"strongly opposed"""" to his article having a section on opposition, but nearly every corner of this article is littered with criticism that is all essentially the same.
Compare this article to that of any other missionary group.   In the article """"christianity"""" is there a section labeled """"incompatibility with paganism"""" and """"a belief that is incompatible with paganism"""" and """"all pagan groups strongly oppose christianity""""?   Do we see """"incompatibility with catholicism"""" in the protestant article?   I know this analogy is not going to be satisfying, but no analogy is ever complete.
What are the further objections?   Yes, the group may be called """"Jews for Jesus"""" and that offends people, but what would you have them call themselves?   Would """"Jews that are now christians but still consider themselves jewish"""" be better?  They did use Jackie Mason in a pamphlet.   They also used Steve Jobs and Curious George, and a whole bunch of others, but i don't see Steve Jobs supporters here furious about Jews for jesus """"deceiving"""" ipod owners into believing in jesus.

 Arbitrary omission of """"See also"""" reference to One-hitter (smoking)

Revision as of 20:43, 22 June 2011 (view source)Mjpresson (talk | contribs) (→See also: the ol' one-hitter...RIP)

This is one of over a half dozen deletions of """"See also"""" references to the One-hitter (smoking) article from various other articles, as if intending to isolate that article from readers and steer them toward joint-smoking instead.  Note the apparently taunting editing statement.  

The same editor has repeatedly deleted from cannabis articles, including this one, (a) photos of small-dosage inhalant utensils which, properly operated, mostly vaporize rather than burn cannabinoids as compared with combustion-based """"joint"""" smoking; (b) the Australian Department of Health warning against mixing with tobacco which can lead to """"unintended nicotine addiction"""" (this """"traditional"""" mixture is considered a prevalent meaning of the word """"joint"""" in Europe and some other places, and children investigating cannabis get drawn into a life-shortening habit that has nothing to do with cannabis); (c) any references to articles on wikiHow.com which accurately describe how to make one's own dosage moderation utensils; (d) any possible text describing safer, more economical procedures of cannabis consumption than hot burning cigarette papers.  (Not surprisingly the same editor, quoted above, has prosecuted this writer on Administrators' Noticeboard/Incidents for attempting to introduce such information.)

Admittedly there is a shortage of really clear, descriptive photos of one-hitter utensils available from WikiCommons, and the ones used until now, here and on articles like Cannabis smoking and One-hitter (smoking), were not ideal.  Editors are urged to find and supply illustrations that show (a) a really small crater 5.5 mm is best; (b) a long flexible drawtube so users can see what they are doing during the lighting process and get more vaporization, less combustion.

The promise inherent in the title """"Cannabis consumption"""" includes a duty to inform Wikipedia readers of utensils which (a) are cheaper in initial cost than a plug-in electric vaporizer, though the latter is best; (b) are safer to use and less wasteful of extremely expensive herbal material  than cigarette paper; (c) can be made locally """"in your garage"""" rather than purchased from monopoly corporations like Tops and Bugler; (d) can be used without adding tobacco (""""Toke pure""""), thus avoiding risk of """"unintended nicotine addiction"""".

 Categories 

As per WP:RDR#Categories for redirect pages and Wikipedia:Categorizing redirects it seems some categorization aside from """"Type of redirect"""" is allowed.

In this case, the categories are to allow ease of navigation for readers using the categories to find specific things.

2007 in comics is especially pertinent since it only apples to a subsection of the target article and it would be misleading to apply to the article as a whole.

DC Comics storylines and Superhero comics it is an issue of completeness - using those as a navigation aid to find specific title is easier if the title is there, even if it is a redirect.

Even if they would be able to see the same spectrum as us, it remains doubtful if those images will mean anything to them at first glance. However, the point here is to convey information. While we can look at a picture at all wavelengths, it is only in the visible spectrum that information on this picture (patterns and variations) start to appear (at other wavelengths, its blank). An analogy would be satellites using SARs to pierce the cloud cover of Venus and image its surface.   There is little information in the visible spectrum but lots outside of it. If the information is encoded in a digital form (eg: RGB) rather than displayed using our technology, then they will interpret it in colors they can see as this encoding is not relative to a specific spectrum. Still, they should be able to figure out what king of colors we meant to encode in the first place by looking at the probes themselves and the markings on them. I think that the aliens will be able to make sense of this information easily. Regardless, I completely agree with you. It will take them years to analyze what we have sent them and make sense of it (ie: convert it to something they can relate to), but if they feel as lonely as us, then I trust that they will invest the resources and time.",0.0

 Error becoming acceptable 

The most common error that I see regarding the use or misuse of the plural noun is the use of the word """"emails."""" Email, meaning electronic mail, is both singular and plural. Someone may receive one piece of mail (email) or many pieces of mail (email). Since it would be incorrect to say, """"I received lots of """"mails"""", it is just as incorrect to say, """"I received lots of """"emails."""" 

The problem I see with this is that the use of """"emails"""" has spawned a growing acceptance of the misuse of plural nouns in general. It is amazing to see in both the written and spoken word, how educated people increasingly misuse the plural noun.  

For example; take some time, on any given day, and listen to the dribble that comes out of the mouths of news reporters. It is atrocious what you will hear when you are paying attention.

I wonder where it will end?

 Misleading reference to study? 

In the section on lead paint in art (which I largely wrote), someone added the following:

""""Lead paint will often become discolored over long periods of time. This is due to the reaction of the lead carbonate in the paint with traces of hydrogen sulfide in the air and with acids, often from fingerprints. [2] As a result, many older works of art that used lead paint now show some discoloration.""""

As I found this surprising, I went and carefully read the study being cited. Their research seemed to refer only to lead in aqueous media on paper, although that wasn't absolutely clear. But lead paint is almost never used that way! Artists working in transparent watercolor (aquarelle) don't usually use white paint, or just occasionally a bit of """"Chinese White"""" (not lead) to make corrections. And opaque watercolors (gouache) and acrylic (polymer) artist's paints typically use titanium dioxide or (rarely) zinc white, but never lead. Normally """"flake white"""" is used only by oil painters, and there's no indication in the study that they were referring to oil paints. Cooperstown is a well-respected institution, but as of now I'm sticking with the classic (Ralph Mayer). Flake white may get *slightly* yellowish after centuries, but nothing like the gross discoloration referred to in the paragraph above. If someone has more information on this, please mention it here; otherwise when I come back I'm going to delete that paragraph or water it down (no pun intended).""",0.0

The reality was that the communist Khmer Rouge leadership ran the whole operation, as they showed at once when they came to power. Because Ruy Lopez is a communist and an apologist for the Khmer Rouge, he seeks to impose a completely false view of these organisations on the article.

I for one think the Greeks have had one of their great patriotic moments unjustly marketed to ignorant teenagers, like a cheap McDonald's burger. And worse, the Persians were outrightly denied their humanity. Let's for one second assume that the point-of-view indeed is """"Spartan"""". So what? If the purported """"Spartan"""" point-of-view is perverse, biased, untruthful, racist (If not outrighly inhuman considering a great deal of Persians in the film were depicted in a number of bizarre ways that would rather go under the sub-human category) and full of flaws... Why the fuck invest over 60 million dollars in a Hollywood production and try to find a market and an audience to bolster this bizarre concept? It just goes to show that profit is made on someone else's expense, while everything could legally be peddled as """"art"""" or """"entertainment"""" while making a buck out of it. Seems like the perfect backdoor in avoiding charges of libel and defamation.

In fact, how about someone makes a collage of Zack Snyder and Frank Miller in photoshopped pictures performing fellatio and label it art? Libel, anyone? Defamation? If art is free, then certainly the wind may and must blow in all directions, just as much as a coin may have two sides. After all, through the argument of """"point of view"""", anything could be distributed as art. And why stop there? A sequel entailing their mothers could be appropriate, considering that the new best friends Snyder and Miller have confirmed a sequel.

Bohr's Philosophy
Hello and thanks for your critique on my slight, though important changes to the article. I'd like to comment that previous to my changes, the particular part was absolute horrible writing, strictly from a stylistic point of of view, while my changes morphed that into a well balanced, clean structure that semantically integrated into the overall flow of the previous text. Furthermore, your deletion, based on arguable and vague stylistic opinion while ignoring a more important semantic correction—without which many are misled to believe that Bohr was an atheist unarguably—makes you appear to have done it in an attempt of an ideological censorship. Although I'm sure you have had no such intentions, your removal of only one side of the story points directly to your own dogmas on the subject.

As someone who, I believe, appreciates freedom of speech and honest representation of views in Wikipedia, you can understand my arguments. If you wish to discuss the style of the change, I'm more than open to discuss it with you, but I think your fine reputation ought to prevent you from silently deleting it in the future. Therefore, relying on it, I'm reposting the correction, which we can later collaboratively polish to your liking.

Finally, as we are on the subject, I have done an extensive search, and to my knowledge Bohr never called himself an atheist, and the references for this statement """"Bohr's disagreements with the philosopher mostly stemmed from Bohr's atheism"""" seem completely unsupportive of the thesis—statements by anybody but the man himself can hardly prove such a blunt declaration about such rigorous subjects as religion and philosophy.

 I  define ignosticism as the notion that as His attributes are incoherent and contradict each other, He is meaningless, conrary to my friend David Ramsay Steele who finds Him understandable. What I mean is that whilst one can fathom the  definitions of His attributes and Him, their incoherence really means that He means nothing.
 David states that had scientists resorted to verification, they'd have overlooked atoms and now- superstrngs,  but right before that he states in principle. Indeed, those two matters in principle were knowable whilst God defends on theologian's it must be's and guesses [ John Hick really guesses in dealing with the problem of evil1]. 
 I find as arguments for Him beg the question, such notions as First Cause are meaningless such that theistic arguments themselves affirm ignosticism or in this case, kake it igtheism.

"Additional information 

I wonder if we could embellish the narrative on this election. There were at least three very important developments in this race.

1. It was the first presidential election in which the national ticket was nominated in conventions. The Anti-Masonic, National Republican, and Democratic Parties held national conventions. 

2. One of the major issues was nullification (the idea that states could 'nullify' or veto congressional legislation). Calhoun refused to run with Jackson for this reason, and South Carolina entered a brief anti-Democratic phase. Calhoun resigned as VP, the first person to do that, and became an anti-administration U.S. Senator. 

3. Another major issue was the National Bank. Clay forced a vote on extending the charter of the Bank in the summer of 1832. Jackson vetoed it. Clay felt that the Bank would be critical to economic development. Jackson did not have a specific policy - Van Buren later created the independent treasury system which laid the groundwork for the banking system which is still in place.",0.0

 TTP: """"They are not affiliated with the Afghan Taliban of Mullah Omar who are supported by the Pakistani army and state."""" 

Hi, while I agree for the most part with the above statement, I have to take issue with a little bit of the wording, as petty as that may seem.  I believe that stating that the two groups have no """"direct"""" affiliation would be clearer.  Reference #6 indicates that at some level they do have some sort of affiliation although they are both independent of one another.

Also, the source cited regarding Pakistani support for the Afghan Taliban only alludes to incidents prior to the US invasion of Afghanistan.  However, Reference #6 (from 2009) does indicate more current coordination between elements within the ISI and the Afghan Taliban.  I am going to modify the statement slightly to reflect these two points.

 Is Brian really an atheist? 

In the recently aired episode, """"April in Quahog"""", Brian can be clearly observed praying some time after the news report leads the public to believe that a black hole is going to swallow the earth. Also, at the end of the episode, Brian leaves the house saying he made a deal with someone that now that the earth is spared he would go volunteer at the soup kitchen. Based on the context of the situation and Stewie's remark in the background that the 'someone' Brian made a deal with was God, this calls Brian's atheism into question and suggests that he has developed some closeted religious beliefs (though other evidence from previous episodes might lead one to suspect that they have been there all along). There are only two other explanations for this series of events that I can think of: One would be that one of the underlying ideas behind the episode is something to the tune of 'there are no atheists in foxholes', though this is unlikely because Brian can be seen following through with his promise which a person who had temporarily reverted to religion because of fear wouldn't do, let alone that any kind of conservative message is very unlike McFarlane. The other would be that McFarlane is somehow poking fun at peoples' work righteous attitude towards religion, however this is also unlikely because in order to understand the joke, an in depth understanding of what Christianity actually teaches would be required which most people (including McFarlane) likely do not posses.

_______________________________________________________________________

I have no problem with the Boeing report, but its conclusion is for tether lengths that are much longer than the ones that are being discussed in this article.  This is where your lack of knowledge about engineering is a problem.
The mass of a space tether goes up with length.  Assuming it could take the thermal environment, you can build a space tether out of kite string.  But there is a limit on how long this space tether could be made based on the strength to weight ratio of the string.  This is where designers start making tapered lines that have more cross sectional area in the middle than at the ends.  Even with this there are still limits on the length based on cost and total mass.  You can make an Earth surface to geostationary orbit space elevator using kite string but it will be larger than the Earth, hence not practical.  That doesn't mean that you still can't use that kite string to fly a kite, obviously you can.  The difference is in the length.  The space elevator is 100,000 km long.  Your kite string is only a few hundred feet at most.  The same applies to skyhooks.  You could build a 100,000 km long space elevator out of T1000GB carbon fibers but it would have near planetary mass and as a result isn't practical.  But like the much shorter kite string for flying a kite, a skyhook made of carbon fibers in the 200 km to 4,000 km range is possible.
As to the references not all being open source on the internet there is not much I can do about that.  You will need to either pay for them or go to a university library that pays for access to them and have them downloaded.  References 7, 18, and 19 are open source.  Reference 19 is only for the part of that paper that covers non-rotating skyhooks and does not include the entire paper.  If you want to see the entire paper do a search using the title on google, it is open source.  
Quite simply the information is out there but you will have to do a little digging or pay for it.  You will also need a basic understanding of engineering and orbital mechanics in regards to space tethers.  For that I recommend the """"Tether in Space Handbook"""", it is also open source on the internet, see reference 7.
You could also just read the abstracts for the non-open source papers and you will get an idea that this is a workable concept.  Or you could just notice who is writing these reports; NASA, reference 19, Lockheed Martin, references 5, 8, 9, and 10, and Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, reference 7.  Do you really think these organizations would be wasting their time and money on a lie?

To conclude with the Boeing report.  The Boeing report says 
1) """"His analysis showed that because a hanging tether must be tapered to support its lower end in the gravitational field of the Earth, achieving a HyperSkyhook tether tip rendezvous with a 5.0 km/s (16 kft/s or Mach 16) airplane would require a HyperSkyhook tether mass of 25 times the payload mass.""""

5.0 km/s is 64% of low Earth orbit velocity.  A tether mass of 25 times payload mass can be built.  I have no argument with this.

2) """"Trying to lower the tether tip speed to 4.0 km/s (13 kft/s or Mach 13) would require a HyperSkyhook tether mass greater than 200 times the payload mass.""""

4.0 km/s is 51% of low Earth orbit velocity.  A tether mass of 200 times payload mass sounds about right and it is highly unlikely that such a tether length would be economic.  Again no disagreement.

The tether tip speeds for the non-rotating skyhook examples in this article, and in all the references I have listed, start at 96% of low Earth orbit velocity and go to approximately 70% of low Earth orbit velocity.  There is no reason to go any lower.
As a result, the final line of the Boeing quote, """"In general, the non-spinning tether HyperSkyhook concept does not look competitive with the spinning tether concepts. """" does not apply for two reasons.  1) It doesn't apply to the skyhook lengths in the article, and 2) it is an unfounded over generalization that falls under the category of sales BS that is promoting rotating skyhooks.

Do you now understand how the Boeing quote that you are so fond of does not apply to the non-rotating skyhooks in this article?

PS  The reference numbers are for the article as I have written it.  Since you keep deleting references with your changes, the reference numbers keep changing, hence you will need to use the article as I have written it if you want the reference numbers quoted here to mean anything.

So please, read this until you understand it and do your research to confirm what I and many others are saying.

 Deletion of Massacre in Peleponnese 

Sorry but what you're doing can be considered as a  case of vandalism, i guess. I prepared the article myself compare it with any other previous article you will also notice that..If you bother to look into the talk page of Greek war of independence i even provided a scanned version of one page from the author William St. Clair, upon the insistence of some Greek users that i made up myself these quotations..If using properly cited quotations would be considered as """"copyright infringement"""" then the entire wikipedia has to be deleted..
Btw, i used some, only some, of the quotations that Mccharty used in his book, but then i can access tomorrow the original copies and post them from the first hand sources, what would that change? i already have in my hand William St.Clair's book """"William St. Clair, That Greece Might Still Be Free The Philhellenes in the War of Independence, Oxford University Press London 1972 ISBN 0192151940 """", all the quotation that i took from there was mine, without any other intermediaries..Regards """,0.0

"""Fish-man, hello, and welcome to Wikipedia.  Thank you for taking the time to examine Wikipedia policies and base your arguments for keeping No-boo on them, and also for being polite when making your arguments.  VfD pages really aren't the place for me to be making lengthy arguments, so I'll respond to your points here instead.

First, you should be aware that anonymous users who sign up for accounts just to argue about the article being voted on are still effectively anonymous users, and are still not going to have their votes counted.  At this point I think it is really too late for you to establish a history at Wikipedia that would result in your vote being counted.  Again I refer you to Wikipedia:Deletion_guidelines_for_administrators#Rough_consensus for this information.  (Anonymous authors who request that their articles be deleted are often given consideration, but not those who want them kept.)
Whether they're specifically enumerated on What Wikipedia is not or not, articles about neologisms are not encyclopedia material.  Firstly, #2 on that page indicates that Wikipedia articles are not dictionary definitions, and as a neologism is just a particular kind of word, an article on a neologism is necessarily a dictionary definition.  Secondly, encyclopedia articles cannot describe neologisms because they cannot describe things that are as yet unestablished.  """"No-boo"""" may or may not be a word with some currency today, but it remains to be seen whether it will become part of the language.  Once we can determine that the term has staying power and is culturally or historically significant—which time will likely not come for months or years—then we can write an article on it.  Or rather, we could, if it weren't going to be just a dictionary definition.
If the article in question is not about a word but actually about an event called """"The No-boo Affair"""", then it ought to be entitled No-boo Affair.  In that case, I would still vote to delete it, on the grounds that it is a news story.  Again, there is no evidence at this time that this news story is going to have any historical significance, and considering that the substance of the news story is """"the AP made a mistake; they said some people booed at a speech but really nobody did"""", it seems very unlikely that it will ever have historical significance.  (You characterize the AP's error as a """"clear falsification"""", but I see no evidence of malicious intent by the AP, and anyway it's still not an encyclopedia's job to document falsehoods by the AP.  If the AP has a history or pattern of such falsehoods, and it is well-documented by other unbiased sources, then we can make a note of it in Associated Press.)  If the term """"no-boo"""" becomes well established—which, again, we will not know for months or years—then perhaps it will be appropriate for us to record this news story as the origin of the term.  Certainly, Wikipedia has articles on other recent news stories.  However, most are stories of definite historical signficance, and those that are not should also be deleted.
Wikipedia wants articles on items that are currently in the news, yes.  In this case there are many things related to the story that people might want to look up.  If we didn't already have them, we could add articles on George W. Bush, William J. Clinton, West Allis, Wisconsin, booing, the Associated Press, the White House, the Republican National Convention, New York, etc.  But this """"No-boo Affair"""" is not an encyclopedic topic in the news; it is a breaking news story.

It is important to understand that an encyclopedia is not simply a gathering of assorted facts, but rather a secondary source that compiles significant pieces of human knowledge that have already been well-established by other sources.  There are many places on the internet and offline where you can disseminate facts and opinions about this event, but Wikipedia is not one of them.  — 18:08, 15 Sep 2004 (UTC)""",0.0

 SC Info 

Im almost positive that this is not the place I'm supposed to be responding, but there is no reply link at your message.

Part of the reason for my """"offense"""" is that I think your being unfair in referring to it as spam.

If I was just posting """"Hey! Come visit my site,"""" without any contribution, that would be one thing. But, when I posted anything from my own site, I had news attached to it.  You didn't have a problem when I posted the news of the departure of the producers and writers of the movie and linked to RopesOfSilicon.com, and you also didn't have a problem when I posted the purchase of Dreamworks by Paramount and linked to Yahoo! News, but when the news happened to come from my site, even if it is legitimate news, it's spam. I happen to be in a position that I have connections and can make alot more news than other sites. But that shouldn't make the news any less relivant in getting it to people. 

When I take the time and care enough to try to make sure the info is correct, only to have it removed and replaced by the same wrong information, it's very frustrating, and it does come back to us at Ubisoft. For example, someone came to the official forums and said they saw on Wikipedia that Tom Cruise had accept the role of Sam Fisher in the movie. Well that is not true. So I had to correct him and that has happened a few times with a few wrong pieces of information. Which is why I went to the extent to find the correct info. But, if you are not in control of the other pages...and judging by the fact that the incorrect info that I removed has been replaced, it seems those who are in charge seem to perfer having incorrect information posted, so my hands are tied. 

Frankly, I'm getting tired of trying to help and getting railed back for what I see as petty reasons everytime. 

Also the back and forth with you removing my fan page from the list and the two other sites to the bottom, only to have me move them back was something I did because I have problems with an owner of another fansite following me around and well..not being nice. I was thinking it was him that was removing the info.""",0.0

I cling to facts and truth. Many of your so-called reliable sources couldn't even tell you what Minor Threat and Black Flag sounded like let alone these bands.

Greenwald isn't any better of a source. He's just someone that wrote a bad book. Big deal. Don't you even understand why it'd be hard to get old articles on here? No internet existed. Bands broke up fast. Records are out of print. The record labels closed. No talking heads in the media knew what the hell emo was in the early 90's. Common sense. And this article doesn't even really talk about what makes emo emo, and I know someone like you couldn't do that either. Instead of talking about what kind of music or vocals are used, time is wasted on lyrical content. Those are words. Lyrics do not define music genres. Anyone can write a song about any topic they want. The point of the genre is to describe the actual music involved and how it's played. Where's the fact that bands very rarely used clean, melodic singing vocals early on? It was either a yelling/screaming type vocal from hardcore, or they would actually just talk in the songs like how bands like Indian Summer and Moonraker did. Genre is how you play, not what you say.

I started editing on Wikipedia just to keep my mind occupied, I'm going through deep shit, when I started reading the factual errors and the sick shit like mentioning mortality, dying and suicide on the prognosis section of anorexia nervosa, I started contributing out of altruism. 

Wikipedia occupies the first spot on most searches, for self righteous, incompetent dickheads ( can I say that or am I violating WP:Dickhead?) to claim ownership and disseminate bullshit is wrong, it makes Wikipedia look bad and more importantly people are getting bullshit information. 
There is one particular individual who seems to clamor for attention, his 15 minutes of fame went to his head. All the articles he created are one sentence to a paragraph long.

Yes it may have been an independent entity at some point in time however it never was of much signifigance. It was always subjecated to a more powerful empire.

That at least points to the fact that they lived alongside each other and just as with Sumerian and Akkadian society merging to form classic Babylonian society the same happened of Akkadian/Assyrian society. In fact Assyria started as a Babylonian colony.

It isn't really that big but it is really nice, and big enough for Adelaide, at least. I'm so glad we are on par with the other capital cities now. You should really go and have a look at it.

I took some photos while I was there. Might add them later. If you go could you possibly take a photo of the new airport from the outside? I forgot to do this. Thanks.",0.0

The crown prosecution service charged the gang with 75 charges relating to twenty six girls, ranging from rape to intimidating witnesses, though police believed there were many more victims. The men were charged in three separate trials.

I think that the following need to be made clear as the have quite an impact upon how content is presented and also perceived. 
 There were three trials over many months. Clarity needed. 
 The trails were covered by reporting restrictions - that affects what is reported here.
 Full details of the trials are not public domain due to the need to protect victims - UK Law Applies. 

Big Questions - 
 Does the table give undue prominence? 
 Who should be included - all accused - only the guilty - only those assessed as guilty of sexual offences - what are the criteria to be used?
 Should it list only charges found Guilty or should all charges including not guilty and dismissed be listed? 
 The Jury were unable to reach verdicts in all charges and the judge ordered they were to be left lie on file for future retrial should new evidence arise  - this needs to be addressed as it is a legal reality and on record.

Should the table address sentencing rather than charges? This may seem a cop out, but I have to point to the rights of Victims to use Wiki and not be abused by overly detailed content which does not add to overall reality. Footnotes can direct those who need full details to external sources.

You Can't Stop Me
Dear Bongwarrior

My suspicion is that you are suffering major shrinkage from the inordinate amount of cannabis you have consumed over the course of your useless life. I understand that the prostitutes you procure so regularly laugh at the size of your penis, however I would implore you not to let this shortcoming (if you'll pardon the pun) stamp out the fun that happy, prosperous and sexually capable teenagers can have vandalising wikipedia. Hopefully you wake up and learn that those of us who don't want to consume cannabis, live of welfare payments, drop out of university and edit """"incoherent ramblings"""" on Wikipedia for a living may want to have a facet to their lives which does grant them fun without having to chase pink elephants around their parent's basements all day. 

Also, Bongwarrior is two words - and therefore in my opinion your username constitutes an """"incoherent rambling"""". But then again, your probably too high and sexually deprived to employ any reason and acknowledge this. You're parents having """"relations"""" is probably one of the most costly mistakes that society will have to bear - because undoubtably everybody else's taxes will be use to subsidise the treatment you receive for schizophrenia in five years. Seriously mate, just get a fuggen life, because you're not going to stamp on my fun.

There are two different issues. The . While that doesn't mean they can never be cited, it is unlikely to go without discussion.

Again, as I've already pointed out, doing a theme summary of 'Hamlet' is really no different from doing a character list.

And I have no idea where people are getting their strange and eccentric ideas of what a """"theme"""" is.  Some people who have posted here need to go to Merriam-Webster online, and look up the word """"theme.""""  A theme is a motif, a recurring idea.

Of course, of course, Pharos, I am familiar with Judaism (I edited to """"Feature Artice"""" the Names of God in Judaism)... The point I am making is that the concept of divinity is very diverse amongst religions. This article is entitled """"List of self-proclaimed deities"""". It is not called List of people that claim or claimed to be God.  My contention is that the article needs to narrow its scope to become useful. For example, in Sikhism, (and Andries is correct in regard of non-idolatry), their gurus are considered to be of divine providence (see the halos behind any Sikh guru portrait...).  For example if we call this article, """"List of people that claim or claimed to be the Creator"""", it will be an appropriate distinction.

"Hello Ensiform. I'm not impressed by the dozens of books at Amazon, for the simple reason that they're all published by American Research Press or other vanity presses. I have looked for peer-reviewed work by others about Smarandache functions and what-not, and there appear to be about three papers or a maybe a few more. But I think that's not immediately relevant, as I'll try to state below.

Smarandache appears to use publicly available resources to promote himself very diligently. Usenet, FOLDOC, Mathworld at wolfram.com, and even Sloane's On-Line Encyclopedia of Sequences all have lots of Smarandache-related entries. Sloane's is an interesting case, since each entry lists an author, and for the Smarandache entries the authors are charlestle@yahoo.com and other possible pseudonyms. Also,the link shown on the FS talk page (http://www.uoregon.edu/~ncp/Spam/SpamFiles3/DigitalLibSpam.txt) appears to show him sending unsolicited email under an assumed name. This suggests to me that it is possible that all edits on the FS page were made by him under assumed names.

Wait- you added this to the article???  

For starters, this definition of Erotica:
""""It is the depiction of sexual acts, pure and simple""""
Has no citation.  Who came up with this definition?  Because it is pretty much a crock as far as I'm concerned.  What about the notion of suggestion, which seems the major distincton between erotica and pornography.  By the definition you chose to attribute, a depiction of an individual in a suggestive pose (IE not a """"sexual act"""") is exempt from being called """"erotica"""" .

Hmm...I found this in Nature about copernicium's symbol. So was cyclopentadienyl a factor, or not? (Do you have information about this?

 Latvia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2015 

Hey there! I created an article for Latvia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2015 and I was wondering if you could help me out by verifying the translations of the rules I made from a document posted on LTV's website . I noticed on your user page that you have written that you are fluent in Latvian so if you have the time I would appreciate your help! My main concern is that I believe they wrote that they will select ten artists and songs to compete in this national final, but during their description of the shows, I'm not sure I understood how they will select only four entries for the final during the preceding shows.   
I haven't spoken/read/written Latvian (I mostly spoke Czech at home even when I lived in Latvia) in a pretty long time so I'm a bit rusty, so don't hold it against me if I misinterpreted, but here's what I got out of the rules. The first semi-final is non-elimination and just supposed to introduce the songs to the audience. In the second and third semi-finals, two songs are eliminated in each show,",0.0

The Decision to Come to America
We lived very nicely in Skala. We always had a servant and we had a new house that had just been built. We lived very nicely until the fire. Everybody tried to save their own property and it was windy and the fire spread all over the city. Our house didn't go because it wasn't directly in town. But all businesses and everything else went. [Maryam (Mary) Wiesenthal Brill]

After the fire, it was a time of great migration. [Usha (Dorothy) Wiesenthal Gross]
[Note: The """"Great Fire of Skala"""" is believed to have taken place in 1899.]

I came to America because my father didn't want I should become a soldier and eat not kosher stuff there in their army. My brother Sam came before me. He sent me the shiffskarte, ticket. And he sent me some money to come here and I paid him everything when I started to work. [Yankel (Jacob) Wiesenthal]

All the enterprising young men came, because they were poor and to escape the army. [Usha (Dorothy) Wiesenthal Brill]

I don't remember my father [who died when she was young]. My mother wanted to come, but only the three of us were left in Skala, my mother and Ada and me. My other sisters [who already were in America] couldn't afford to take us together. So I was the first one. I came just because Jake went [she accompanied her male cousin]; otherwise I wouldn't go. I was a teen-ager, thirteen or fourteen. I didn't want to come to America. I was crying. [Chana (Anna) Menchel]

We came because we couldn't make a living there. It would be a shame for the girls to go as maids in Skala. There was no way of making a living. [Hudya (Ada) Menchel] 

 
From Skala to Hamburg or Antwerp

7. Emigrants took the train from Skala We went by train, all the way from Skala to Hamburg. [Yankel (Jacob) Wiesenthal]
We got the boat in Antwerp. First we went by horse and buggy to some neighbors in another town and we stayed overnight there. And then we went by train to Antwerp. Another thing I remember, of course, we were third class and they stopped for a while for you to get water. There was no water on the train. So I remember my mother left us three kids on the train and she had a kettle and she went to get water and I nearly died. The others didn't know the difference. I felt sure the train was going to start without her. [Maryam (Mary) Wiesenthal Brill]
 

 
In Hamburg
We stayed overnight in Hamburg before we went on the ship. I remember I was really very young. I was a kid. And when we came to Hamburg, I was afraid. I only wanted to go to sleep with my cousin Jake. So he says to me, you can't go to sleep with me. Don't forget, you're a girl; I'm a man. You have to sleep with the girls. This I'll never forget. [Chana (Anna) Menchel] 
8. The emigration hall in Hamburg, early 20th century 

 
Aboard Ship

9. Aboard ship We were three children and we had one berth. All the four of us slept together in one berth. With our mother. You know how narrow those berths were. [Maryam (Mary) Wiesenthal Brill]
We were in an upper berth. And there was a very rabid Polish lady coming to America in the berth below. She probably didn't like it that there were four people above her and she started out with a real hatred of us. Anyway, one day I wet myself and some of it went through. So then the woman went to complain to the captain. And she said, """"Not only did this woman's child wet my bed, but she stole my best blouse."""" She accused my mother of stealing her blouse and they came and looked among my mother's possessions, but they didn't find it. [Usha (Dorothy) Wiesenthal Gross]

 

We came through steerage, of course. Somebody else was in the room with us and my mother said in Yiddish, I hope my daughter doesn't get sick. But I was very sick and so was my mother. [Hudya (Ada) Menchel]

Responding here to SlimVirgin's point about purging of the archives. That stops people gaining accessed to WMF-held archives of the list, but it does nothing about personal copies of mailing list correspondence kept by individual arbitrators. There are some arbitrators who have been on the committee for years (much longer than I was), and if archives are purged then any personal archives they may hold would be the next logical target. There are ways to make that attack vector less vulnerable, though, and purging the archives would ensure that new arbitrators only have access to what they get while on the committee. So on balance, I think purging of the archives is something that should, and likely will, be done. Trouble is, it looks like it is a bit late now, and it also raises the problem of verifying the leaks. How can you verify that a """"leak"""" is genuine if the mastercopy has been destroyed?

Being intimidated at the polling place got my clear attention what the truth was, here is the article I would write, go ahead, shoot it full of holes. Enlighten me!

                                                       HOW OBAMA AND ACORN STOLE THE ELECTION OF 2008

Overview:
Presently, ACORN is under FBI investigation for massive voter fraud and other serious  crimes in connection to the 2008 presidential election directly concerning Barack Obama  who was one of its principles. It's a matter we take very seriously,"""" FBI spokeswoman  Bridget Patton told the Associated Press. """"It is against the law to register someone to  vote who does not fall within the parameters to vote, or to put someone on there  falsely."""" 

Acorn is the largest of a plethora of radical left wing groups with more than 1,200  neighborhood chapters in 110 cities across the country with a national budget of $37  million who's sole purpose was to suddenly prior to the election spring into action  after quietly building up over the years to gerrymander the 2008 presidential election  through massive voter fraud. However, they claim to be nonpartisan but are radically  left wing with actual communist memberships. Most of their funding comes from U.S.  government grants. Further, to that end their intentions were to bring in and harbor  hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens from various countries and placing them in HUD  public housing and """"choice"""" voucher programs awarding free houses to illegal aliens at  taxpayer expense while wantonly neglecting the disabled who desperately needed housing  thereto. This was coerced into action through legal threats to these agencies citing  civil rights laws. 

Through these intimidations, using civil rights laws it further precipitated first the  collapse of the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac when these impossible  mortgages collapsed in the fall of 2008 along with the other forced """"minority"""" bad loans  at HUD which led to the collapse of the mortgage industry starting a domino effect that  led to the failing of all top five investment banks on wall street and the mess we are  in today in February 2009. The government initiated """"bailouts"""" (really government  theft) and gifted itself nearly ten trillion dollars in """"stimulus packages"""" as an  excuse to fix this smaller two hundred billion dollar bad mortgage problem. Most of  this on debt to China who has precipitated this by pegging the dollar and implementing  grossly unfair trade practices initiating monstrous trade deficits and debt we will  never rise above. Although President George Bush(R) played his share in ridiculous  deregulation, ACORN with backing from Barney Frank(D) the chairman of the House  Financial Services Committee which oversees housing and banking industries really  initiated the whole debacle by forcing these ridiculous minority loans.  

The case details: 
95% of polled U.S. citizens object to illegal immigration and open boarders.  Nonetheles, Maricopa County Arizona is a microcosm, analogues to how the influx of  illegal and legal immigration is causing huge population increases raising serious  questions about their rising undue influence upon our elections, particularly the  election of Barack Obama of late and the fairness, legality and constitutionality  thereof as assessed by CNN and announced by prime-time television CNN anchor Lou Dobbs  upon his analysis of the latest census figures ramifications. Such is the case because  in Maricopa County, much like other counties in the United States population not  citizenship determines voting districts. And there's clear, mounting evidence that  both illegal and legal aliens are replacing long time residence and partisans using  people that can't vote as """"filler people"""" to fill up the extra people needed to make up  a given district along with the people that favor their political party. Such is  particularly the case because the census figures don't distinguish the difference  between legal and illegal aliens and most of the illegals are coming across the border  from Mexico who is actively investing in and interfering in our electoral process.  v=8oTQoZifckU&feature;=related 

Polls in Mexico indicate that the majority favored Obama and the election results  showed clearly that such """"minority"""" voters such as """"Hispanic"""" and """"African American""""  voters overwhelmingly voted for him and clearly won the election for Obama. See  Wikipedia United States presidential election of 2008

 Individual UFC Articles Are Back And There's Nothing You Can Do About It

Reverting vandalism is much easier than debating though, which is why I've assisted in maintaining the page. The biggest problem is that the definition of main event varies. For example, why is Chavo/Kane from WM24, a match never promoted by the company as a main event, listed, but not Flair/Michaels from the same show, which the company considered making the actual main event (and, indeed, several WWE folks said afterwards that it should have). Other examples exist. Why Kane/Undertaker from WMXX, but not Undertaker/Michaels from WM25, another match which was heavily promoted and considered for the final match on the show? (Presumably, it's because someone around here is a Kane fan) Because of these (and other) inconsistancies, we should limit it the actual final match on the card.  0422

2. I did not state that Peter Taylor is a """"mere journalist.""""  If I did, my apologies to Peter Taylor.  Indeed, please point it out where I used the phrase """"mere journalist."""" 

I did state that he has written some excellent books.  For better or worse, historians are not journalists.  They have different schools for each, in fact.  Provos accompanied a documentary broadcast; it's a great publication, but it's not a detailed history of the Provisional IRA.  The wikiepedia entry for Peter Taylor states, """"Peter Taylor born Scarborough, North Yorkshire is a British journalist and documentary-maker who had covered for many years the political and armed conflict in Northern Ireland, the so-called Troubles. From his experience he has written and produced books and television documentaries on the Northern Irish conflict.""""  The entry for J. Bowyer Bell states, """"The Troubles began in Northern Ireland in 1969, and Bell's The Secret Army: the IRA 1916-1970 was published the following year, and was one of the first detailed histories of the IRA along with The IRA by Tim Pat Coogan which was also published in 1970.""""  Many of the people that Taylor interviewed were also interviewed by Bell; and Bell probably interviewed them first and, in some cases, more than once (though Taylor probably interviewed several people multiple times, too).  

3. One Night In Hackney states above that he """" wasn't using one source over another, I was using what the source actually said.""""  But Bell clearly states, as noted above, """"Ruairi O Bradaigh, Daithi O Conaill, and about one hundred others walked out to form Republican Sinn Fein.""""  So, the sources disagree.  At one point, I believe, the word """"twenty"""" was in there.  It is not in there now, and from my view this is appropriate.  If the sources disagree we should not choose one over the other, but instead we should either acknowledge the differences and quote from each or find a way to be neutral  not quoting from either.

4. Once again there has been a dispute in which One Night in Hackney has chosen one source over another and then when confronted with a direct quotation from an alternate source he has chosen to ask questions, change the subject, and deny the validity of the source.  The reality is that Taylor and Bell are both valid sources, and Bell was clearly talking about people walking out of the Ard-Fheis.  Bell might have been wrong, Taylor might be wrong, but we as Wikipedia editors are not in a position to make that determination.  To do so is to engage in Original Research. WH.

""""I am not a crook"""" & """"never obstructed justice""""
Text of press conference , extracted version . 

Neither of the above partial and incomplete transcripts contain Nixon's quote, or the question to which he responded.
you can't find it in the official text of http://watergate.info/judiciary/APPI.PDF, or the extrated version, cause it's not there. The House Judiciary Committee which was holding the Watergate hearings, it appears, did feel question's on Nixon's personal finances and taxes returns were not germane to thier proceedings.
Sounds like a conspiracy theory to me.  I'm sure there is a transcript out there that contains both the question asked of Nixon, as well as his response, that the 'plumbers' haven't gotten to yet.   7 July 2005 21:06 (UTC)

From Facts on File 1973, Volume 33, No. 1719 Oct. 7-13, 1973, pg. 854, 
""""The White House refused to confirm or deny an Oct. 3 report in the Providence (R.I.) Journal-Bulletin that President and Mrs. Nixon paid only $792.81 in federal income taxes for 1970 and $878.03 in 1971""""

From Facts on File 1973, Volume 33, No. 1725 Nov. 18-24, 1973, pg. 964, 
""""The President made the declaration in discussing his personal finances.  The President was asked about a press report he paid $792 in federal income tax in 1970 and $878 in 1971 and whether public officials should disclose their personal finances.""""

Still no transcript of the question above.  Accuracy and POV of the above quotes questionable as well.  """"persoanl?"""" """"Presidnet?"""" """"inbcome?""""
So I am a half blind clutz who can barely type 30 words per minute, nonetheless they are accurate citations that can be found in virtually any public library.
 I didn't mean to demean your typing skills.  I make my fair share of mistakes as well.  My intent was to point out that the above 2 extracts from """"Facts on File"""" do not specifically relay the content of the question to which Nixon was responding when he mentioned never having obstructed justice.  7 July 2005 21:06 (UTC)  

""""New York Times article by R. W. Apple, November 17, 1973 

The above cited NYTimes article does not present the question to which Nixon responded.  
You will find this in virtually all press accounts of the event, because the question 'had nothing to do with Watergate.  The best they can do is call it Watergate related, or allied.
 Actually, you are incorrect.  The Post article specifically states that he was responding to Watergate related questions.  Of course he is talking about his personal finances and taxes when he says he has never profited from his position  but that is not the whole quote.  You seem to keep evading discussion on the part where he also denies obstructing justice.  I believe that if we had a transcript of exactly what he is responding to, it would go a long way to clearing things up.  7 July 2005 21:06 (UTC)

It does, however, support the fact that the cursory investigations were indeed related to the Watergate investigations: """"After months of torment over the Watergate and allied scandals, the President gave detailed answers to more than a dozen questions.""""''  Further support that Nixon's quote and the Watergate scandal are at least somewhat related can be found in the Washington Post article here:

I am pretty sure that you have to reread what i wrote as you must have read what i wrote on purpose to provocate a mexican or his cactus, because of recent trauma.
My personal attacks are in fact a critic of wikipedia system in view of recent actions of some editors, and the critic of the us government and other general, very, assertions, but nothing persdonal. As for vandalism I was the one being vandalised and reacting to it on a very propper way by propper actions, as reinserting ALL persons edits and not just mine, with significant informations as my reason to do so.
I also think that some people in the story have been pretty quick at giving blame without having read anything of the contain wich say one or two things about their morality and how they view the WP/NPA, biaize, if you see what i mean.
I was trying since 5 days to get somebody from the wiki board to take a look at some specifik things but I still wait for the answer.
It was before I actually participate in any debate or talk page.
I begin to do so the 10th PM and was banned the 14th PM
It went very fast, with revert and archivising and reverting of all my edits, and my banishment in the course of the 14th, less than 9 hours exactly.
Thats a guiness record i think, some should get a reverted ban star for that kind of thing.
Try to contact me by email or give me your or an email or unblock me, bref one way we can communicate.
Good you answered to my joke, now i met an admi who isnt a mormon and who is a specialist in all what i ignore.
Its going to be a fruitfull encounter, hope it will be reciproque.

contact me here or on that mail: sophie@nostromo.dk

I hope very soon, if not you will have saved me from becoming a wikiaddict, there is so many other things I should do, this geak is insane.

 Unreliable sources misquotes source 

Your source for the extirpation by whalers of the Atlantic gray whales is suspect. Among the two sources it cites is Bryant's 1995 paper on Atlantic gray whale specimens. Bryant (p. 860, right column) merely speculates that whaling may have been the cause of its disappearance, stating that """"This population of gray whales apparently disappeared during periods of active coastal whaling on both sides of the North Atlantic, supporting the possibility [my italics] that whaling activities were responsible for, or at least contributed to, its extinction"""". However, these whaling activities (as far as we know) primarily targeted right whales, as I stated above. Earlier (p. 860, left column) he asks """"Could the eastern North Atlantic gray whale have been extirpated by whaling activities? Unfortunately, early whaling activities off the coast of Europe are poorly documented.""""

Hey asshole.

Stop putting in the redundant phrase """"a claim unsupported by other modern or ancient sources"""", shitface. The Encyclopedia Iranica does indeed find support in the ancient sources (considering how many troops Ariobarzanes brought with himself to the battle of Gaugamela, and the nature of the location of the battle of the Persian Gates which could IMPOSSIBLY house any of the estimates given by Hammond or Waldemar Heckel) The Greek numbers given are obviously inflated and have no root in historical reality. How can Ariobarzanes magically summon more troops than Darius III Codomannus at Ecbatana (where the greater part of the nobility followed him)? Explain that to me, cuntface.

So stop being a shithead, pretty please? I will not relent in removing that phrase. It is stupid on so many levels and serves only as an attempt to discredit the Encyclopedia Iranica, when in fact it does a better job at cutting down customarily inflated Greek estimates than Hammond who takes his numbers straight from the Imperial Roman author Curtius-Rufus (Which was a thinly veiled political exaltation of emperor Vespasian).

This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

I have to disagree with you on several key issues. For example, the """"horse's mouth"""" is extremely likely to be biased in the horse's favor. If, for example, this local government had a reputation for corruption, or inefficiency, or waste, their own website and other government bodies' would be the last places to find references to that. Besides, primary sources cannot serve as an indication of notability. On the other hand, Wikipedia is independent, but it does not consider itself reliable.
The article's content is not really supported by the sources either, and I think at times it's simply wrong because you took too much poetic license. For example, """"beautiful ecosystems [...] valued by all British Columbians"""" - really? There's not a single person in British Columbia who doesn't value these ecosystem? So the article would have to be rewritten significantly to remove editorializing, personal opinions, hyperbole and the like.
So in summary, it may well be possible to write an article about the Islands Trust - but it would have to differ from this one in sources, tone and likely content.   """,0.0

"Yes there may well be a small number of law firm articles which do not have a complete list of offices, but the overwhelming majority do, as you will have no doubt have discovered yourself in your search. I don't believe that we should base our editing decisions on the quality (or lack thereof) of the Haynes and Boone PR office, who arguably should not have been editing that article in the first place anyhow.

 My firm belief is that details of the office locations of a law firm are essential to properly understanding that firm. If a firm has ten offices in the United States it could have ten offices in Kansas, ten offices in California, ten offices in New York or ten offices spread across Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, San Fransico, Dallas, Washington etc. In each case it would be a very different firm. 

 The same is true of the UK. Leeds, Birmingham, Manchester and London are all very different legal markets, and are all very different again from Croydon, Oxford, Norwich or Brighton. The location of the offices is very important in understanding the market that the firm is operating in - in my view it is as important as the number of lawyers, the turnover of the firm and the profits per partner.

 Again, I completely accept that at a certain point it becomes impractical to list all of a firm's offices in their Wikipedia article. That is clearly the case for PwC, with over 750 offices. I personally do not feel that 69 offices is an excessively large number to detail however, and the revised format of the list now takes up only a few lines in the article.

 Please consider that you are seeking to reduce the sum total of information available to Wikipedia readers. How do readers benefit from the deletion of this information? I can't see any way in which they do. And how do they gain? Again, I can't see any way in which they do. The information is correct, is cited and is factual. It helps readers' understanding of the firm. It is no more advertising than the article of a car manufacturer giving details of the cars that it makes.

 I appreciate that I am outnumbered in this particular discussion but do feel strongly that as a point of principal law firm articles should be allowed to have details of office locations, and that to not allow this would be to single out law firms and treat them differently to many other commerical organisations on wikipedia where far more extensive details of their products and services are allowed. The number of articles, replete with attractive photos and impressive performance details of BMW cars is for example very large: List of BMW vehicles. I have no particular problem with this, but wonder why law firms in general, and this law firm in particular, are being singled out for so much harsher treatment here.",0.0

Clean-up
Regarding Greiner's reverts, 1) it was proper to include the second comma in a series, for example A, B, and C, and his revision is therefore inappropriate; 2) it is proper to have the year series read 1988-90, as I had it, and therefore his revision is not appropriate, and 3) while it is the general rule to write out numbers one through nine, here  in baseball articles, and in articles that also have the same numbers in a series represented by numberals, as in hit """"9 home runs and ten home runs in consecutive years,"""" it is acceptable to have numbers 1-9 written out.  It especially aids the reader in articles such as this one, which are replete with numbers, in that numerals are easier to scan.

"Let me respond again.

I usually get a l lot of negative reaction when I introduce something with which lay readers are not familiar. 

I don’t have a pro-dictator bias. It just seems like that because I’m correcting articles that were already one-sided. History's not a pros and cons analysis anyway. Historians want to know why and how. 

Also, I don’t use one explanatory model (like Marxism, World Systems Theory, Dependency Theory, Modernization Theory, etc.) solely. I don’t keep my mind closed to one interpretation. 

If an article chronicles any facts, I leave them if they’re accurate. But they must be explained in a context. Statements like ‘he’s an authoritarian dictator bent on staying in power at all cost rejected by the international community’ will go in favor of statements like ‘because of his controversial policies he’s been ejected from the Commonwealth at Britain’s behest'. 

If an article mentions that Mugabe has been seizing white-owned farms it must also mention that 4,500 white farmers own 70% in the land in a country of 13 million. The article must also explain why land reform is a touted goal in the Third World. To many, that unacceptable because that's pro-Mugabe POVing. But quoting anti-Mugabe insults by as many famous people as possible is possible because it's a fact that they said those things. 

Some can’t tolerate that. To them, Mugabe persecutes homosexuals; he’s a racist; he subverts democracy; he cracks down against NGOs; he rigs elections; he’s unmitigated evil; and he does that because he’s evil. 

There are not that many social historians who would accept such simplistic, sweeping conclusions based on superficialities.",0.0

Well, dear Ahasuerus: It is actually difficult to edit any page in Wikipedia without Muslims jumping at you and trying to censor you with all sorts of excuses. You must understand that the freedom of speech for Muslims is an alien concept. In Islamic countries if you say something against Islam they kill you. Where they can't kill you, they censor you. Wikipedia seems to be dominated by Muslims. This of course is not true in all the pages where Muslims have no interest, but when the interest of Islam comes in, they can be quite bullish in making their word prevail. But that is another story. This article started with some explanation like this:

In recent years especially after the 9/11 some observers, including Muslim dissidents have stated that Islam presents a threat bigger than Nazism not to just the Western world but to all non-Islamic countries. They have labeled those who defend Islam and try to be politically correct about it, the today’s useful idiots. 

[Ali Sina] states: “They are idiots because they speak without knowledge of Islam and its threat to mankind and they are useful to the Islamists with whose help they can penetrate the non-Muslim countries and destroy them from within.”  The same author writes: “More abhorrent than war is making peace with evil. In the words of the 18th Century British parliamentarian Edmund Burke, """"All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing."""" Those who advocate peace with Islam are idiots of this century. If we do not stand against Islam it will grow and then billions will die. Trying to appease Muslims is foolish. It is informed by ignorance of Islam. Most cancers are treatable, if detected in time. But if ignored, they will grow to a stage that will kill you. Today we have the choice. We can either fight Islam and extirpate it before it threatens our existence or wait and face the apocalypses.” 

Muslims obviously don't like Ali Sina. For some reason anything you post here from him they will delete at once. So the above passage that explained the concept was deleted. The administrator SlimVirgin despite claiming impartiality, has yet to show that in actions. I could be wrong but for reasons that I explained to her, I have still to be convinced of that claim. I found out that she is Iranian, like Ali Sina, but of course most Iranians are still Muslims. She even once tried to discredit Ali Sina saying that he is Islamophobic. Obviously she sees genuine criticism of Islam unwarranted and interprets that as Islamophobia. My judgement about her is just based on my first impression and I could be wrong. I have explained to her my concern about her impartiality already and I hope she will eventually show I had misjudged her. 

In Wikipedia there is a lot of Islamic propaganda which are not true at all, but generally critical views about Islam do not survive. Why? If Wikipedia is impartial shouldn’t we give equal space to both sides? Would we accept if e.g. scientologist or any other cultists try to take over the Wikipedia and disallow any criticism of their cult? What is happening is very disturbing. There are hundreds of pages in Wikipedia that are misleading because they are edited and controlled by Muslims and as soon as you try to post anything showing the other side of the coin they revert it and even call your contribution “hate speech”. What about the Quran? Isn’t that book a hate speech?  

Funny thing is that they throw at you the basic rules of Wikipedia when in reality it is they who constanly breach those rules. 

If you try to write anything that Muslims don’t like they will delete it with invalid justifications. This is a very disturbing trend. For example the quotes of Ali Sina were removed because, as they said, he is not notable. There are 200,000 pages talking about faith freedom international. There have been death threats in Islamic sites against him, there are a few Islamic sites created just to refute him. Doesn’t all that say that he is notable at least to be quoted? Finally if he is notable enough to have a page in Wikipedia why his quotes should not be published? 

I am not familiar with the structure of Wikipedia, but I suppose there must be some committee that would check into complaints. (All I am hoping is that this committee is not already taken over by Islamists)  Is there a forum where important questions such as the direction Wikipedia is taking is discussed? 

Sorry, this subject might have not belonged to this page but these are things I would like to discuss. Is there a place to do that?  My point is that if Wikipedia loses its impartiality and becomes the guardian angel of a certain cult or religion, it loses its credibility fast.  05:13 2",0.14285714285714285
"""Compare it to other pictures of Lee Oswald. 

Fabricating pictures was quite primitive in 1963. Look at another Oswald picture on the page.

Which viewpoint does the reader believe?  Is the """"Big Chin"""" a sign of a fake or not? 

Gamaliel will now try to change the subject and won't directly discuss the """"Big Chin.""""

 

We've already discussed the Big Chin to death.  It was one of many allegations of photo manipulation dismissed by the HSCA. You want to mention it as if 1) it was never debunked 2) it's the most important thing ever 3) it is proof of conspiracy.    

Gamaliel, none of the three things you just wrote make any logical sense. 1)Some believe the chin is not a fabrication. So what? This doesn't mean these true believers have """"debunked"""" something. Its their opinion. The policy of this web site is to provide all opinions, and certainly not to hide the evidence. When are you going to understand this rule? 2) How important is it? It is relevant to Oswald's contention that some one was framing him. Whether that is the """"most important thing ever' is up to the reader. 3) Whether it is proof of a conspiracy is also up to the reader. 

Gamaliel, your frantic attempts to delete and hide any information that you disagree with is directly contrary to the web site rules. Why do you continue to do it?
 

Don't forget, there were two Oswald's. Lee Oswald and Harvey Oswald. One worked for the CIA and was the real triggerman, I forget which... But wait a minute, the fatal shot really came from the grassy knoll, from an anti-Castro Cuban, who wanted payback, for no air-support for Brigade 2506, during the Bay of Pigs disaster... No wait a minute Oswald was a paid hitman for the mafia...... oh well It's 3:37 in the AM, all this conspiracy stuff is making me loopy. Goodnight.
 

Gamaliel, is this person above who calls himself """"Mytwocents"""" your alter ego, and put in for comic relief?

 

Web site rules of inclusion of all significant viewpoints

The evidence of the fabricated photograph is a significant viewpoint that was discussed in the HSCA report. Some experts believe it shows fabricationsome don't. Under the rules of this web site all significant viewpoints should be presented. 

Claiming that someone else disagrees with a significant viewpoint on a subject is not a ground for excluding it from the article. 

Arguing it is not the """"most important thing ever"""" is not a ground for excluding the view point that the photographs are fabrications. 

Arguing that evidence that the photographs were fabricated is evidence of a conspiracy,  is not a ground for excluding the evidence.

Gentlemen. These are basic web site rules.

 

Leave this article in a readable state
Don't leave  after every goddamn sentence in a paragraph.  Use one tag; .  Free free to argue about content, but make sure the current content is at least readable.  I have just fixed a couple of paragraphs; I'm about to go after any others. 

You should control your anger. Content that is both controversial and unreferernced should be taken out. Do that instead. 

Control my anger?  What are you talking about?  I'm not in a position to verify either way - I just want to make sure that the article is readable for the users.

This article is not neutral

Surely it's not the job of Wikipedia contributors to decide whether or not Oswald worked alone, was part of a conspiracy or had anything to do with the assassination at all.  It seems to me that the only way of rendering a neutral article is to state that Oswald was arrested and held on suspicion of Kennedy's murder, but was killed before he could be tried.  It can then be provably stated that the Warren Commission, in its Report, concluded that Oswald was guilty and had worked alone, but that there have since been many efforts and arguments that attempt to disprove this conclusion.  

It's not our business to decide what really happened, which is what some people here are trying to do.  We are here to report on and check verifiable facts, not persuade peop",0.0

-Iraq War (By including all terrorist as the 1/3 of the population to be decimated)

He was a normal man who had been raped as a young boy much like Jerry Sandusky raped those little boys in the Penn State shower.

I am not proposing anywhere that the right-wing is staunchly authoritarian.

Copra was a main crop in Samoa before German trade, it's stated so in your own version. Yet then later saying that it was monopolized by Germans. There weren't enough Germans to work a plantation, at most were soldiers. Samoa trade was involved, yet your version paints a white on brown invasion of interests. 

The only partly decent section, is the sports section, which really could be larger, but of course the focus has to be on european arrival, as if that was the most amazing thing to happen to anyone.

 South China Institute of Technology 

Hello again
[Written before the block. Posting it anyway.] Hi Liuyg (or ). I have seen the Leiden ranking website. I did electronic searches for """"South"""" and """"China"""" but did not find South China University of Technology at all, so the page does not your claim that Leiden ranks SCUT as """"4th in China"""". If I made a mistake, just let me know what rank SCUT appears at, and I will add the information to the article myself.

Pages on universities have to present independently confirmed information on universities. Vague promotional language like """"world class"""" and """"top ranking"""" is not good enough. Also, you added no source to support your claim that SCUT was founded in 1924 and not in 1952. (Sun Yat-sen University was founded in 1924.) Besides, the long list of rankings is not proper Wikipedia format (see WP:UNIV): you should just name SCUT's rank and add the reference. Finally, your large edit is often made of incomplete sentences, and it removed a lot of useful wikilinks. You added too much flawed material at the same time, so I had to revert.

Some of the information you want to add might be valuable. Other editors, including myself, will help you if you add a small amount of material each time, or if you discuss your additions on the talk page.

 Klein, Max, and Piotr Konieczn. """"Wikipedia in the World of Global Gender Inequality Indices."""" Proceedings of the 11th International Symposium on Open Collaboration - OpenSym '15 (2015): n. pag. Web. . While Wikipedia's editor gender gap is important but difficult to measure, its biographical gender gap can more readily be measured. We correlate a Wikipedia-derived gender inequality indicator (WIGI), with four widespread gender inequality indices in use today (GDI, GEI, GGGI, and SIGI). Analysing their methodologies and correlations to Wikipedia, we find evidence that Wikipedia's bias in biographical coverage is related to the gender bias in positions of social power.

Kalla, Joshua L., and Peter M. Aronow. """"Editorial Bias in Crowd-Sourced Political Information."""" PLOS ONE PLoS ONE 10.9 (2015): n. pag. Web. . In this paper, we examine what kinds of biases exist in crowd-sourced information on Wikipedia. Because any user can also be an editor, no one person with any particular ideological or partisan motivation should be able to control Wikipedia. Yet scholars have recognized the tension that comes from distributed, crowd-sourced platforms like Wikipedia. On the one hand, crowd-sourced information platforms create opportunities for citizens to challenge media-driven narratives. On the other, these platforms may be captured by the self-interested who have the greatest motivation to shape them for their own benefit.

It might help, she suggests, if universities encouraged staff to become Wikipedia contributors, ensuring important academic work does not get ignored. They could, for example, expand the programmes some of them already run for academics on writing newspaper editorial columns - another area where female writers tend to be heavily outnumbered - to cover Wikipedia contributions. """"That is not something we usually do. We're scientists, we're not in the business of marketing our research. We have no training to do this,"""" said Prof Bruckner.

For Prof Bruckner, the Wikipedia project may also offer pointers about how the value of academic work in general is assessed.

“Savage's response was not that this showed a flaw in his method, rather that applying his method allowed individuals to improve their decision making.”

The first paragraph claims a descriptive role for the theory, but according to the second quote it is a normative theory about how people should reason.

 Urartu case 

First of all, I would like to complain about spying and stalking on all my activities from users like Nareklm. The latter recently interfered in page """"Request of Assistance"""" and removed a reference to personal attack which I reported to PAIN. I realize that my link is not valid anymore since it was archived. But case was reported - I have been insulted by Eupator.

Now - about Urartu.

First - I made my references. Those users  have been removed references. Wikipedia has a quite strong guidance about that. Further - about relevancy of my text, actually not only mine - there is other users who supported me)

I argue that section of """"Ethnic Composition"""" in page Urartu and page """"Antiquity"""" in page Armenia in its current version imply ethnic continuity and strong bonds between people who lived in Urartu (Academicians for example use term 'people of Urartu') and Armenians, who (sources I quoted say) moved in Urartu in 7-6 BC. My argument is not only about language diferrences. It is about ethnic and cultural ones. My arguments are on 'Request of Assistance' page. 

I'd like to quote professional historian about Urartu-Armenia nexus:

Philip L. Kohl, Clare Fawcett. Nationalism, Politics and the Practice of Archaeology (New Directions in Archaeology). Page 157: """"No less problematic are heavily slanted interpretations of the Urartian kingdom, the first historically attested state in Transcaucasia (ninth to seventh centuries BC). Armenian chauvinists must explain why this state, a worthy adversary of the neo-Assyrian Empire of northern Mesopotamia and one that expanded over much of """"historic Armenia,"""" composed its royal cuneiform inscriptions in Urartian, a non Indo-European ( i.e., non-Armenian) language, related to Hurrian and ancestral to the Northeastern Caucasian family of languages spoken today by different peoples in Daghestan, Chechenia, and Ingushetia (see Jankowska 1991:231). Reasonable historical hypotheses can be advanced for a Proto-Armenian component to this kingdom, and there is a real sense in which the Armenians are the cultural heirs of Urartu, but an essentialist view of Armenian culture which equates it precisely with the Urartian kingdom cannot be sustained. One must distinguish between popular and professional Armenian interpretations of Urartu, the latter being subtler and more difficult to evaluate. Thus, popular reference to the """"Piotrovskii problem"""" is based on the fact that B.B. Piotrovskii, the late Director of the Hermitage in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) and former head of the excavations at Karmir Blur (the ancient Urartian capital of Teishebaine now located within the city of Yerevan), had quite reasonably maintained that the mighty Urartian Iron Age kingdom did not constitute the first Armenian state for the reasons stated above; the """"problem"""" only existed for those who wanted Armenians always to have lived in and controlled """"historic Armenia"""" until the later ravages wrought by Romans, Persians, Arabs, and Turks. More discriminating professional archaeologists, who may accept the reasonable theory that the ethnogenesis or formation of Armenian culture occurred during post-Urartian Achaemenid times, extol the might of the Urartians and see them exercising political control over most of eastern Anatolia, western Iran, and Transcaucasia; in this respect they remain the direct precursors of the Armenian kingdom under Tigran II.""""  

Finally, the problem is not only in the content of dispute itself. It is also about behavior of users - their insults, reluctuance to accomodate various views. """,0.0

One last thing. Tiptoety, I was not a part of ED but you successfully drove me there – I opened an account a couple of days ago. I honestly tried to start on a clean slate and somehow contribute to Wikipedia with a healthy portion of common sense. Unfortunately, I fell victim to bureaucratic masturbation, which is fairly common here. You people have given me the ultimate proof that admins, bureaucrats, checkusers etc. don't know the first thing about properly investigating sockpuppets and block evaders. You fling arbitrary blocks by association, protect wikibullies, bite newcomers, """"guard"""" articles based on communal POVs (yes, yes, don't even try and deny it), refuse to exercise the tiniest bit of common sense in any situation... the list can go on for much longer, I just don't give a fuck anymore. Rest assured I'll have a new username sometime in the near future, I still want to be a good contributor because I really want to make Wikipedia better, as opposed to what the so-called """"seasoned editors"""" do here. It's like a badly run political party in here. You're the same bunch of trolls as ED... the difference is that at least they admit it while you pretentiously mask yourselves as a """"civil community""""... my ass.

3. they watched the Romans building a bridge and then they ran away? Dont take it personal, but this article isnt about Britain - witch was invaded as Gallien was. The Romans where overruled by trying to invade """"Germania"""" more than 3 times. The building of the colonies Germania magna and Germania inferior was more to make some good propaganda in Rome, cause the main population was there was Celtic, and the Germanic people there where new settlers looking for new ground. 
4. There is no Germany till 1871. Till that days Germany was splitted into 39 states, before 1815 into the unbelievable amount of more than 200 states. The states where fighting more each other than the foreign states, and so every invasion made by foreign nations was made with the help of some German states against some others.
5. What about the 30 years of war 1518- 1548, where the half of the population died? I know that you are obsessed with WWI and WWII but the history of Germany is mutch longer than that.
6. Austria and Germany where part of the holy roman empire of the German nation, and its unhistorical to devide them from Germany till the year of 1871
7. I know you will hate the idea, but when you take all of this together you have to write 200 German war- historys (Brandenburg, Sachsen, Hessen, Bayern, Schlesien, Hanse- cities...) till 1871, and from that day on you can begin your article

Hello again, Tdadamemd. Getting right to your comment about slang, I don't understand your stating that """"fuck"""" is not slang, or your linking to dictionary.com as proof that it is not. The word """"fuck,"""" while vulgar, is also slang; the dictionary.com source you cited even states so. It makes it clear that it can be slang for a variety of things, including sexual intercourse/other sexual activity. It list 13 numbered examples regarding what """"fuck"""" can mean. As for Wiktionary, I don't refer to sources like that. And, yes, I am fine with mentioning """"fuck"""" (or """"fucking"""") and the euphemism """"sleeping together"""" lower in the article, in the the Definitions and stimulation factors section, as alternative words for sexual intercourse/sexual activity. But again, there are a lot of terms for sexual intercourse, most of them slang. That these terms exist doesn't mean that all of them should be in this article. In fact, most times when there are many alternative terms for a word, especially if those terms are slang, we don't include all of them. As you know, this is an encyclopedia and not a dictionary. 

If WP:CONSENSUS is achieved for including your proposal, I'll add it by briefly summarizing that there are various vulgar and/or slang terms and euphemisms for sexual intercourse/other sexual activity...such as """"fuck"""" and """"sleeping together"""" (the wording won't be exactly like that, of course). And, really, because there are so many terms for sexual intercourse, and """"fuck"""" is not especially relevant to the topic of sexual intercourse (by that, I mean that most people and sources are not discussing the word """"fuck"""" when discussing sexual intercourse), that is probably why """"fuck"""" isn't currently in this article. Someone who is aware of your having repeatedly added it to the lead expressed to me via email me that """"fuck"""" is also U.S.-centric; so that's also something to think about, though the term is also used outside of the United States. 

Also, sexual intercourse does not = fuck. It's that fuck = sexual intercourse; in its literal sense anyway, since when people use the term...they are usually using it as profanity. That is also why I told you """"The Fuck article mentions sexual intercourse in its lead because it is especially relevant to the topic. However, the term 'fuck' is not especially relevant to the topic of sexual intercourse."""" 

I cannot see how this article is broken simply because it doesn't currently include """"fuck."""" But, like I stated, I don't mind adding it to the article. I'd rather see what others have to state on that matter first, however.   """,0.2857142857142857

Regarding you two non-Urantia Book reading nerds - Wazronk and Richiar - if you play games with what you don't know, then you're in for a fight. First of all, you two idiots, if you even bothered to look at the Urantia Readers-Intl website, you would know that it is not an advertising site, but a legitimate non-profit Urantia organization. Because you are not a member of the Urantia movement, and if you were, we would know who you are, you do not even know the history of the Urantia Readers-Intl - which by the way has a larger dedicated following then either the now falling apart Urantia Book Fellowship, and the failing Urantia Association International. 

For your edification, the Urantia Readers-Intl is the original Urantia Brotherhood from 1950, and the only group still holding the flame of the original Doctrine of Trust from its creation. The Urantia Book Fellowship created itself in 1989 as it broke off from the Urantia Brotherhood and the Urantia Foundation. The Foundation created another group called the Urantia Association International for some ridiculous reason, because they had the legal rights to the Urantia Brotherhood organization, and still do. Nevertheless, the Urantia Association International, as in the same direction as the Urantia Book Fellowship, fell into bad management and nefarious direction, and lost sight of the original Midwayer mandates. As such, the true remaining """"loyalist"""" migrated from the Urantia Brotherhood to the Urantia Association International. 

Over time the Urantia Association International, because of lack of true sagacity, was infiltrated by members of the rebel Urantia Book Fellowship organization. As such, the """"loyalist"""" members to the Urantia movement, many of whom where members of the Urantia Association of Florida, grabbed the torch and reorganized the original Urantia Brotherhood as the Urantia Readers-Intl. Because you two dummies are not a direct part of the Urantia movement, and again we say this because we would know who you are if you were - you do not know who is who and what is what. You don't even know that the Urantia Book Fellowship is a counter Urantia movement organization. But, you are obviously not true thinkers, but that is not the issue. 

The issue is that you two jerks keep deleting our external link from this section.

 Tie-break rules in basketball  

Can you give me the exact rules of this situation because I found this:

1) If 2 teams have the same record, the team that won the head to head game wins
the tie breaker.
2) If there are more than 2 teams with the same record, then the tie breaker will be
decided by the point difference in all games played. Please look at the chart below
for an example. All 3 teams ended with 2 wins and 2 loses.
# Team A Team B Team C1 Win + 2  Lose 15   Win +252Lose –10 Lose –9 Lose –33Win +5  Win +7  Lose –24 Lose –2  Win +10  Win + 11Diff. –5  –9  +31

So in this example, Team C would win the tie breaker with +31, Team A will be second
with -5, and Team B will be last with -9.
So, if this right , the standing in Euroleague 2009–10 is also correct.connect """,0.0

 Sockpuppet 

Re this block, I'm interested in the sequence of events. (I am not an administrator, so I don't know necessarily where to look, and I'm not sure what to look for either.) I followed this drama for a day. I was one of several people who warned the user that a block was likely forthcoming, which happened. The block was appealed several times until an admin unblocked (too soon, in my view but again, I'm not an admin). So shortly after the unblock, you identified the user as a sockpuppet. (Well, probably you blocked because of it.) So my question is this, as a relative newcomer - some time and effort could have been saved here - and maybe it was but I just don't know it. Can you shed a little light on the sequence of events after the unblock, or that were occurring elsewhere while the block/unblock was going on? (I'll watch your page or you can email me from mine.)

Hey Merzul, glad you have a sense of humor too.  There is actually a policy that admins are supposed to follow when a block might be controversial.  Obviosuly the admin in question and I have not seen eye to eye on the talk page of an extreemly controversial subject.  According to that policy he should have mentioned his intent to block me the admin notification board to let the other admins know prior top blocking me.  He did not do that.  He also is obligated to provide me with some specifics which he did not do.  And """"Final warning"""" suggests a previous warning had been given.  I would not be shocked if all my comments here get deleted and he uses WP:Soapbox as an excuse.  Oh well, what are you gonna do.  The only thing that bothers me is I cannot post anything on any of the admin boards to get a question or two answered and I cannot post on NCDave's talk page (he would appreciate the irony here I think).  He also deleted my comments on the talk page yet he leaves dozens of actual viscous attacks done by others there, I attacked no one so this selective enforcement makes me smile too.   I suspect the """"batman"""" comment sent him over the top (I'm Batman).  But we have one guy claiming he's a nuclear scientists and therefore evolution is wrong, another guy (who this Night dude is demonstrably sympathetic too) who claims he's a doctor and has proven evolution to be false, so I figured letting the cat out of the bag and admitting I'm batman was just as relevant (shhh mum's the word, my wife would kill me if she knew I was a crime fighter).  The talk page is obviously not a place for people to claim they can/have proven evolution to be wrong nor is it a good place to appeal to one's own authority.  But, in Nightguy's eyes I guess you can claim you're a nuclear scientist but claiming to be batman somehow violates some policy. 

To be clear, I'm seeing this as idiotically funny and not ranting against admins or Wikipedia.  Anyhow, here's to appreciating the occassional absurdity in life!  19:15""",0.14285714285714285

A warning for what, exactly? And, wow, where have I seen this crowd before...memo to everyone: I really don't care about anything. I don't edit for Wikipedia anymore, I edit for the subjects of articles near-exclusively. If this makes me disconnected from Wikipedia policies and standards, then I guess it's only a matter of time until it catches me out big time and I lose adminship. But until then, I'll be continuing along the same path I have for the last few months. If I get """"blocked"""" over something like this, it'll simply be a weekend in the middle of the week, which is something I've been screaming at my university and place of employment to implement anyways; Wikipedia is progressive, I guess, so it's always a possibility.

The vote was on the Campbell Case but the primary reason was the Russian Treaties:

""""Baldwin was careful to emphasise that the Treaties were the substance of his objections. Standfordham wrote to the King, on 7 October, 'I saw Mr Baldwin who, in reply to my question """"Do you want to turn the Government out?"""" said """"Yes, but not on the Campbell issue, but on the Russian Treaties which the country generally condemns."""" He sees no alternative to a dissolution; it has always been expected, some wished for it before now, though he is opposed to hastening the Government's fall. ...' ... And it is true that only in the House of Commons were Baldwin's strictures based on the Campbell case – at Newcastle on 2 October he congratulated MacDonald on the agreement, achieved at a conference in London, on the Dawes Plan for reparations, and then spent the rest of the speech alternately pouring scorn on the Labour party's subservience to its extremists, and tearing to pieces the Russian agreement. But the final debate on 8 October was a mean Parliamentary occasion. Two days before, in a meeting which was something of a suave qui puet, the Cabinet decided to take it as a vote of confidence, preferring to go out on the Campbell case to a defeat on the Russian Treaties which might give the left wing too much prominence.—Middlemas and Barnes, p. 273.

 Knowledge of Dipterocarpaceae  

Wow, I'm not even sure how to say that word. Have we recently crossed paths editing somewhere?   WikHead  

To be quite honest, I don't really know a lot about trees. I am however searching for a good central tree-related talk-page for you... somewhere where you might have a better chance of attracting other users with the knowledge you seek. If I can find a good link, I will most certainly post it here to your talk page. )   WikHead  

You're most certainly welcome! I'm guessing that the talk-page at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Forestry might be a really good place to find other users who can be of most help to you. I wish you the very best of luck with your updates. Have yourself a great day Curritocurrito, and happy editing! )   WikHead  

Hi Curritocurrito, thanks for your post at WikiProject Forestry. If you could elaborate a little more either there or at Talk:Dipterocarpaceae about what specific additions you might suggest for that article, that would be helpful. Thanks,   
Thanks for your reply. I suggest that you add your questions  """"why are they important? what habitat are they living? what animals eat their seeds? are they important economically? what minerals or grounds they need?""""  to the Talk:Dipterocarpaceae page. That will help others think about how they might contribute to that article.   
I don't get much time to edit Wikipedia pages, but am slowly trying to creat stubs for all the Dipterocarps and correct errors in existing stubs/article. If anyone is interested in editing these pages and needs access to primary sources - I have a reasonable collection of papers (mainly for SE Asia) and can send pdfs.
RE: the questions raised above
are they important economically? - they use to be the main timber export from SE Asia. I don't have figures for what % of the timber trade they account for now
what minerals or grounds they need?- variable - there is a high degree of habitat speacilsation. Some species only occur in Peatswamps, other in poor sand soils i.e. heath forests, others on rich clay soils.
what animals eat their seeds? - when they fruit, which varies from yearly in some of the Sri Lankan species to onces every x (2-16) years in some of the Borneo species - they are an important food source.

"It isn't about dumbing down, it's about the use of unambiguous language. The articles linked to by phenomena and artefact still leave the meanings of those words ambiguous. We don't have to stick religiously to the words used in the literature, particularly if, like with these, they are ambiguous in English. We should paraphrase if we need to, especially if it is a literal, rather than a meaning, translation from French as much of this appears to be. I think we need to forge a compromise between what is there now, and something  easier to grasp the true meaning of. I'll offer the following as a starter in this spirit:

Manufacturable and repeatable standards
Example physical standards of the base units used in the metric system capable of being accurately manufactured (known as realisable by the BIPM), ideally with reference to naturally occurring stable physical constants or phenomena rather than to a single existing physical object or artefacts. The BIPM publish a set of instructions for how to manufacture a reference standard for each of the base units. This is known as a mise en pratique in French, the primary language of the BIPM. Where practical at the time, the definitions of the base units were developed so that a suitably equipped laboratory would be able to construct an acceptably accurate reference standard without the need to compare it with an existing physical object, which may not be available locally. In practice, such such realisation is done under the auspices of what is known as a mutual acceptance arrangement (MAA).

Fair enough.

 a relevant example of paranoid group-attack, demonstrating bad faith: in the Bosnia and Herzegovina article, that country's regime is stated as """"Federal parliamentary republic"""" but without any references.

Also, what do you guys think about putting a quote from the book at the beginning of the article?  I think that might be a pretty good idea. -  
The article has been under some intense copyediting and scrutiny for preparation for a featured article. The plot summary should stay as it was. Quotes at the beginning of the article are not a good idea.   

I don't know if this is what you had in mind, but it's something I noticed a few years back. I first read TKAM in 1960 (I was 9) and since then I've read it at least once a year. It is a rare book that you can read over and over and still find new things. About 5 years ago I read the book and about half way down the first page I realized that in the universe that Harper Lee created in this book, the actual story is very simple and innocent - Scout is just explaining how Jem broke his arm. I have always plumbed the depths of this book, talked about the profundity, it's allusion, the allegory. But this reread I reckon I saw things through Scouts eyes and just listend to what she was saying. To paraphrase - When my brother Jem was 13 he broke his arm badly at the elbow - Then she tells the events that lead up to this happening. Might not be what you want, but I think it's fascinating!   

 Atticus=protagonist? 

The quote in the second paragraph identifies Atticus as the protagonist, but I was always under the impression that Scout was the protagonist, since all the events revolve around her perspective (I even said she was the protagonist in my addition to the Plot Summary section.  Am I wrong, or is the quote mistaken, or what?  What needs to happen in either case? It may not even be that big of a deal, but I'd like to get an answer.  -  
Atticus is not described as the protagonist by the article, but by a legal writer. He has been the subject of more papers in legal journals than any of the other characters in any sort of writing, so it bears pointing out that fame in the lead. I've had to remove information about Atticus per the suggestions of other editors who are assisting me in preparing the article for feature, and Atticus has his own article, that I shifted some information to.

""""While attending college, she wrote for campus literary magazines: Huntress at Huntingdon and the humor magazine Rammer Jammer at the University of Alabama. At both schools, she wrote short stories and other works about racial injustice, rarely mentioned topics on these campuses at the time.""""
 This sentence refers to """"topics"""", but one topic, racial injustice, is given.
 """"... which was/were rarely..."""" would be clearer, so """"mentioned"""" can't be read as a verb (which I did, when it occurred at the end of a line).

Thanks for the heads up, Outriggr. And thanks for reading it.   
In the film version Tom is shot while being transported to the prison, it is implied that he was killed and then the story about him running away was made up to hide the blatant murder.  In the book it is much less clear, even on my 5th reading this thought did not enter my mind (that he was murdered and the story was invented to hide the fact).  I think the interpretive twist in the film changes the impact considerably.  It highlights how society is on trial rather than racism.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 67.159.71.32

66.185.85.80's rant

Presently, we are witnessing  an open war against Croatian Dinaric culture.  Croatian Left often portrays this culture as """"primitive"""" and """"rural"""" (even """"fashist"""") being  in  service of Conservative HDZ party. Croatian writer Predrag Raos, for instance, """"performed"""" on gusle instrument in Zagreb on several occasions this year (2004) with only one intention - to ridicule the same instrument and its rich poetic tradition.
 
Another """"apostle"""" of Croatian Left - Miljenko Jergović - refers to his political opponents on the Right as """"gusle players"""". 

Some even claim the Serbian origin of Croatian Dinaric culture following the line of traditional greater Serbian propagabda (all štokavian people and their culture are Serbian). However, Croatian Dinaric folklore and its rich gusle heritage is primarly Croatian. Dalmatian costal region has been historically associated with this culture. For example, the first written document about the most popular folk hero of traditional gusle music, Marko Kraljević, is associated with Dalmatian island Hvar through Petar Hektorović's book """"Ribanje i ribarsko prigovaranje"""", 1568). Also, the first historical document which mentioned gusle player and its instrument originated in  Dubrovnik (1547). Even now, a contemporary Croatian writer (born in Dubrovnik) Stijepo Mijović Kočan tells us a story about his uncle (also from Dubrovnik area) who could memorize numerous gusle songs (Stijepo Mijović Kočan: Gusle, Glasnik, May 25, 1992, p. 42). Dubrovnik is also a home of Anica Begin (born Kalafatović, 1816), a daughter of famous gusle player Ante. Although illiterate, she was able to recite by heart an immense number of gusle songs, some of which were recorded in antology of Croatian folk poetry. 
 
Not far from Dubrovnik, another coastal city - Makarska – was  also a bastion of Croatian gusle music. Actually, this region could be considered the Capital of all Croatian gusle players. This Mediterranean area  also gave birth to  Andrija Kačić Miošić (18th century Catholic priest), who is  viewed as the father of all gusle players of Croatia and beyond. To honour Kačić's work, Ivan Meštrović, the most famous Croatian sculptor, built a sculpture in America showing Kačić in his priestly clothes  playing gusle instrument.  

In addition to Kačić, Makarska Littoral produced a great many other followers of Croatian gusle music. According to dr. fra Karlo Jurišić (who quotes the work of Croatian folklorist Stipan Banović), Zaostrog alone  produced a great number of gusle players starting with Stipan Kosović-Kudrić (1771-1818) and culminating with the most known Mate Banović – Trliš (1844-1915).  As for Dalmatian women, they didn't play gusle (it's    considered   a male activity only), yet they were actively involved in spreading  gusle music  by  imitating its sound. 

Olinko Delorko, the researcher of  Dalmatian  folk poetry in the 1960s, states in his book Ljuba Ivanova (1969) that most of his Dalmatian folk poetry collection was obtained by  women, especially the ones from the island of Hvar. 

The Zadar Littoral also witnessed strong gusle tradition. English writer Maude M. Holbach, travelling through Zadar region in the first decade of 20th century  states in her book  """"Dalmatia: The Land Where East Meets West"""" that the gusle was the national instrument of the region. As for Dinaric dances, which took place at markets and certain festivals, they  are very picturesque and interesting, and worth going a long way to see, being a survival of ancient custom probably unique in Europe (p.54)

This admiration for Dinaric folk music, particularly gusle, was seen in both Dalmatian Litteral and  Hinterland.  Matija Murko, the researcher of this literary/music forms,  had reported   that during his trips  through Dalmatia in the 1930s, he saw a child, barely three years old playing gusle (Eduard Osredečki: “Hrvatske narodne junačke pjesme”, Željezno-Beč, p. 9)

Now, lets  take a look at  the names of some Dalmatian sports clubs and organizations: Hajduk, Junak, Gusar, Alkar, Uskok, sinjska alka, etc. What do they have in common? Of course, their names refer to the heroic gusle tradition of the region. 

Having this in mind, one wonders why this proud Croatian heritage has become almost  extinct.  Why do we have so few gusle players today ? Is it a  result of  unavoidable urbanization  of  modern Croatian society where peasant culture is being considered  inferior to global  rock 'n' roll  culture ? If so, why has tamburitza music of Northern Croatia  gained wide acceptance from the Croatian establishment while its  Dinaric counterpart (gusle music) is looked upon with suspicion and  open hatre",0.0

It did not submit for the year 2011, which resulted in the Judicial Panel sanctioning the club a total of £160,000 for various breaches of its Articles of Association, and also imposing a transfer embargo which has been subsequently set aside after the Court of Session ruling by Lord Glennie.” That is – transferring old to new is not the same as a new club pitching up and wanting in. .

My only mistake, assuming your edit is a good one, was to use the wrong syntax so as to make the headers too bold, giving undue weight. A minor mistake to correct, as you did for us in a few minutes. This is the nature of Wikipedia; easy to make mistakes, but easy to correct them.

The sites I deleted from the external links, as you will see if you go to through the history a little and check them were all against guidelines: One didn't work, the site's html was screwed up, obviously delete it. Four of the top five links were to sites that promote Khalifa's unique claim that the the Quran has a mathematical structure based on the number 19 and that this proves two of the Quran's verses are man-made. These sites are obvious Khalifa followers, one has USI copyright assertions in the footnotes? Two or three more were just peoples own POV sites with free hosts and all that, nothing of any stature whatsoever. These were removed so that there is one link to the 19ers main site, and all the other links that were any good at all. The only other change I made was to add descriptions in parenthesis so people would know what each link actually led to.",0.0

 Secrets from the grave 

This is pure speculation on my part, but I imagine the exhumation of Paula's grave would have been carried out under conditions of great secrecy and with some degree of security. Nonetheless, I wonder if DNA obtained from any remains might yield a clue as to the identity of the grandfather she shared with her infamous brother. Would anyone be interested enough to do the research? It would surely be only of academic interest, but even so...

I also find it a rather odd co-incidence that these mysterious documents have appeared, apparently within weeks of the exhumation. Is there any proof that the documents are genuine? I still recall the fiasco of the so called """"Hitler diaries"""" some years ago. Perhaps the time has come to stop looking.

 Standardized register 

Croatian (hrvatski jezik) is a standardized register of the Serbo-Croatian language... - to claim that is simply not true, because """"standard"""" Croatian is not only Croatian language. 

Standard language in Croatia is Serbo-Croatian, or batter to say - some form of West Serbian language. - so there is no dispute about that. However Croatian language, real Croatian language (one you can easily find in thousands of books, epics, poems...) has nothing to do with Serbian language. That is something no one seems to understand.

Croatian language is almost extinct language which haves no Institution to govern its development. Today in Croatia, Croatian language is forbidden, and is used only in everyday conversations but not by public media, government... or other official institutions.

The term vukopis is used to describe """"violence"""" done to actual language by changing Croatian language to almost unrecognized form by political force and totalitarian Yugoslav régime. That Serbian (better to say """"Vukovian"""", because vukovians are Croats as well) violence is the only reason why today's """"standard"""" Croatian language is almost the same as Serbian language altogether.  

Kratko i jezgrovito rečeno: prošlost je jezika hrvatskoga sjajna, sadašnjost mračna, budućnost neizvjestna... U djelima se (ranijih) književnika zrcali pravo biće jezika hrvatskoga, pravopisa i porabe jezične. Sve je to obrazbeno blago u XX. st. odvrženo i poslano u ropotarnicu poviesti... Budući nam je izvorni književni izraz hrvatski iz mozga bez traga izpran, ... unatoč mnogostoljetnoj svojoj poviesti, hrvatski je jezik danas lišen prošlosti. - Bulcsú László

Briefly and succinctly said: the past of Croatian language is a great, the present bleak, the future uncertain... In the works of the (early) writers reflects true being of Croatian language, spelling and precise use of language. All this is slightly transformed by the twentieth century, overthrew and sent to the dustbin of history ... Since our original Croatian literary expression has been from our brain washed without trace ... Despite its many-century history, Croatian language is today devoid of his past.- Bulcsú László

This is the stand of preeminent Croatian linguists, so the article needs to express this, and say that """"standard"""" Croatian language is Serbo-Croatian, but Croatian language isn't.

 High Times Magazine mistake? 

I'm reading the December 2009 issue of High Times, and on page 14, there's a mini section about Patrick Swayze smoking marijuana.

Quote:

A source close to Patrick Swayze told the National Enquirer that medical marijuana is improving the actor's health. Swayze, who is undergoing chemotherapy treatments for pancreatic cancer, says that smoking pot has enabled him to gain weight because it has helped reduce nausea, allowing him to """"keep his food down"""".

Not necessary. The """"debate"""" over global warming is long over. The """"debate"""" was a farce created by the people who wanted to pretend that it didn't exist. There is no reason to cater to them. It's an insult to honesty and good science.  

If we're talking about this part:
It is the largest single source of fuel for the generation of electricity world-wide, as well as one of the largest sources of carbon dioxide emissions, which is considered the primary cause of global warming. Coal is extracted from the ground by coal mining, either underground mining or open pit mining (surface mining).

Amount of coal remaining
""""At the current global total energy consumption of 15 terawatt,[30] there is enough coal to provide the entire planet with all of its energy for 57 years.""""  This sentence is not supported, and ignores the growth in coal consumption trends, and is therefore unencyclopedic. Please support it per WP:RS or it will be removed shortly.   
Actually the only reason it is there is because someone else had the questionable statement that coal could provide the entire planet with all of its energy for 600 years, which was based on the typographical error that has been fixed. Feel free to remove. The source was simple arithmetic of the numbers given.

The article does not say anywhere that coal is the largest source, it says it is one of the largest sources. Coal and oil are so close to each other that it is not easy to definitively say that either is the largest. Coal is also increasing much faster than oil, which is likely to be declining soon, if it hasn't already begun to decline.  

 Question about units 
The article sometimes measures coal consumption in tonnes (metric tons, one tonne = 1000 kg) and sometimes in tons, which could be either the short ton (2000 lb) or the long ton (2200 lb).  (See the section, """"Coal as Fuel"""".)   Is this change intentional or simply a typo?

I do not see why you are defending stand point who are not at all being made by you, nor why you feel the urge to respond for another one than you. 
I think that the person concern, Storm Rider, is grown up enough to do so on its own. 
Unless next time I am under attack, you take the relay and answer that one for me as well. It could be interesting. 
If you have something to say, say it so, but use your own words idea and language instead of making a copy paste of my entire edit, as you have nothing at all to add to it and in fact seems clearly to don't know what to say. 
So do the wisest, just shut up! 
It is in fact evident that you do not have understood one word of what has been sayed, and as you can see, repeating it indefinitely like rot speach, is not going to give you the ability to understand. 
All you do is agressing agressing personal attacks and agressing. 
Try to use half as much of your energy to understand what this is about and I am sure that you might see some light. 
I do not think that my statements can be make clearer than they already are and that your reaction, more than a physical unhability to comprehend, expose your reticence at accepting things you just dont want to accept. 
You cannot accuse me of talking in circle when you are the one doing so as it can be very clearly seen in your edit. 
As for you stupid accusation of me not being >sophie, what about you? Are you VAL? or are you rama? or are you DGL626, there is a lot of nick name on wiki, and all of them cover up a real name. 
They are all a pseudonym, meaning they are anonymous. 
So if I take the name """"anonymous"""" as a pseudo, I will be as hiding and as showing as you are, because at the end, in both case it is a pseudonym with nothing to do with the person real name and identity.

So what are you trying to proove, except the fact that you were unable to figure what I just told you on your own? 
I had a name, this name seems now to be unavailable, and I dont feel to make it again or take another. 
Following wiki rules all are equal on wiki, old rats as well as newbees (hahaha) and even arb com and board members and admi are as equal as usual wikipedian, thought they have much more power than them and abuse of this power constantly without bad conscience, and have learn to twist and bend all wiki rules behond recognition, so who are you trying to fool with your wiki neutrality and wiki equality, who is wikis first rule? 
It is all a lie. 
How can you claim equality with another if you have more power than this other and power on this person and can exclude this person from the group? 
It isnt equality it is power struggle. 
It is adversity, and supremacy and group pressure as here. 
WIKI is oppression and extinction of the freedom of expression, it is so corrupt that not one admi found it disturbing nor strange to banish or revert a user edit to impose his own point of view, on the sacro sankt name of wikis neutrality and equality!

HA HA! 
Make me laught, but dont think you can trick me at believing such lies. 
Please, in the future, avoid using words that you do not fully understand, as """"logic"""". 
For your knowledge english is one of the easiest language to learn so stop affirming stuff like that gratuitiously, do some research first. 
I speak 9 languages: 
English, danish, french, german, norvegian, swedish, occitan, latin, greek, and geek!

5 of them fluently, the others as pocket use. Like german I can read a book but I dont have spoken it for some years so it might take me 2 3 weeks to get back the rythm. 
As a nativ american your knowledge of foreign languages is zero, maybe hightened if you are a mormon who have been on mission outside the US, but you have absolutely no experience of the process of learning new languages. In europe from age 11 we choose between 3 languages: english german and spanish, at age 13, we have to chose another one, and choose between english german, spanish italian russian, from age 15, when we begin graduate school, we have to take another one, and chose between those named before and also chineese and modern american, and a dialect or local language, and can also take hebrew. 
2 to 3 languages are part of the compulsory pensum. 
I also took extra english dialect as the one spoken by semi natives in australia, and english dialect spoken in India. 
That was for learning a foreign language, sister. 
Oh! I forgot, you are a man, difficult to know with a pseudo! 
I found it superfluent but wi",0.0

Wikipedia is collapsing under its own weight. There are too many users, too much public acess and too many dummies trying to run the sight that don't have a clue what they're doing or where their diapers are. I have frequented this sight as a registered user for many years, and although some expansions are nice, it is headed downwards.

"Look at what the bastards just did to my wikipedia page 
It also shows what their mentality is like toward people with disabilities; These are real nasty and slimey hired political liars and trolls; and you can bet your butt some of their edits are right up above and in the article itself.  
http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:65.95.151.166&oldid;=68340985

This reference (above) to offensive vandalism was removed by the 72.139.185.19 vandal ( looks to me like obvious vandalism )Has the vandal been blocked yet does anyone know?  

 Administrative review request 
I am very concerned about the removal of edits above from this talk page. I especially feel it is very important that since  72.139.185.19 continues to edit this article regularly that the community know about his use of a template which ridicules disabled children. Some acts of vandalism are so offensive, e.g. extremely prejudicial/racial name calling, that they must be known about by the community rather than just swept under the carpet. Think Mel Gibson and if there was attempts to censor reporting of what he said just because he apologized. Wikinews means no censorship.  
I agree and 72.139.185.19 should not be allowed to continue deleting comments relating to his offensive and blockable template. An editor who would use a template making fun of retarded children, even once, has no place here and is not welcome,imo. 72.139.185.19 has had so much editing on this article and discussion that I agree with  that a review of the deletions from this discussion page is desperately needed.",0.0

"Is Deepak the ruler of the world? 

Let me give you people who love this guy/girl Deepak....An idea of what Deepak is like....He must be some really unhappy person......i promoise you this is what it is like in dealing with Deepak. 

I bring up an issue where im asking why an article does not have more info, or about editing an article, or about taking something out of an article. 

And Deepak wont allow me to make edits. 

So I give Deepak examples and information and trying to back up my edits are legit. 

And Deepak ignores my logic and doesnt give me alot of logic as to why my info is not valid then 

So I try to figure out why Deepak is being so strcit. I remind him that i backed up what i said. That i had information that was logical. And why my edits are good. 

And Deepak calls me a troll and insults me and accuses me of being a nazi lover or something

So I answer every insult, every accustation , and every put down that Deepak gives me. And then i remind him of why my edits are valid.

And Deepak ignores most of what i write and continues to call me a troll. Or a nazi lover. Or other insults. 

I then get annoyed and ask Deepak why is he ignoring most of my logic that i write down? Why does he pick and choose what he wants to answer? Why does he not give me logic in return? 

And Deepak wont reply . 

I then ask other users about making edits and asking them about my logic and giving them my reasons as to why my edits are valid. And some answer and some agree and some dont. 

And Deepak all of a sudden starts responding again....with logic? No....with answers? no....with reasoning? no....with information? no....he tells the other users that im a troll and a nazi and pro India then . 

I then answer all of Deepaks insults. I remind him of why i want edits to be made. I give him my information as to why  my edits are valid then. 

And Deepak goes back calling me a troll, and a nazi, and a pro India dude. 

And this kind of stuff goes on and on and on...you get the idea.....he ignores information you give him. He picks and chooses what he wants to answer. And he doesnt even answer the logic you give him sometimes. But he wastes his time in name calling, and insluts, and putting you down then. 

So then after a while i get annoyed. And i remind him how things got this bad between us. I type and type and type and type just like i am now. 

And Deepak ignores most of what i typed. 

Many times i write him these long replies where i answer all his points, where i tell him why its wrong for him to insult me and put me down, and why its wrong for him to ignore the information i have as to why i want to make an edit, or whatever it is im bringing up then.....and no matter how much i write....even if i write these long replies to him then....even if i answer every point he brings up....he usually either ignores most of what i wrote down....or....he picks and chooses what he wants to answer.....or.....he just responds back by calling me a troll, or accusing me of being pro nazi or something, or accusing me of ignoring his points (which is so not true cus i respond to pretty much everything he says then), or accusing me of not understanding what he is telling me, or just accusing me of being pro India then (which I am) or just insulting me, or just name calling me, or just putting me down. 

So then after a while i get so annoyed cus he's this a guy here then with me now, and so i start to call him names. I call him a dictator. I call him the ruler of wikiepdia. And I tell him how he ignores my points. 

And then Deepak tells me how i cant call him names, and how i cant throw mud at him, and how im breaking wikipedia rules

So then I ask him how comes its ok for him to name call me and i cant? How come its ok for him to throw mud at me but I cant then? How come its ok for him to break Wikipedia's rules but I can't then? 

And Deepak has no logical answer....or....he won't respond to those questions that I ask him then . Or he just ignores what i ask him, and goes back to accusing me of being a troll, or acting like im a pro nazi or something then , or just insult's me in general then......

So then I get more annoyed and call him thing's like a dictator, which as you can see here with our history, this is how he acts.....isn't it true?.....he ignores most of my points and picks and chooses what he wants to answer.....sometimes he won't even answer you at all.....and sometime's he just insults you then . So it's logical if get annoyed and call him a dicator right?

Wrong....Deepak then holds it against you that your name calling him...and threaten's to block you, or report you, or he just tel",0.14285714285714285

Hello. Your account has been granted the """"reviewer"""" userright, allowing you to review other users' edits on certain flagged pages.

Its continued use is still being discussed by the community, you are free to participate in such discussions. Many articles still have pending changes protection applied, however, and the ability to review pending changes continues to be of use.

Reviewers can review edits made by users who are not autoconfirmed to articles placed under level 1 pending changes and edits made by non-reviewers to level 2 pending changes protected articles (usually high traffic articles). Pending changes was applied to only a small number of articles, similarly to how semi-protection is applied but in a more controlled way for the trial. The list of articles with pending changes awaiting review is located at Special:OldReviewedPages.

For the guideline on reviewing, see Wikipedia:Reviewing. Being granted reviewer rights doesn't grant you status nor change how you can edit articles even with pending changes. The general help page on pending changes can be found here, and the general policy for the trial can be found here.

Things like this need attention:
The article on the thyroid gland was labelled as part of the """"endocinal jubachina system"""" for two and a half years. The article on Birth weight is inexplicably called Birth Mass, nobody refers to """"birth mass"""" it's also written poorly.

 Definition of witchcraft/Wicca 

I have some problems with this section. It's all very nice to be able to laugh and say """"you're wrong on all these points"""", but in fact this section is misrepresenting Wicca just as much as the Harry-haters.
The heading itself seems to imply that witchcraft and Wicca are synonymous. Wicca is merely one variety of modern witchcraft.
Wiccans commune with the dead and the spirit world. At Halloween (or Samhain), for example, we invite the spirits of our ancestors and deceased loved ones to return and share our warmth and companionship for an evening. Extensive spirit contact by Wiccans (via ouija board and channeling) is recounted in A Voice in the Forest by Jimahl diFiosa, an Alexandrian High Priest.
Sorcery: well, Wiccans definitely perform magic. The word 'sorcery' has a sinister sound to it, which perhaps doesn't fit with Wicca so well, but if it merely means 'performing magic', then certainly.
Occult symbology: this is merely a catch-all phrase for anything that looks a bit 'occult', isn't it? Well, Wicca is very definitely 'occultism', since it deals with magic and the hidden parts of reality. And yes, Wiccans use occult symbols, such as zodiacal signs.
Curses are of course forbidden in Wicca, as is all malicious or harmful magic.
Demon posession: Whoever accused Wiccans of practicing demon posession is pulling a swift one. Wiccans practice what could loosely be called """"posession"""": calling our God or Goddess into the body of a priest or priestess. I guess this is fairly similar to what Christians call """"being filled with the spirit"""", but if you happen to consider the Wiccan gods to be demons (and of course they're demons, aren't they, since any deity other than Jehovah is a demon), then you could term this """"demon possession"""", feeling only a tinge of guilt at your verbal chicanery.

The real reason why Harry Potter has nothing to do with Wicca is because Harry Potter is fantasy, presented in a manner that has virtually no resemblance to the reality of modern witchcraft, whether it be Wicca or any other variety. How many kids watch the Power Rangers and decide they want to enter law enforcement as a ranger when they grow up? The Texas Rangers, just like the Power Rangers, wear uniforms, fight bad guys, protect law and order, have headquarters and so on. The parallels are all there, but any rational person will immediately discern the vast differences.

I don't think we need to misrepresent our religion, simply because some people get the flutters whenever the words 'magic' or 'occult' are mentioned. Lets show a bit of backbone, rather than trying to turn our faith into what we think Christians want it to be! ★ """,0.0

Ms Gundagai, normally I would be thrilled to be the centre of so much attention (so far all your edits, except those to your userpage, have been devoted to me), but article talk pages are for discussing the article, not for making personal attacks on other users. If you wish to give me feedback, I would be most interested to read it. The appropriate place for such postings is my userpage, not article or project space.
If you truly object to editors """"fiddling...and inteferring with some else's words,"""" then you might want to consider whether Wikipedia is the right place for you. Every time you make an edit, you acknowledge acceptance that your edits may be edited any number of times by any number of people. At the bottom of each edit page is this statement: """"If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed by others, do not submit it.""""
I strongly caution you about continuing to make personal attacks on other users. The community condemns personal attacks, and should you choose to continue making them, it will result in further and longer range blocks. It's very easy to avoid such blocks by simply commenting on article content instead of editors. I'm sure we can all work together constructively and productively if we refrain from making comments about other users.
I am very pleased that you now have an account and I think this is a sign of good faith on your behalf. So thankyou for that. I hope we are able to get these issues resolved so you may be able to enjoy contributing to Wikipedia. Sarah Ewart (Talk) """"""",0.14285714285714285

There's several reasons. First, the rationale for the image says """"To display iconic image in relevant context"""" for the purpose. Having the image in the infobox does not place the image in the relevant context. Having it in the section titled """"1988 scandal - Swaggart's confession and fallout"""" does.

Unjustified protection of an article
I would like to get an explanation as to why the article Bulgarian vocabulary was blocked by you after User:Peter Isotalo repeatedly moved the content of the article Bulgarian lexis to the new name, Bulgarian vocabulary, without justification and without giving a plausible reason for that. Let's look at the meanings of the two words in the first online dictionary I came upon (it happened to be wordreference [www.wordreference.com ]):

Vocabulary: (1)a language user's knowledge of words. (2)the system of techniques or symbols serving as a means of expression (as in arts or crafts); """"he introduced a wide vocabulary of techniques. (3)a listing of the words used in some enterprise 

Lexis: (1)all of the words in a language. (2) all word forms having meaning or grammatical function:

As the article refers to the whole body of words in the Bulgarian language, I would like to ask you: which word refers better to the meaning of the article, vocabulary or lexis? Don't tell me - because the dictionary has already stated it explicitly, it is lexis!!!

Ok, the reason for the need of creation of an article on him is that now he has been appointed as United nation's Special advisor/envoy on Global Education  http://www.livemint.com/Politics/7AmAud6bJ1of9J1fnfNfPN/Malalas-father-named-UN-advisor-on-education.html and also Pakistan’s education attache in Birmingham. http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/Europe/Diplomatic-role-for-Malala-s-dad/Article1-984617.aspx So IMHO, this makes him very much notable figure and as he has been nominated for the post of UN envoy, a page on him is feasible and needed. 

Kindly advice. Thanks. Meanwhile wish you all a very happy New Year 2013..:) With best regards,",0.0

confused state of """"medieval"""" connections
The questions are the following:
did George V actually adopt the Jerusalem cross, and if so, what is our evidence for this?
does this have anything to do with the flag shown for Sivas (Savasto) in the Spanish """"Book of All Kingdoms""""? If so, what is the connection,  seeing as Sivas was never part of the kingdom of Georgia?
when the current flag was designed in the early 1990s, were the people who made the flag aware of these supposed medieval connections? Or were they simply pointed out later by vexillologists? What is the earliest reference to the post-1991 flag?  Adoption by the  United National Movement dates to c. 1999.  Kldiashvili wrote a """"History of the Georgian heraldry"""" in 1997.

It seems to me, to use a Christian metaphor, that you cast the first stone.  Basically my attitude here is that it is not only good men who should be identified as Christians.  If someone self-identifies as a train enthusiast that is good enough for me.  If there is a Wikipedia category for train enthusiasts then he should be included.  The category is for """"train enthusiasts"""" not """"good train enthusiasts"""".  We have no need to examine the purity of his enthusiasm.   

Besides, you are on a slippery slope.  In one Western democracy yesterday it was announced that more than 180,000 abortions happened last year.  That country is run by one who identifies himself very publicly as a Christian.  But he never speaks out against abortion.  He also took his country to war on false pretenses (he deliberately told lies) and in that war 20,000 innocent civilians have died who would not have died if there had been no war.  Using your argument Tony Blair cannot be identified as a Christian.   

But I do not want to use your argument.  Nor do I think we should.  (But even if we use your argument we cannot see into Tariq Aziz's soul.)  That you (presumably another Christian) re-act with distaste that Aziz belongs to the same club is not the point.  Create a category for """"saintly christians"""" is a possibility (although it would be horribly POV) and maybe you should exclude Azis from that category.   """,0.0

There is no widely agreed-upon definition of terrorism. Let's hold off on that for now until we get a number of news organizations calling it that.  (Talk) 
It might, but it's too soon to say. We don't know the motivations of the shooter (though I can't help but wonder if it's a tea party sympathizer taking to those """"second amendment remedies"""").

Terrorism would seem to be a loaded term to add to any article.

No  because Wikipedia utilizes editorial scrutiny when an article is tainted with undocumented allegations and inappropriate personal sentiment.

As long as the public record is noted with specific references, the strengths of the article should outweigh its disadvantages.

Apart from Raymond's unquestionable level within her profession, as evidenced by her non-PR work with Sony, et al., one of the main reasons to allow the entry is to chronicle the extraordinary and documented pitch of sexual harassment that was directed against her on the internet and within the gaming community once she became a spokesperson for Ubisoft. Hers has been a unique situation, and sexual harassment is an important issue because of her status as a pioneering woman in the gaming field.

There were two main reasons why I closed: The solid arguments WP:SALAT and WP:NOT#DIRECTORY. """"Keep - but remove red links"""" isn't really a solid rationale; it didn't really address the two arguments above. The second keep was stronger, but again didn't really address the points above, and was more along the lines of WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS. As We66er said, removing the redlinks would leave a list of five, which defeats the object of a """"list"""". On the counter side of that argument, redlinks show potential for new articles, but when there are so many redlinks, there is no need for such a list. There were many items on the list, yet only a handful were referenced, and as another said, one of the organisations on that list had been deleted previously through AfD. The strongest keep therefore was WP:STAND, but that was struck as a result of misinterpretation. This is the full reason for my close. However, deleting admins don't generally say any more than """"keep"""" or """"delete"""" in their closing statement, unless 1) there is a specific reason for the delete and/or 2) it was a decision that could cause controversy.

 Dubious claims about clearly non-transgenderd people 

This article lists a whole bunch of people whos transgender status is clearly wrong and others for whom it is highly speculative.  This isn't a list of people who """"kinda, sorta, there's a small chance, maybe"""" are transgender.

The ones who cross-dressed for some nefarious/deceptive purpose and not as a life style choice clearly can not be classified as transgender and should be removed from the article completely.  The fact that mythological figures such as Achilles were even added in the first place says a lot about the POV pushing of the people who supported it.  The only mythological one who might be considered transgenderes is Guan Yin.  The real life figures who did it to disguise themselves to avoid something (e.g. military service) or even to get into something where women are discriminated against.  They did it for deceptive purposes as well, so they can't really be considered transgendered.

The pope one is laughable and definitely should be removed.  The one about Joan of Arc is based exclusively on an accustion from a unreliable source.  If they accused her of being a witch, should we have included her in a list of witches too?  Also, I'd like to see an authoritative source showing that she was even accused of it as it seems that it's most Wikipedia ripped sites and LGBT websites that site that as fact.

And what are """"transvestite tendencies"""" in reference to Ed Wood?  You need to start citing sources or I'm just going to start deleting them.  That goes mainly for the historical and mythological figurse section.

Maxwell Klinger wasn't even a real transvestite, he only did that so he'd get a section 8 and get kicked out of the army.  Anyone who watched the show knows he would try all kinds of crazy stuff to get kicked out under the guise of being mentally ill.  This phrase describing the character is also very odd: """"Although a transvestite, he loudly denied any charges of homosexuality.""""  What's the association between the two?

Also, it appears they're using a warped definition of transgender here.  I've never heard a definition that would automatically include cross-dressers as if that automatically means they identify with the opposite gender rather than just enjoying the clothes.  I'm sorry, but this overly broad and incorrect definition of transgender is obviously an attempt just to make the list as long as possible.

Instead, you choose to act like a self-appointed wikipedia police, running about throwing up the blue flags of WP rules and being a generally obnoxious person with no real use. Instead of actually contributing useful original edits to articles you seem to think this is the old Newpedia where people are expected to submit edits for your approval. If too many others take the same tac WP will collapse into dross. You violate every rule in the book of which you accuse others. You are a mean spirited, very angry person that drives away editors with your sarcastic responses and general high-handed behavior. I suspect you have no real special knowledge of any of the articles upon which you squat like a vulture waiting tear apart others creative edits. You really need to crack a book and study up on a subject or two and find an article you feel needs rewriting and to straighten out the too turgid, redundant writing that exists here on WP. Stop trying to act like you are an administrator and grow up.

At a time when WP needs more editors, particularly female, you with your coarse, rude behavior is the last thing WP needs. You are, to summarize it, a net negative.

"""a liberal person's article that has personal blog criticism, and yet you haven't removed any of the criticism. There is clearly a quality difference between Media Matters analysis and Moorewatch.com, but nonetheless you seem fixated on one. Why is that?  

I am looking at an article that used to have criticism on it, but two user's pulled MM off and then removed the controversy section.  

I quote from WP:RS, """"The websites and publications of political parties and religious groups should be treated with caution, although neither political affiliation nor religious belief is in itself a reason not to use a source."""" I'd like to point out Media Matters is not a political party nor religious organization. Can anyone give a reason for the material they disagree with and want removed?  
Sure I find lots of reasons.  But one of the biggest is your comment that """"Hannity is a moron.""""  It proves that you are biased and incapable of putting together a NPOV article. 

I asked for reasons why you consider it unreliable. Also I never insulted Hannity I added a link to well-traffic Hannity criticism site. Moreover, I told you this already and you still want to falsely claim I insulted Hannity. There is a discussion on Media Matters on WP:RS. Why you don't consider it reiable? Do you think those clips of Hannity speaking are fake?  

 Terri Schiavo 

During the Terri Schiavo controversy, two of Schiavo's nurses appeared on Hannity and Colmes to argue that Schiavo was not brain dead. Talk show host and actor Harry Shearer obtained a video tapeHannity and Colmes video where Hannity can be heard coaching the nurses on how to respond to Alan Colmes's questions. He told them to respond """"I'm just here to tell you what I saw"""", no matter what Colmes asked. After the segment, Hannity can be heard saying """"We got the points out...But you did great, both of you"""". Should this be included?  

 Lolreverting 

Don't blindly revert things like fixing fair use images. I see no reason to discuss Fred Phelps on this page. He is more than adequately discuessed on his own page. In fact, I see no reason for most of this page to exist. Are the controvercies notable at all?  

I agree. Moreover, if the reader wants to learn more they go to the footnote. All material Getaway added is on there.  
Well, if the criticism of Media Matters is going to be on the page, which I don't agree many of these so-called controversies should even be there, but if it is going to be there then the Phelps's Democrat, liberal background needs to be pointed out because Media Matters is attempting to argue that Hannity was completely off base, which he wasn't.  The information will be placed in the article in a NPOV way it will not be placed there at all.  And the way that the Phelps information keeps getting removed is simply POV. 
 Phelps being or not being a Democrat has nothing at all to do with Sean Hannity.  
That is a incorrect conclusionary statement.  You did not provide an argument to back up your personal opinion.  So thank you for your personal opinion, but it is not controlling.

Etiquette
Your statement """"I keep my conviction that I'm on the truth: that you two are members of some racist organization"""" on this edit directed toward User:Dark Tichondrias  is an accusation that two users are racists, making it against Wikipedia's policy on etiquette.  Wikipedia's policy on etiquette suggests to not accuse other users of being racist. 
WP:Wikiettiquete says:
Terms like """"racist,"""" """"sexist"""" or even """"poorly written"""" make people defensive. This makes it hard to discuss articles productively. If you have to criticize, you must do it in a polite and constructive manner.
This seems to be the issue of dispute. Yet racism is at the heart of this discussion, specially because DT and Thulean are percieved by all the rest as people with such an agenda. 
I'm pondering to start a project called WP:Honesty: Say things clear (without falling in insults), don't hide in word games, don't make threats that make no sense (bravados), don't edit capriciously ignoring the discussion, etc. Play fair and demand others to do the same. 
You pretend that I'm making ad hominem attacks, yet I'm just pointing out who's misbehaving and why. Something that is obvious to all, including you two.
If you would be even minimally sincere you would not be trying to corner me against arbitrarily selected Wikipolicies but you would have protested your innocence, first of all. You are just playing legalism.
If you want me to refrain from denouncing your behaviour and your agenda the least your could do is to  is to protest your innocence, to explain your reasons, to pretend at least that you are not racist. But you only make attacks ad hominem against my honesty and sincerity.
Keep it that way. I don't mind.  

Personal Attacks

Please refrain from personal attacks which you made in Talk:White_people. Or next time you will be reported to WP:DP.  
I am not making any personal attacks. I honestly think you are a nazi (or close equivalent, if you want to dwell in the small letter and word twists). You haven't even bothered in denying it, so why should I think otherwise. 
If you think that stating that is a personal attack, please say why. I don't think that openly declaring the (apparent) truth is any personal attack but just that: stating facts, so we can discuss honestly.
What is being discussed in that article's talk page is largely ideological and some people of certain ideology (you and DarkTichondrias) are trying to manipulate the participative process of Wikipedia in your favor, editing ignoring the consensus. I honestly believe it is my duty to fight such behaviour and defend the neutrality of Wikipedia. And I will do it.  
If you still arent satisfied, you can ask a request for investigation, but I must warn it can well backfire.  

Of course I wont dignify your silly personal attacks with a response. And you repeated your personal attack with your response. I'll be reporting you.

Wikilinks
How territorial of you to undo all my wikilinks just so you could put them all back yourself. Some of them you didn't even put back right, hence the friendly notice left on your talk page; you still have some DAB links left. How is this clearer and who does that? Who will purposely undo what a previous editor didwhich actually helped the pagejust so they could micromanage a page and do it all over again themselves... but worse. I don't get it. I followed your dance-style-on-the-card rule and I added wikilinks which weren't there before. We were on the SAME SIDE Snow. We both want a better page. Pay attention. If you were thinking clearly instead of obsessing over a page you think belongs to you, all you would have had to do after I originally added the wikilinks is fix mambo, tango, b-boying, and kalinka (they all linked to disam pages). Then everything would have linked fine. Instead you undo everything I linked. Then you (re)add links all back and end up creating more disambiguation links than what existed before. You even linked to some pages which aren't even helpful. Example: you changed """"Tap dance"""" back to """"Tap dancing"""" and """"Krumping"""" back to """"Krump"""". The only reason why I changed the way the words ended in the first place was to provide a link directly to their respective articles instead of to the redirects (not because I'm being subjective). But you change the links back so that they point to the redirects. It's not like your helping people in their understanding. All you did was link those dance styles back to redirect pages instead of to the actual articles. How petty is that. Take Bollywood for another example. Are you aware of the fact that Bollywood dance redirects to Hindi dance songs? Not to mention the fact that there's also a big huge original research banner at the top of that article. How is this article going to help someone understand Bollywood dance better than the Dance in India article which is where I linked it to before you reverted my edit. If you really didn't like it pointing to that article you could have at least linked it to Bollywood#Bollywood song and dance this time. Either way, at least people reading those pages would understand the dance better than reading an article about Hindi dance songs which has very few citations. Stop being selfish and think about the readers.

Final thoughts
By-the-way, regardless of how the show presents street dance, """"old school"""" is two words and breaking will always be hip-hop dance considering it is one of the pillars of hip-hop culture. That's a fact and not subjective. Read a book, watch a documentary, or educate yourself some other way if you don't want to hear me out. I'm going to change """"old school"""" back to two words because it's good grammar. I'm also going to remove electric boogie, take African out of the jazz dance group, and fix all the disambiguation links you added. Then I'll either make pas de duex it's own row again or put lyrical hip-hop back beside hip-hop. Or maybe do both. Or maybe not even touch them. I haven't decided yet since you have a problem my editing except for the last option. I don't know what you would settle with. Any other changes I make won't be without good reason. I think I've demonstrated that by my long-winded response to your comments. If it kills you to see me make these edits again then go ahead and revert them. At that point, I'll just go to WP:RFC and solicit the opinions of people who don't care about either of us or SYTYCD because I'm not about to argue back-and-forth on this talk page with you considering that you don't WP:OWN the page, you have no sources, and more importantly, you have no WP:CONSENSUS about a rule you made up which you yourself reneged on.

Fenris has been at Gamefaqs for nearly 4 years, whereas I have only stumbled across Gamefaqs in early 2005. I have seen Fenriswolf's posts in the Asia and Japan regional boards, and from the nature of them he seems to be a loyal, unquestioned admirer of the Chinese communist government. Myself however, is an Australian citizen. Although I do not oppose the Chinese government, I support eventual democracy in China, and can at least acknowledges its negative aspects. If I was indeed a mindless follower of the Chinese government, then why didn't I remove entire sections of articles such as Falun Gong and Epoch Times regarding negative aspects of the government? I reverts some of TJive's edits due to his choice of wording, such as his insistance in calling certain governments """"regimes"""", and his tendency to edit without discussion, dismissing me as a stooge of the Chinese government on his user page.. If you look at my edit history, I do not delibrately start any vandalism or edit wars, and has contributed lots to science-fiction and videogame related articles.

"RE: Deletion of 2004 Australian Election results 

Galloglass, I understand your concerns. However, the only example of the retention of previous electoral results was with the Bennelong example (which is a historically important seat; oweing to the fact that the previous minister was indeed Prime Minister Howard, who had held for the seat over 3 decades, and no other PM has lost his seat since Stanely Bruce) so I therefore felt it would be widely understood that the removal of the previous election results from the page would be acceptable. The 2004 Election results remain on many multiple pages because no-one has updated these pages, and this is what I am striving to do. 

If you feel that my actions are incorrect (which I can completely understand from your perspective), maybe you could create a new page (much like the one for Bennelong) and list the 2004 and earlier Election results here.

 Amuca tribeThe  

The """"Amuca tribe"""" in Turkish: """"Amuca Kabilesi""""

Amucalar, is one of the nomadic Oghuz Turks tribes, of the Ottoman Empire, which moved from Anatolia to the Balkans. At the end of 14th Century , this clan established a settled life in Ottoman Thrace.

We seem to have a few issues under discussion at the same time here, and I think it would be helpful to separate them.   

Maintaining """"old"""" FAs
As  said (00:14, 11 December 2008), this article was promoted to FA in 2006, when standards were less demanding, so work is needing to keep it close to current FA standard.

Unfortunately the """"committee"""" process advocated by  doesn't work if the """"committee"""" is slow to respond. In Oct 2006 I pointed out some serious scientific errors in Dinosaur, another """"old"""" FA; nothing happened so in Jan 2007 I gave notice of my intention to fix these points; a few days later, after nobody objected, I fixed them; and a few days later the corrections were reverted, so that the article again contained the errors I'd pointed out 3 months earlier.    

Quality of images
This one has the potential to run for a long time. I have no strong objections to the image per se, but I'm not sure the article needs a reconstruction of a juvenile T rex'.   

Selection of images
Wikipedia is not a picture gallery, and images need to be used selectively. IMO if we have have plenty of images, as we appear to for dinosaurs, we  should use those that illustrate the content rather than just providing eye-candy. In many cases diagrams should take priority over pure pictures.   

Size and placement of images
There has been recent disussion of this at Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style#Forcing Lead image (plus a more general Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style item that's now archived and I can't find it) and at Wikipedia talk:Accessibility#Image position. To sum up my own views:
Images that illustrate specific content should be alongside that content.
Layout of pages that use images has become more difficult as widescreen monitors have become more prevalent, as increasing the text width reduces the height of paragraphs, sections, etc.
I dislike left-floating images, as this makes the text less readable by changing the postion of the start of the next line, so that users have to search for it rather than jump to a familiar X co-ordinate.
The functions of images vary. Sometimes they convey a lot of detailed info, and a larger size than the default is needed. On other occasions they need give only a general impression of what something looks like, and a smaller size than the default is adequate. The majority of readers are unregistered and therefore cannot set preferences for image size or anything else. Hence editors have to pick image sizes that are appropriate for the purpose.
Accessibility to users with poor vision (but not functionally blind) is irrelevant, as they will either have their browsers set permanently on """"zoom in"""" or have software that zooms in for all apps.
 makes ugly gaps in the text and reduces the readability of articles.
IMO all these points indicate that MOS cannot dictate a """"one size fits all"""" solution and editors should be free to set image sizes.   """,0.0
"Good Article Review
Very good work on the article, a few things before it gets GA status:
Please set up character and setting sections like, for example, Final Fantasy V, this will allow uncrufty expansion on who Master Chief is and where the game takes place.
You could use more game manual citations in the gameplay section, several statements at least could use citations.

"She is not an undocumented worked, as she is not working.  It is unfair to punish me with my attempt to include a key fact (I have modified it is several different ways in an attempt to compromise, but to also make sure this critically important fact is included in the article).

I have fairly and accurately stated that she should be listed as an illegal immigrant/alien in the history as you initially asked. (others, you twice and Ramsey2006 has done three reverts.  Not only to undo my additions, but the person with address 68.whatever)

The fact that biased sources (i.e. people with links to groups involved in the story with an agenda can revert a known fact for political reason completely undermines wikipedia.)  Know, this is the first article I have attempted to edit, but this omission is considerable. 

Now, I am learning as I go, I put clear reasons in the history for my change, at your request, but you have punished me a second time, by reverting back.

Reasoning:

Somebody who crosses the border illegally is an illegal alien.

Elvira Arellano is therefore an illegal alien.

Elvira Arellano may also be an undocumented worker, but so a teenager who does not report baby sitting wages.

To list Elvira Arellano as solely and undocumented worker, with no reference to her being an illegal immigrant/alien is factually negligent.

Countless news articles refer to her as such:

 This page needs to be removed. 

There is no such place as """"Stafford"""" Virginia.  It is only Stafford County, Virgina (which is another Wikipedia page).  There is no locality in Stafford County with specific boundaries referred to as just """"Stafford"""".  The Census Bureau CDP location within Stafford County is called """"Stafford Courthouse"""" as this article correctly states.  The Stafford Courthouse area (at the center of Stafford County) is only 4.276 sq miles (per Census data).  There are certainly no high schools within this area nor are the historical places that are listed here.  When people say they live in Stafford (as I do all the time), they mean Stafford County.  They never mean the Stafford Courthouse area of Stafford County.  It is the same Fauquier, King George, Spotsylvania, Loudoun and many other counties in Virginia.  People often drop the word """"County"""" of their hometown, but it is not a separate place.  They are still the counties.  People use King George, VA or Stafford, VA on a postal letter.  These are simply short for writing King George County, VA or Stafford County, VA.

There is no section/district/locality of Stafford County referred to as """"Stafford"""".  The """"Municipalities and communities of Stafford County, Virginia, United States"""" box at the bottom of this page incorrectly lists the CDP as """"Stafford"""" when it is actually """"Stafford Courthouse"""" in all census data.

Nothing on this page is correct other that the statement that there is a CDP location called Stafford Courthouse CDP and population of the Stafford Courthouse CDP location within that 4.276 sq mile area.  (Stafford County is approximately 267 thousand square miles, with a population of approximately 129 thousand people).

Croatian Women's Cup finals
I stumbles upon a Croatian newspaper archive. http://library.foi.hr/nv/default.aspx?G=1&u;= Those newspapers cover football at like 3 pages per day. I wondered if one is able to find results or at least runner-ups from 1992 to 2001. As i don't speak Croatian and don't know the dates of the finals, i can't come up with good searchterm to create few good results. Maybe you could have a short try at that site? Something like women's cup final, women's football, year final, or cupwinner + final or something. Thanks in advance. -

Info is taken from annual yearbooks (Almanah YU fudbala) published after each season. I'll add it a as a non-linked source.99.255.217.164  

 Article importance assessment drive... 

Whoa! I was this close to raising an issue with the WP 1.0 bot, because it looked like it was almost 100 articles off, and noone is assessing that many articles a day... -)   
All in a day's work ;-) Mind you, 99% of everything I assessed received a low importance rating. It would sure be easier to keep them in check if WP:CRO templates were marked """"low importance"""" (and """"stub"""") by default, requiring manual input only for quality/importance upgrades. Speaking of which, if one wanted to adapt WP:Germany's version of the table depicting importance scale, where would one paste it at WP:CRO project's page? Should I just put it on talk page until we find a better place for it?   ([[User talk:Timbouctou|talk]]) 
From time to time I assess a couple of articles, and usually it's """"low"""" because these are easy to pick: villages, barely notable films and such. Yeah, it's a chore, but in this case occasional (or semi-permanent, to be honest) backlogs don't really hurt either...
Well, the only proper place for the table is surely Wikipedia:WikiProject Croatia/Assessment, i.e. the assessment subpage (currently used for something slightly different, but this is easily fixable). Maybe the time to introduce it has come... I'm not sure myself, the project might offer an answer.   
Just noticed you tried to add the quality scale... I've wrapped it in , which prevents it from messing up the main page. Not really a solution - ideally the assessment page and what is displayed in the Assessment frame should be entirely different things - but it works, kind of.   

 Re: Maps in infobox settlement 

There's an intermediate template that you'd have to create, or use a parameter of the existing Template:Location map Croatia. If the coordinates match, the latter could work. But, I don't know offhand if and how this extra parameter fits into Template:Infobox settlement parameters.   

 Henlein 

I found out that while with Građanski Zagreb, the Austrian Karl Henlein was actually a coach/player. He is former Austrian international. Here (3rd paragraph) is says that Gradjanski had 2 Austrian internationals, refering to Henlein and probably Rupec. That makes me doubt if Jaroslav Šifer (Schiffer) ever got to play with Austria, as he played in this same period as well in the club, thus, if Sifer was Austrian international, they would have been 3, and not 2, as mentioned. All sources say that J. Šifer was only Yugoslav international, but the only source claimng he played for Austria, that I know, is RSSSF. Any ideas?   

 HČSP 

Well, I'm sorry that I reverted all of the info, but some of it was either unsourced or non-neutral. I edited the page again, so let me know what do you think.

That was the idea when they made them, AC = boarders and TC = day kids. So in my view they are apart of each other? 

Maybe it is just the way I am looking at the topic at hand? im too 'personalised' with it?

Ok, So is it just my view of the topic OR am i completely screwed up on this entire thing.

This is an oooold subject/section here, but I agree, the highly detailed diagram is quite scary-looking to a novice reader, and much more complicated than the basics of the topic. Start with something simpler, since there are certainly simpler aspects of diffraction than multislit-with-vectors. File:Wave Diffraction 4Lambda Slit.png would certainly be an improvement (simpler case, still a pretty picture that clearly illustrates some key ideas). I think that diagram would be even better if the barrier/slit were actually visible clearly rather than just another thin black line in a parallel field of black lines: consider either File:Difraction.png or File:Difrakce sterbina bodova.png. Somewhat related, seems like there is no navbox for the wave-phenomena articles. Having a directory of the reflection, refraction, diffraction, interferences, etc. main articles would be a great way to tie together all these pages and help students work through/among them.   20:14",0.0

Hi Pigsonthewing,

As someone who has been silently observing your behaviour over the past few months on Wikipedia, I am worried by what I perceive to be a downward spiral of petty fighting, vindictiveness, childishness and bad faith on your part. It seems that you've lost the joy in editing Wikipedia, and now you do as some sort of way of making yourself feel better at the expense of others. What a small, small man you are. Grow up! Get a life! Find yourself a girl to have sex with or something, because the way you've been sliding downhill is bringing everyone else at this fine institution down. I'm here to create an encyclopedia. You seem to be here to fight with other people and cause disruptions. You're making everyone else's life harder. Please stop that; just go away.

 Re: Justification for comment left which took the piss out of everything to do with your faith it seems

Well, that was longer than I anticipated for a title. Oh well. Anyway, do you think I am an arrogant, 'shithead' by reading that? or just a tad 'rant'headed?

Sorry, but your comment was abusive to me aswell, mate. 'I think you should tell him how to treat people'. Okay, I might of took the piss out of some person and I don't know if I did the 'christian' """"faith"""" aswell, I can't remeber to be honest.

But anyway, Justification...I am nice anyhow, but do get pissed. When I get pissed off with people, I get nasty. I was reading Aristophanes earlier that day (thats why it was in a poem). And all my poems have Underlying critical elements or 'praise' in them. You got the 'abusive tone' of the poem, but probably not the underlying bit. Or by the reaction of the first, you be deeply off the scale. I wonder what I said what made the 'christians' came into factor...I really can't remeber. Dam should've saved it. 

About the 'tell him that capps are for shotuing on the internet', I know that all ready. I used it for something called 'emphasis, may of heard it. Also, I was FUCKING PISSED AT THE TIME SO YOU DO FUCKING SHOUT AND SWEAR. don't you? yep...if you don't, your not human...well the swearing part you can reframe from. But your a man, so swearing is allowed. Only women where you say 'sorry for my french' (again justification, I am english that is a phrase over here > i am not just digging at the french)

So, yeah...I was on a rant for a bit...won't happen again. Unless a person is abusive to me. THEN HE WILL DIE. well not die...just lightly peotically abused...THEN HE WILL DIE...no stop with the killing? see I am mad sometimes...I am actually a comedian...so I don't take anything seriously. maybe I should...bombs away dude.

Recently the Wikipedia Arbitration Committee has declared that significant global warming is an indisputable fact, and has begun banning people from editing this, and other articles, if they insert sources which question the magnitude or severity of anthropogenic climate change.  This is in direct violation of the Wikipedia's own NPOV policy, which requires Wikipedia articles to not endorse specific viewpoints as true, and which requires that all significant perspectives be included in an article.  However, emotions are high on the issue of global warming, and the Wikipedia Arbitration Committee has decided that it is more important for the climate change articles at Wikipedia to reflect their views on climate change, than it is for the climate change articles to be neutral and impartial in their presentation and content.

And if, as this article says, a Túath had about 10,000 people that would mean about 1 million on the whole island, which sounds about right from what I've heard of population estimates of the time.

hey warrens, fuck you too. """"Uncivil manner, means me trying to elaborate on my arguments and getting  revert on revert that's what uncivil means. So yeah your a big winner champ and won't get banned. Asshole. 

Since the vista article contains information about the anti trust situation which, since it seems some people here have got a mouthful of gate's balls, is mislabelled anti trust controversy. Not really a controversy though is it when a court elected by over two hundred million people issues a decision, it'a court ruling, like it or not there's no controversy too that. Otherwise we should renaim the ted bundy trial, to the tend bundy controversy, since any court ruling merits this label. 

Since there's a section on anti trust laws and vista, it's worth noting the recent news that microsoft are going to be paying a hefty daily fine for completely ignoring the court's injuction. And this does have bearing on vista. You can't quote the m.s. pr saying we don't know what they want us to do, it's all questions, or whatever else he mentioned, without an adjunct sentence, of the head official regulating the anti trust actions quoting him too saying that our injuctions are crystal clear yet ms has ignored them for over two years now. 

But of course this has no bearing if this article is supposed to be a showcase for vista.

So like i said, if some fuckers had gone into the trouble of actually discussing any of that instead of reverted every single edit in a hitleric fashion, things would be different.

But for now this stategy of being a hawk on an article I wish to keep in a certain way, and being completely uncivil and rude about it, merits from my part a roayl, fuck y's all, take your mouths off of gate's balls and then we can talk.

Here on Wikipedia, my daughter was treated with insolence, which is unacceptable: . That was after one month from when they joined Wikipedia. They jumped into mediation only two days after joining, but the intentions are very evident:

The reason I switched accounts is clearly known, to help protect my daughter from harassment on Wikipedia and still try to contribute: . 

She has persisted ever since to cover it up:  (and the recent event on AN/I, and ArbCom) (I actually had to look up what forum shopping meant.)

After enough times the same old stuff was brought up over and over, with many admins giving decisions, but those decisions weren't good enough for her, until finally I was blocked.

For the record, my edits were deemed reasonable, but: 

I'm very hurt my daughter was brought up here. There is also another reason why I left my old account, and that is because I wanted to leave the talk page with the discussion that made it very evident. Maybe her sockpupet friend really felt bad and left Wikipedia not because of me, but because he didn't feel right about this: 

I love my daughter, but I'm crying right now because I know one day she will search Wikipedia and see what was said. I have no doubt that Durova does not regret what she did, hence where she said """"sad"""": 

I didn't come back to Wikipedia to disrupt anybody. If you notice below, my references show the connection between open source (an article I've slowly edited over time) and astrotheology. Check my user contributions, and you can verify those are the main two and the last month.

 Ownership of articles 

Hi, this is Marxus, sorry, I don't know how to use those phrases and didn't know how to use them at all. I will try to now since you have told me. You see, I wrote many articles on Richard Brautigan novels such as A Confederate General From Big Sur, The Hawkline Monster: A Gothic Western, Willard and His Bowling Trophies: A Perverse Mystery, Sombrero Fallout: A Japanese Novel, Dreaming of Babylon: A Private Eye Novel 1942, and An Unfortunate Woman: A Journey. For the novels The Hawkline Monster, Willard and His Bowling Trophies, Sombrero Fallout, and Dreaming of Babylon, I don't like when someone else changes what I have written. They create that thing on the right hand side of the novel pages about more information, I don't like that. Especially since there is no pictures on top it makes the article look bad. And I am sorry about the vandalism but I just want people changing my articles and when I change it back it goes back to the one I didn't like. I thank you for your information but please can you make that stop though and I am not trying to be rude or anything I am just asking my articles to be the way I would like them is all. Thank you and please respond.

Please note that you do not own any article; no article on Wikipedia is your article, even if you created it and are the only person who has edited it. So let me strongly suggest that you step back and think before using the phrase """"my article"""" again. Trying to justify your vandalism on the basis that someone does something that you don't like is about the weakest excuse possible.

Fair use rationale for Image:TranquilityPark.jpg

Thanks for uploading or contributing to Image:TranquilityPark.jpg. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Suggestions on how to do so can be found  here.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page. 

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the """"my contributions"""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"Image"""" from the dropdown box.

There was only one Alfred de Grazia, and he was the one under attack by the Holocaust denier and apologist, so I wrote this to him:
Re: https://furtherglory.wordpress.com/2015/08/09/in-world-war-ii-were-there-2-americans-named-alfred-degrazia/#comment-46215
The Alfred de Grazia that was purported to have done all the things attributed to him by you is the same as my father; however, I cannot say why he said any or all of these things, or what the Army actually used him for, or if and why he posted the picture as him when it wasn’t and isn’t. I replaced in the place I found it the actual picture of him posing in front of the stacked bodies at what I am sure was Buchenwald, and Anne-Marie von Hueber – de Grazia said that he had also been to Auschwitz. I did not know this until she made the statement on Facebook in connection with the photo. My father tended to self-aggrandizement and liked Jews who he thought were very smart. He also tended to be a Sophist, or sophistical. He could have written a lot with intent, or purposively. But still, why are you choosing this man, who did so much for humanity, as any sort of model for any sort of behavior that you might find unfavorable to your interests? The Nazis made their own bed and dragged the German people into it. The bombing of cities had already begun in WWI with German Zeppelins hitting London. The British chose to be the first to bomb German cities in WWII, but it would have started with German bombers in due time. I wandered the battlefields of Europe for years, just feeling the pain and division; even in my own mind and family, and grew up with young men and women who had lost their parents in the War, years before. Find someone else to pillory. Al de Grazia should be left in peace; he did his duty and it was rough from the start. He accomplished miracles considering all. Wikipedia is not good for you or your cause; it is filled with crap that anyone with a brain can see is made up to suit the authors’ purposes. I believe the term is “whole cloth;” right from the weaving mill and ready to be cut to suit the maker’s needs.

 About Corticopia 

Corticopia's past 

Hello:

I just want to share with you some information you might consider important. We had a very difficult time months ago removing Mexico from Central America in the article North America. Why? Because an """"anonimous"""" user (IP from Toronto Canada) was reverting all the changes. I finally discovered he was an already registered user and got him blocked because of sockpuppetry. One month later, I found out he was already been accused of sockpuppetry with that account.

Well my point is that he is against of Mexico being included in North America. His main """"argument"""" was that the UN geosheme includes Mexico in CA and that's it. He also denies that North America is also a subregion of America and ignores the cited content proving him wrong. Well, he is Corticopia. For months he was retired and trust me, NO BODY changed the articles North America and Central America (specially this one) to say Mexico was in CA.

Suddenly a """"new"""" user shows up. He deleted a line in the article CA. It said """"Mexico is rarely, yet sometimes included in Central America under certain definitions"""". This line was discussed and agreed. He changed it to """"Mexico is included in Central America"""" then to """"Mexico is sometimes included in Central America"""".

I don't know what his problem is. The important thing is I totally felt this is the same person we had a very serious vandalism problems months ago, so I checked his edit list. Wow! What a discovery, his first edit was the article Issac Asimov and articles about Canada and some other regions of the world. It was very obvious it was the same person. Please check this sources  and this . Please, read them carefully.

Please check the contributions of each accused sockpuppetry account, specially the one of User:Ex post factoid. It is very obvious he is the same person.

He was dragged into the article Mexico when he was unable to """"win"""" again in the article Central America (he didn't even try to change the article North America because he knows a lot of people guard that article). So his reason to say Mexico is in """"Southern North America"""" are purely false and personal. He wants to """"exclude"""" Mexico or make it """"look"""" appart from Canda and the USA.

I'm telling you this because I think you don't realize his reasons are just personal, a personal aversion against Mexico being included in North America. If he's so interested in accuracy of the articles, why isn't he editing the article USA? He even asked Supaman to do it by himself. He's just there to exclude Mexico. Please read carefully the evidence provided in each sockpuppetry case. You said that you're an administrator in Spanish Wikipedia, so I think you're experienced in these cases. You will find it is the same person. Cortiopia has edited the same pattern of articles that the other accounts did. Too bad I warned him and I'm sure he stopped editing with that account to prevent being identified. I think we should stop him and prevent him from editing the article with his biased, excluding information, even if sourced, because his reasons are just personal and not for the sake of accuracy.

 NPOV
I do not discuss the credibility of Solovyov. The problem is that the whole artticle is written in aggressively anti-Russian tone. The article does not use new works on the problem. So, yopu need to clean away these unproven and chauvinistic sentences:
 even overt instigation of a civil war 
 Under the new treaty Ukraine was to become an equal constituent nation of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth along with Poland and Lithuania under a name of Principality of Rus, forming the Polish-Lithuanian-Ruthenian Commonwealth. Brutal lies, because the treaty did not mention any ukraine.
 The latter were mercilessly exterminated along with wide-spread abuse and robbery of the civilian population Please leave this tone for nationalistic yellow pnewspapers.
 On April 21, 1659, after a morning prayer, Trubetskoy ordered an all-out assault on the fortress's fortifications. The city was shelled, a few incendiary bombs were dropped inside, and the huge army moved on to capture the city. At one point the troops of Trubetskoy even broke inside the city walls, but were thrown back by the fierce resistance of the Cossacks inside. After the fiasco of the initial assault, Trubetskoy abandoned his plans of a quick assault and proceeded to shell the city and to fill the moat with earth. The Cossacks stubbornly held on in spite of all the fire unleashed on the city: during the night the earth put to fill in the moat was used to strengthen the city walls, and the besieged even undertook several daring counterattacks on Trubetskoy's besieging army. These attacks forced Prince Trubetskoy to move his military camp 10 km away from the city and thereby split his forces between the main army at his HQ and the army besieging Konotop. It is estimated that in the siege alone the Trubetskoy forces suffered casualties up to 10,000 men.[4] Instead of a quick campaign the siege dragged on for 70 days and gave Vyhovsky the much-needed time to prepare for the battle with the Russian army. Please clean away this exaggerated and long tale about nothing. You must add information, that Trubetskoy negotiated with Gulyanitski and finally had to put siege. Gulyanitski just wanted to win time. You must give time schedule, dates of the events and clean away this heroisation of some coronel.
  Vyhovsky and his allies approached the area and defeated a small reconnaissance detachment of the invader's army near the village of Shapovalivka Why invaders? The Ukraine was part of Russia.
 The bloom of Moscow's cavalry, troops that happily accomplished campaigns of year 54 and 55 have perished in one day — the victors got only about 5000 captive. The unfortunate were led onto an open space and slaughtered like lambs — that was the agreement between the Crimean Khan and the hetman of the Zaporozhian Cossacks! Never again was the tsar of Moscow able to master an army that strong. In mourning clothes showed himself Alexei Mikhailovich to the people and the terror seized Moscow. The blow was so hard because it was unexpected, and it followed such illustrious successes! It was only recently that Dolgoruki brought to Moscow a captured Lithuanian hetman, only recently was everyone talking about successes of Khovansky — and now Trubetskoy, for whom everyone had hopes higher than for others, and who was """"a man devout and graceful, in military affairs skilled and a fright for a foe"""" — has ruined such a huge army! After capture of so many towns, after capture of the Lithuanian capital the royal city trembled for its own security: in August by tsar's decree people of all ranks hurried to build fortifications around Moscow. Often the tsar and the boyars were present themselves during the construction; people from outlying areas, their families with meagre belongings filled Moscow, and a rumour spread that the tsar was leaving to beyond the Volga and Yaroslavl[1]. Clean away this quote or I will give other long quotes from other books concerning the battle. This is not a wikiquote. This citation is not appropriate.
 Then you must sit and read what modern authors write about the battle, different views about how it hppened. The only source is the Witness, and he did not gave many lies you put into the article.  """,0.0

"Dolls & robots 
As the article stands right now, the lede has absolutely no mention of dolls or robots.  The entire article doesn't contain a single mention of the word 'robot'.  I have made persistent efforts (most recent) toward rectifying this, but each time my edits have been reverted.  Rationale for the removal included the view that I was adding original research and that my additions were not WP:LEDE compliant in that there was no mention of robots within the body of the article.  For editors who strive to increase the quality of Wikipedia, it is clear to me that the most helpful action to take for these valid criticisms, instead of simply hitting the 'revert' button, is this:

- Statement in lede is unsupported.
Fix:  Flag as needing a reference.  (I found a great book with a single googling.)

- Lede is discussing a topic that is not discussed in the article's body.
Fix:  Add a statement or two into the body.

I realize that these approaches to fixes require putting in a little more effort, but that's the direction that leads to higher quality articles instead of preserving the gaping holes in them.

Last point:  If there's an edit instability regarding the quality of an article, it is clear to me that the best place to initiate a Talk discussion is on the article's Talk page and not any particular User's Talk page (ie: mine).  This way other editors who care about the issue in question are not required to go hunting around in order to get up to speed on whatever disagreements had transpired.  Now if the issue is that a particular user is vandalizing an article, then that would be an excellent reason to open a discussion on the UserTalk page and keep the article Talk insulated from irrelevant noise.",0.0

 If the names are different from mythos, citation need. Nope, similar name isn't enough. You may think it's obvious, but there is chance that the name actually derived from something else or the author simply want weird name. In fact, many of deities in Aztec mythology has name as weird as Cthulhu.

Well, Alan, the article may be more about a type of smoking than a type of smoking reduction but the benefit of one-hitters to the latter issue remains important.
You have reduced the number of pictures to 3 this seems to me unbalanced in that Smoking pipe (tobacco) is allowed to run on for over 23,000 bytes (all drawn from only 3 notes, 3 references, 5 external links) with 11 pictures compared to One-hitter (smoking) with under 4000 bytes and 3 pictures.  Factbase: I should google this first, but I think I saw an article stating that only 1% of the tobacco smokers worldwide use a pipe (compared with 5% cigar and 94% cigarettes); if 1/10 as many persons used cannabis as tobacco and 10% of cannabis users used a one-hitter, on that basis alone besides there being ethnic one-hitters used for tobacco too the articles should have equal length.
I think the value of the article depends partly on some information (particularly history) which is conveniently presented in picture captions; so how about I look into using the """"gallery"""" approach which posts the pictures at the bottom of the article, smaller than the regular thumbnail kind but enlargeable.

 IPA - what 

I read the main page of the article on IPA.
On the plus side it is clear.
On the minus side, it makes no attempt to explain what the IPA is.  (context, scope, purpose, etc.)
Nice chart.  Lots of data (for people who probably have no need of it) but virtually no general information.
My questions (which weren't answered - keep in mind I'm a totally lay person):
An alphabet is used to 1.  Communicate between a writer and a reader (of the same language), 2.  Describe that communication (unambigously?)  Right?

Certain things are implied by its name, but clearly one should define what the subject of the alphabet is (are).  I have no idea if it covers all indoeuropean languages not to mention Mandarin Chinese (etc.)?
Does it (attempt) to cover all spoken languages? Written?  What about non-vocal languages (finger snaps - all that stuff).  Sign-language?  We now have some evidence that hand gestures are linked to language in the brain...but I digress.  From a simplistic point of view language can be thought of as being three distinct (context sensitive) types of communication: written/read, spoken/heard and performed/viewed.  I suppose an alphabet can't cover the last (but see how choreographers describe dance) and, obviously, there are non-alphabetical languages (pictographics, heiroglyphic, etc.) just as there are languages which make use of whistles, clicks.  SO what does the IPA do?

It just occured to me that maybe the IPA is (now-a-days) only used by euro-centric hobbyists and that would explain why there was no attention given to giving a serious explanation of what it is: """"if you have to ask...{then you don't need to know}""""""",0.0

 blockade of Cadiz 

Dear sir. Thank you for asking me first. 
Naval blockades are just """"blockades"""" and cannot be described as """"battles"""", because they're not. This article refers to the assault on the city by Nelson's amphibious forces. After having failed to bombard the town, Nelson was dispatched on the even more disatrous Santa Cruz expedition, later in the month. The blockade effectively went on, but St. Vincent withdrew the main fleet to the Tagus in the atumn, keeping a squadron of observation cruising off Cadiz during the winter...

The name """"Assault on Cadiz"""" instead """"Blockade of Cadiz"""" gives this engagement a more accurate and specific name, because a maritime blockade is not a sea battle. Another article could be """"the blockade of cadiz!"""", where you could write every feat of arms that occurred from 1797 until 1798-1802, but as the blockade of cadiz is not a """"campaign"""", it has no sense to even think about it.

Purrum, look in the mirror mate because you're full of self-righteous opinions, views, hypotheticals, allegations, accusations, hearsay and fabricated information on Ronald Ryan. And, you have the ordacity to express them on Wikipedia! 
Tell us Purrum, why don't you also request deletion of every published """"hateful"""" opinions by Hodson, that have appeared in various media articles over the decades, for everybody to read? Common sense suggests that if Hodson demands her opinions on Ryan be published on the media, then it becomes relevant referenced material for Wikipedia. If Hodson doesn't want her opinions to be made public information, then she should keep her vile mouth shut. Therefore, I will continue to add every referenced article regarding Ryan on Wikipedia, for the purposes of fully informing and educating the public.
It's obvious that Purrum passes judgement on what referenced articles should be banned, deleted, sensored and replaced with lies - nothing but lies!

Hi. I have recently come under some personal attacks by admins of Wikipedia sparked by my edits on the Kastellorizo article.

I would like you to initiate a prtoection for the page of Stavros Damianides. He was a well known Bouzouki player in Australia and in his younger days played with the best artists in Greece.

The other matter is that despite evidence being given of well respected sources, these particular admins have repeatedly attacked and vandalized his entry.

I gave the quickest examples I could find. I can find numerous other references to the poppier nature of Van Halen on all three sources. And while I agree a source is not often 100% reliable, especially one relying on opinion...3 major sources IS. Especially given they're frequently used accross Wikipedia. Van Halen began as a hard rock band with a heavy metal edge at times...but """"Dreams"""" is definitely a pop rock song. Generally the 1984 album is considered the one where the band became poppier, and in the Sammy Hagar era that really took root. 

Power ballads are the most common pop rock crossover out there.

Oh, and a lot of their covers were poppy songs anyway, like You Really Got Me.

I have some more stuff below, but first, look at this. I doubt you can be bothered to listen to them all, but listen to the first 30 seconds of each:

As a side note, Bon Jovi's first two albums are definitely glam metal - they made their name as part of the glam metal scene. Which is pop metal by the way, making it hard to classify. They went the commercial side of things and moved away from metal. Guns N' Roses, again, sleaze rock. Something that formed from the ashes of glam metal - but Guns N' Roses were among the first. So the line between sleaze and metal blurs with them. They ARE the crossover point. AC/DC I'd not call metal, and I think KISS had a few metal songs but don't really count...but they are heavily disputed the two of them. Opinions on either carry little weight. 

Wikipedia has several definitions for pop rock: """"Pop rock is a subgenre of rock music that uses """"catchy"""" pop style, with light lyrics over top of """"guitar-based"""" songs"""". I would say that sums up some of Van Halen's stuff to a t. """"they only use pop hooks or synths to appeal to both a hard rock and pop audience from time to time""""? Have you heard their latter-day singles? 

""""Sure they used synth, and sure they've used pop hooks, but haven't countless other hard rock and heavy metal bands done so?""""

It most frequently happened in glam metal. Which is aka pop metal. Glam metal is a genre a lot of people wanted to attach to Van Halen, personally I think just because something's pop rock and heavy metal at different times does not make it pop metal. Hence my desire to keep pop rock - the comparisons to glam metal are made obvious that way. It's hard to ignore them, but also impossible to just call it glam metal.""",0.0

Yet, I do believe that, like other articles on wikipedia, it should be free from any bias. I will doubtless reword anything that is defamatory (statements such as """"far-right"""", """"largely ignored"""" etc will be instantly deleted, since these are sheer personal opinions.), as per Wikipedia's policy.

 Genres 

 I can see this is becoming an issue on a number of other pages.  It's not enough simply to have a source when adding genres to an infobox:
 The """"genre"""" field should be limited to genres that describe the album (or group, or whatever) in general, and not every genre that has been incorprated into it.  Imagine what the Beatles' infobox would look like otherwise.
 The sources you are citing are not necessarily supporting the genres you're adding: for instance, Earles says: """"Side B is ... proto-Sabbath sludge metal or proto-noise rock, depending on how you wish to retroactively consider this stuff against the underground rock history that came before and has transpired since ... etc etc doom metal scene etc etc power- and thrash-metal movements ..."""" ... it takes quite an imagination to read that and conclude that My War is a """"sludge metal album"""".
 """"Genre"""" is the kind of thing Wikipedians often come close to slitting each others' jugulars over (see WP:GENREWARRIOR).  If you want to stay on good terms with your fellow editors, you'd best discuss changes to the """"genre"""" field on the talk page.

 Would you take on a project?? 

There are two users, currently both with a week-long block for edit warring over an article Che Guevara (photo), although the blocking admin is vacillating, suggesting an RFC which I know is useless. One of the editors, User:Redthoreau, I tangled with a while ago and ultimately ended up nominating the article in question for FAR, Wikipedia:Featured article review/Che Guevara/archive1. The other editor User:Damiens.rf I don't know, but his current complain is that 61 quotations in an article is too many. 

The blocking admin User talk:EdJohnston wants to handle the situation constructively but does not know how. I suggested to him that someone like you, an experienced editor might be willing to be a neutral editor between the two, focused on article quality.

I suggested you (and perhaps also User talk:Geometry guy) to direct the warring editors to concentrate on article quality. My experience in the past with User:Redthoreau is that he does rather well when a """"father figure"""" type takes an interest. Some of his obnoxiousness, I believe, is due to youthful aggression and ignorance. I think he would respond positively to someone whose goal was to produce a quality article. As he dominates all things Guevara, the only way to improve the Guevara articles on Wikipedia is to move  Redthoreau over onto the side of the forces of good.

Since the focus would just be this one article, and your job would be to render advice/judgement on article criteria, I think the job would not be unduly burdensome. Redthoreau had a past mentor-like relationship with User:Coppertwig and did very well when pointed in the right direction behaviourally. (Of course, you may not be quite the right model there!)

Would you consider taking on this project? It might be just up your alley. I figure that since Redthoreau is not going to go away, he may as well put all that energy into writing articles that don't have 61 quotations in them. How about it?  — (Talk) """,0.0

 My first hand dissapointing experience with the movement == == 

I have been to several Larouche meetings and I find it very interesting that the Larouche Movement advocates that we non-members are conditioned by fear (especially baby boomers) not to join their fight when on the contrary they use nothing but catastrophic speculations as recruitment. Larouche has been propagating perpetual nuclear warfare and the collapse of the economy for decades. I have personally been told that I would work at Starbucks after my degree (I have a well paying successful job today), the economy will collapse within a year (this was told to me a few years ago), and I was shown pictures of soldiers being hanged referring personally to my faith if I had not joined their fight to stop it. 

You see, by joining this movement, members take a leap over all their earthly problems by being placed in purposeful positions to save the world and receive immortality of the soul in return. Which depressed kid would not want to be placed into that fantasy world. The lonely recruits receive brotherhood; the ones who have failed in life are given intellectual reverence surmounting any non-larouchie, that’s a good opiate receptor! Many of these recruits come into the movement as empty slates to be filled up with Larouche tactics, this is why the Larouche YOUTH Movement has been the biggest sector in their existence. This is also a reason Larouche recruiters blatantly challenge their contacts not to listen to their parents, professors, or any adults with the explanation that they have become forever impudent by fear through degenerate cultures that us kids still have a chance to overcome. 

1) They believe in aristocracy, as their beloved and foundation, Plato does. It's interesting how their cause is to invest in the potential of every single human mind when their political system would be setup to discount and make decisions for the non-aristocrats, which would be us weaklings. And before one of you fresh Larouchie's claims this is not true, it had been recorded in a briefing. 

2) They want you to drop out of school because classes are setup as a 1-way channel between teacher and students, rather than, a pedagogue where everyone can facilitate the exchange of diverse ideas. I find this most interesting when i was accused of being a British operative in my attempt to exchange the ideas of philosophers and economic theories they were never exposed to. During a meeting my questions were brushed off and not answered, the speaker called them ‘academic’. The Larouche Movement is so organized that he has already conditioned his youth to negate any wake-up theories or opposing ones to be that of British conspiracy against mankind. In conclusion, this is no place to exchange ideas as they preach it is, it’s exchanging Larouche ideas or nothing. 

3) Larouche writes thousands of pessimistic speculations, and when one inevitably hits, he is plumed to be always right as the others are forgotten. The speculations that are forgotten are thrown under the umbrella of economic collapse and perpetual warfare with only the future to hold the truth. Just read Larouche writings, he tells you that he is the ONLY ONE in the WORLD who can save us from these disasters. His intent and cause seem great, but what does his character tell you about the underpinnings; his Will to Impose himself on others? It is so blatant that even the purblind can see the egotistical style in his writings, remember, this is called the LAROUCHE Movement. 

4) Larouche recruiters insult your way of living opposed to the thinkers, the ones who spend their time developing their minds in the movement. If the Larouchie’s are our saviors, if they are the brains of our renaissance, or even the brains of the world, studying Larouche mathematics, science, literature, philosophy, politics. Well how come none of the members ever made an invention or real impact. They really can use some invention to boost their popularity and finances. The reason this has not occurred is a great irony; these members are not self thinkers, they are followers, they study only Larouche and even with that knowledge they are too conditioned for Larouche to make new inferences.  

All this studying and organizing only embeds the shackles on their minds. It is very unfortunate, because these members truly become psychologically stuck in the movement. It is very hard for one to admit to the Self that all these years were a waist of time and they must now step back to the miserable status of earthly life they left off at. This, accompanied with the fact that these members breathe Larouche 24/7, is why they will and are stuck beyond all fathomable realizations of the world.",0.0

 WTF?! want != need 

Obviously, the idiot that wrote """"the need for instant gratification"""" failed economics 101. A need is something you must have for survival; that isn't instant gratification. A want is something that you would like to have but can live without.

The guy that edited this is probably a consumerist moron with thousands in credit card debt. Debtors are fools that shouldn't be allowed to own anything. This is why a fully market economy can't end poverty. Only those with a proper education should be allowed to participate in a market economy. Fools that don't know the difference between a want and a need should be owned by their employer. Their employer can better determine what they need than themselves. Poverty would be eliminated by this mix of a command and market economies. The remaining unemployed, fat, and lazy fools can go to jail.

"""== Blood fetish ==
Regarding blood fetish: please don't suggest to people that:
 - a common way of finding out whether a person would be safe to engage in bloodplay with is for them to go to their local blood donation organisation, who check blood if it is safe and contains no diseases before it will be stored.
Using a blood donation organization as a proxy STD test is highly irresponsible; if the testing is not 100% perfect (and in never is), and the person trying this is positive (and presumably anyone who is considering doing this considers this to be entirely possible), they will almost certainly (because of pre-test blood pooling, and the very large blood volumes involved) infect one or more unwitting third parties with a potentially lethal disease.

Instead, they should get tested at their local sexual health clinic.    

People just wanting to make sure are no more likely to have an STD than other first-time blood donors.. I don't see your point: If that kind of carelessness goes on things would happen *anyway*  (Α⇔Ω ¦ ⇒✉) 

It's reasonable to assume that people who take part in high-risk activities are at higher risk than other members of the population. In epidemiology terms, it's assortative mixing among people with high risk tolerance; people who take part in one high-risk activity are more likely to take part in others, including taking part in these activities with multiple partners; and no, you can't trust your partner who tells you """"I've never done anything like this before, either"""". Consider the outbreaks of HIV in the regularly-tested adult movie industry; this in a population that take part in high-risk activities, and yet are all tested monthly.   

Hmm I guess that makes sense, kinda

I would be interested in reading if you feel like creating articles for """"assortative mixing"""" and """"risk tolerance"""" maybe  or   (Α⇔Ω ¦ ⇒✉)

I'm not familiar with the article or the subject of its concern, but I fail to see how saying """"X does Y"""" constitutes an actual endorsement of Y.  If such a method is indeed commonplace then, regardless of the advisability of such method for practitioners of said activity, it should be included as part of the article on that activity.   

Karada, I think you miss the point here.  Just because certain behavior is inadvisable does not mean Wikipedia should not state that people engage in it (if indeed they do) and describe it.  Certainly, the encyclopedia should not ENDORSE it (but then again, neither should it endorse anything elseNPOV and all that), but simply stating that it happens and describing what it is hardly constitutes an endorsement.  If we were to remove all content that describes inadvisable behavior, then we would also have to remove Collectivism, Fascism, Socialism, Christianity, Communism, Totalitarianism, Anarchism, Democracy, New England Patriots, Detroit Pistons, and Houston Astros.   

It's also worth noting that there are some bloodborne diseases that we can't yet test for.  (Prion diseases like Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease comes to mind.)  In addition to spreading these diseases to one's blood play partners, one would then potentially infect one or more innocent bystanders each time one donated blood.  Most jurisdictions also bar donations from individuals who have recently (in the last 12 months) come in contact with another person's blood.  Lying to the nurses when they ask about this stuff could conceivably make you civilly and/or criminally liable for any morbidity or mortality resulting from a tainted blood donation. (talk)

"List of Mad Magazine issues 

Hi . Thanks for your recent improvement to this article. Collectonian's point is surely that keeping a list article with the combined tables of contents of all the issues is an honor that we accord to very few magazines. I personally believe that it's justified in the case of Mad, because famous publications deserve more coverage than obscure ones. Irrespective of Collectonian's particular viewpoint, a high-quality list article with lots of references is easier to defend against future requests for its deletion. I haven't studied this one enough to know how it could be improved, but I think your new intro is a step in the right direction. I hope to post again on the Talk but haven't had the time yet. 

You are one the of the people who I was hoping to get the attention of, because I think only someone familiar with the magazine would have good ideas for how to improve this article.  I read the magazine when I was a kid, but have no idea of how to explain its cultural significance. 

I notice that Mad (magazine) is also tagged for needing inline citations, and I sympathize with that tag. We need to get the help of some Mad aficionados who are willing to dig up references.",0.0

Well, I was thinking in terms of those who believe in the avatarship of Hariakhan Baba and his being the same as Lahiri Mahsaya's guru. He was already teaching long before Yogananda was even born, in fact even before Lahiri Mahasaya started his ministry. There are accounts of Panchanon Bhattacarya as well as Tincouri and Ducouri Lahiri handing prayaschitta money directly to Babaji, and also a personal visit of Babaji to the house of Lahiri Mahasaya witnessed by Pranavananda. So it is somewhat safe to conclude that Mahavatar Babaji was a """"normal"""" human being intermingling with people in civilization, though probably exaggerated thru time. So, what we need here is a book published before Autobiography of a Yogi saying that the Baba of Hariakhan is Lahiri Mahasaya's guru? What if I can provide that? I mean, maybe not verbatim but clearly implying that idea.

"International Symposium on Dr Axel Munthe

The second  international symposium on Dr Axel Munthe’s  life and work   will be held  on Saturday 13th of September at Hildasholm, Leksand, Sweden. 

From the Royal College of Physicians in London, Professor Ian McDonald (adjunct Prof Dept. Neurology, Yale University also Prof. Emeritus of Clinical Neurology, University College London will be speaking on the relationship between Dr Axel Munthe and the famous Professor Charcot of the Salpetriere in Paris.

The eminent architect, writers and former curator of Villa San Michele, Levente Erdeos will be giving a talk on “The makings of Villa San Michele, some connections to contemporary art and thinking”

Other distinguished speakers include the Swedish author, Bengt Jangfeldt,Dr Peter Cottino from Capri, Mårten Lindståhl, Sweden, Dr.Katriona Munthe-Lindgren from London, and Prof.Alden Smith, Department of Classics, Baylor University Texas, USA.

When Munthe received his medical degree in Paris in 1880 at the age of 23, he was the youngest Doctor of Medicine in Europe. His thesis was on the subject of gynaecology and obstetrics. Munthe had, however, been deeply impressed by the influential Professor Charcot in the field of neurology, and therefore already at an early stage was greatly interested in general diseases.

In the same year he opened his first practice in Paris, which was frequented mostly by members of the large Scandinavian colony of artists. He lived intermittently in Italy where he helped the cholera-stricken population (1880 on the island of Ischia, 1883 in Naples).

In 1887 Axel Munthe left Paris and settled in Anacapri where he worked as general practitioner. In 1890 he opened a practice in Rome where he was consulted by foreign dignitaries resident in Rome, as well as by Italian patients. He was appointed physician to the royal Swedish household to care for Crown Princess Victoria, later queen, from 1892 until her death in 1930.

During the First World War Axel Munthe served as a physician in the British Red Cross at the front in France. He described his activities in the book, Red Cross & Iron Cross, which was published in London in 1916.

Axel Munthe became a legendary physician who always gave free medical treatment to the poor. For some time he maintained a hospice for elderly, destitute people in a castle outside Rome. He was an outstanding psychologist who was extremely restrictive in prescribing treatment by drugs. The preferred forms of treatment prescribed by Munthe included hypnosis and therapy through music.

The Story of San Michele entirely overshadows all other publications by Axel Munthe, although it includes much of what he had already written earlier. His very first publications covered a number of travel discourses which appeared in the Stockholm newspaper, Stockholms Dagblad, and which described his experiences of relief work during the cholera epidemic in Naples. These discourses came out in book form in Sweden in 1885, in England in 1887, and later in 1910 in Italy. Subsequently he wrote a number of other papers and short stories which were later collected and published: for example, Små Skizzer, published in Stockholm in 1888; Vagaries, London 1898; Memories and Vagaries, London 1908; Bref och Skizzer, Stockholm 1909; En gammal bok om manniskor och djur, Stockholm 1931; Vagabondaggio, Milan 1933; Ein altes Buch von Menschen und Tieren, Leipzig 1934, etc.

Hildasholm, the house that Axel Munthe built for his bride in 1910-1911, was designed by the architect Torben Grut (who would later create the Stockholm stadium). It lies amongst the trees on the edge of Lake Siljan in the heart of Dalarna.

 Surrounded by gardens and pine woods it looks over the peaceful
waters and comprises Swedish, English and Italian furniture and paintings
from the 17th, 18th and 19th century Europe. It is still used by the family
while also being opened as a museum for the public during the summer
months. 

The gardens were created by Axel’s wife Hilda on the promontories
and in the ravines surrounding the house where suddenly the well ordered
English garden breaks into the wild and romantic natural environment.

 Comments on Mediation

 Major Restructuring 
Major resturcturing of this article was long overdue.  The article was almost entirely one long, long section, ironically called """"Overview"""".  I completely restructured this article to be more in line with the common Wikipedia structure used for other television programs.  Most notably The Simpsons and M*A*S*H (TV series) were used as examples of shows that were very popular and well organized.  I attempted to use logic in the categries and their order.  This reorganization was definitely needed, but it meant a lot of the content had to be moved around but I did not remove any content (yet) (except for correcting the episode of The Danny Thomas Show as being the pilot.  It was the basis for the a new show, possibly categoried as a spin-off, but it wasn't a pilot episode of TAGS).  

I added some new content but I did not remove existing content because I figured this restructuring was such a major change that I figured to take one step at a time.   Please note that I did not move everything.  All content that was not moved (most of it) was left where it was but the section was renamed """"Commentary"""".  I did not want to change too much all at once.  Much of that content is indeed commentary (not strictly factual) but some of it is still needs to be moved to more appropriate sections or deleted if duplicate information.
 

Thanks for the hard work.  I wanted to work on this some time ago, but because of the situation recounted above that went to the Mediation Cabal and the """"truce"""" proposed I have been reluctant to make any changes here.  Nice to see others are of the same mind.   

Yeah, it looks a lot better.  Just prior to its restructuring, I added a bunch of stuff to fill out the article, because it seemed a little light (for as popular a show as it is), and also simply because the Sheriff Andy Taylor link redirects here, but there was very little content about the character on this page.  But I didn't know where to put anything, so I just kind of stuck stuff here and there.  I hope I didn't add any duplicate information. Please feel free to move it around or take it out if it isn't necessary.  

 New (Big) Problem re: Episodes List 
The list of Andy Griffith episodes was apparently started in October 2005.  Many different people have worked hard on it, and it has always been the only episodes list linked to from The Andy Griffith Show.

As I was revising the structure of The Andy Griffith Show (see above) I noticed that the list of episodes was actually misnamed.  It is, and has always been, located at List of Andy Griffith Show episodes.  Please notice that the mistake is that the word """"The"""" was missing from the title (The name of the show is """"The Andy Griffith Show"""").  Noticing this I decided correct the problem by moving the article to include the word """"The"""" in the title, and I later planned on correcting the link on the main show's article.  However when I tried this I was surprised to discover that I couldn't do that because another article was already named List of The Andy Griffith Show episodes (with the """"The).

Through dumb luck (or bad luck) I discovered that another user had started creating an list of Andy Griffith episode on their own, under their username where nobody else knew it existed.  This article was started after the original and was basically hidden from others.  Just this month the user that created the alternate episodes list moved their article to List of The Andy Griffith Show episodes, although the main show's article still doesn't point to it.

So there's the situation.  We've got two lists of episodes.  What to do?  Pros and Cons while staying neutral:  The original list is mistitled but has always been the only list linked to from the main article at The Andy Griffith Show.  Because it was always public more different people have worked on it.  The newer article is almost as old but it was """"hidden"""" in a user area until just this month.  I will admit that the newer article looks nicer in style, structure, colors, etc. but IMHO I think the descriptions are better in the older, public list,",0.0

 Comparison, context, similarities to Energia 

This has very striking similarities to the Energia system, the concept of using a space shuttle system's hardware for launching other things isn't unique. There are obvious differences too, like stretching out everything and making it taller, whereas the Energia just uses multiple generic strap-ons, and the main engines were always on the bottom of the big tank for the Buran, so in the sls they have to move them across.

"Why it is so hard considering solipsism wrong? 

If even accepting that super-dubious statement of that 'The only thing i know existing is my mind'[1], and even further, accepting (blindly) conception of 'All of world can be my illusion', and then realising not all of world is directly controlled to you you think there's 'BUM'. But stop, you CAN'T know whether 'BUM' exists. Then, solipsist say 'world is my illusion' but HOW can one know IF the illusion EXISTS? If we state, that the only thing EXISTING is your mind, you can't go then stating something else exists, like even works of that mind. If you state [1], you live in nothing, but how parts of nothing can be different to each other?
But since you get 'The only thing i know existing is my mind' statement, and 'I think, therefore I am' conclusion i can ask four questions:
-Why if I THINK, then i am?
-Why it is stated that I THINK?
-Why I KNOW my mind exists?
-Why i know that my mind EXISTS?
those can be summed with:
-Why is my mind is supposed to be the ONLY thing to exist?
-Why i know only one thing exists?
-Why my mind is that the only thing existing? etc

 Why did Saturn fail??? 

I came to this entry to find out why GM is having to close Saturn - obviously decreasing sales - but why did this occur???  I would have thought that a new car company - away from the strangling management and unions of GM, started from scratch to compete against foreign small cars, would have been a winner - after all, the problem with GM/Detroit right now is that they don't make the right kind of cars, don't make small cars to compete with foreign small cars.  But this article tells me . . . . . absolutely nothing about what went wrong at Saturn.  Another useless Wikipedia entry.  I guess I'll have to go someplace else to find out what happened to Saturn.

Killer, I'm sorry that you have misread my unblock request. If you re-read it you will see that my use of """"pop-eyed chihuahua"""" there refers specifically, accurately and unequivocally to the dog displayed on your user page and not to you. I cited it to explain to why I used that imagery in the WP:PA, as otherwise it would appear inexplicably random. The explanation was not, as you seem to think, offered in mitigation. Indeed my original unblock request, which I condensed at the request of admin Hersfold, stated: 

The following will help the reviewing admin(s) to understand what otherwise would appear to be a random choice of metaphors.[...] Killer has a picture of a pop-eyed chihuahua dog on her user page,  captioned “I look like this”; and she is in the habit of referring to herself, in her sysopping summaries, as a dog   e.g. “Puppy has spoken.” Stupidly I exploited this canine imagery at Killer’s expense.'' 

I edited out that section along with others in an effort to comply with Hersfold's request.

My unblock request in no way implies that it is 'somehow OK to insult' you because you refer to yourself as 'puppy'. It simply explains where the idea for the canine imagery came from. It does not attempt to excuse my using it to insult you.

I'll have to take a closer look at the current version of the article, because I have an uneasy feeling that the answer actually is found in one of the subsidiary articles, such as Lydian mode. The short answer is that the connection between the Greek harmoniai and the medieval modes is more tenuous than you appear to believe, and the connection between medieval and modern modes is fairly straightforward. The """"modern system"""" is actually that of Common Practice Tonality, and """"modal"""" usage within that context begins to establish itself as a separate idea during the 18th century. The chief difference from medieval practice is a more rigid adherence to the diatonic notes of the scale. For example, in the medieval system, there is no practical difference between the Lydian scale and what we call the major scale, or between the Dorian and what we call the minor scale. In order to differentiate """"modal flavor"""" from the chromatic flexibility of the upper half of the minor scale, for example, it became necessary to insist on always using the minor-seventh scale degree, especially in ascent to the tonic, and the sixth degree had to be always major to identify Dorian, and always minor to identify Aeolian. No such practice existed up to the 16th century, and indeed it was only with Glareanus in the mid-16th century that a theoretical difference was made between Dorian and Aeolian on the one hand, and Lydian and Ionian on the other. I shall see what I can do to clear this up (using reliable sources, of course).—  """,0.0

Alright, Ched; I can see you are a reasonable person, and I appreciate you taking the time to reply.  I admit that I have taken this too far.  Some of it is an attempt to flush people out and try to understand what is happening.  I have made dozens of edits to to wikipedia over the years (usually not logged in) and I do try to improve it.  It's a great resource; we all know that.  I've had a very small percentage of my edits reverted over the years and it never bothered me.  To give a little history: I read the article and towards the bottom it mentions (2 sources, btw) how 2 Indians were shot, killed, and eaten.  I thought to myself, """"wow, that's pretty surprising; I had always heard that no one was murdered and they just ate people who had died naturally.  I should probably try to emphasize this so other people see it too without having to read down 30 paragraphs.""""  It seems to me that there is quite a difference between eating someone who's already dead, and killing someone to eat them.  Call me crazy.  Anyway, first I added a subheading and also put a mention in the opening paragraph.  I acknowledge that adding it to the opening paragraph was probably overkill, but doesn't this incident at least deserve its own sub-heading?  I challenge you to find the mention of the killings in the current article.  It is very difficult to find without reading the entire article.  And how many times in modern history have people in the USA been killed so they could be eaten?  I suggest to you that this is a noteworthy and highly unusual event.  Anyway, I will stop now.

"""==Additions to Origins: The Subjects==
I feel that it would be effective, either in its own section or within Origins, to expand on the audiences that ethnographic films are geared towards.  The article now seems to focus well on the aesthetic and historical context and the scientific research and study that can be done.  However, it is only slightly mentioned through  """"Nai, the Story of a !Kung Woman"""" on how the actual subjects or indigenous tribes react-to and can utilize this film.

In order to expand on this topic, I was thinking of a rough statement like this would be ideal:

Indigenous tribes and people often have clearly defined practical reasons for participating in ethnographic films.  Such reasons include creating a record of their lives for future generations, warning authorities of potential problems, exchanging cultural information with other cultural groups and educating dominant cultures.Aufderheide, Patricia. Documentary Film: A Very Short Introduction. Oxford University Press, 2007.  An ethnographic film by indigenous creators can also concentrate heavily on a particular movement towards indigenous activism.  The way an activist approach is accomplished is when filmmakers approach the issue with a tactic of openness, which ultimately no longer makes the camera a transparent object and instead an actor on stage that is allowed to be lead by its subjects.Aufderheide, Patricia. Documentary Film: A Very Short Introduction. Oxford University Press, 2007

(2)  The Quackbuster manipulation of Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia: 

Wikipedia is an odd thing.  It is made up of a so-called """"volunteer system.""""  Several years ago, a team of quackbusters infiltrated various levels of the Wikipedia operation, and are now entrenched in the middle, and lower, level volunteer management system.  If you try and put any positive information about advanced medicine, or the problems of US health care, on Wikipedia, or change false or misleading information the quackbusters have installed, you will fail.  You will be blocked from further """"editing"""" and the pages of Wikipedia will now carry information about what a """"terrible person you are.""""  The only way to have ANY influence over what Wikipedia says about  subject is to approach them with a legal threat letter at the highest levels.  Nothing else works.  Even that has problems, for Wikipedia management operates on a financial shoestring, and apparently has no ability to police its own encyclopedia.  Unfortunately, people use the encyclopedia - and they get very bad information about health care.

Below is a paragraph from the editor’s section of Wikipedia.  The editor, here, is discussing the problem of the quackbuster slime, acting to control the information flow on Wikipedia - and what to do about it.  so you understand the abbreviation POV stand for Point of View, and NPOV stands for No Point of View, which Wikipedia wants.  The part in red is for emphasis. Read this:

I guess it depends on what purpose the External Links section serves. Do the links have to serve the NPOV interests of the article or can the links section be a place where specific points-of-view can have a chance to be expressed? As it is now, the chiropractic link section is broken down into Advocacy and Critiques. I think that this warns the researcher that they are leaving the NPOV environment that Wikipedia tries to provide and will be entering a POV external site.

If these links are truly just linking to the page for marketing reasons and don't serve a primary function of adding to the knowledge-base, I would then say to axe them. I haven't checked every critical link, but they do seem to link to essays or research on pages that don't directly try to sell you anything (other than their POV). If they are all offering the same POV with no really distinguishing differences, then they should be reduced in number.

The soapbox point is interesting. These are external links so it would seem that Wikipedia is not being directly exploited as a soapbox. However, the abundance of critical links could be seen as an attempt to present bias... using the amount of negative criticisms to invoke a negative POV about chiropractic. My solution up until now has been to add to the advocacy links to balance out the criticism. You can certainly try to delete the critical links and claim NPOV but I can almost guarantee you that you be quickly (and improperly) accused of """"vandalism"""" by one of three specific chiroskeptics who police the chiropractic page all day long as far as I can tell. They love to throw """"vandalism"""" accusations around - and usually are vastly overstating the matter. That being said, I have suggested a """"disarming"""" strategy, where both sides would remove links in a balanced way, but my suggestion was met with silence.

Now as far as the link farming goes. Yes, virtually all of the critical sites are linked together through the SkepticRing, Anti-Quackery Ring, Chiropractic Subluxated Ring and other ways fashioned specifically for the purpose of boosting Search Engine ranking. A lot of those sites are operated by Stephen Barrett and his buddy Sammy Homola - Chirobase.org, Quackwatch.org, and NCAHF. They're three organizations all saying the same thing. What's really slimy is that they state opinions then reference their sister-sites support to that opinion. A lot of the links are operated or moderated by Fyslee (one of the three chiroskepics users who regularly accuse people of vandalism for removing links to his sites). Check out his userpage to see which sites he operates and moderates for. These chiroskepitics are working together to actively employ search engine tricks such as artifically boosting Google ranking by adding external links to their sites all over Wikipedia. I have documented this. Their goal is for a researcher curious about chiropractic to encounter their anti-chiropractic sites first on a Google search. Given these organizations' objective, I can certainly understand why they would want to do this. Unfortunately, the tactics that they employ are objectionable to both Google and Wikipedia. Hopefully these organizations will get wise to the chiroskeptic ring and ban their sites.

I'm not sure what to do in the meantime. One thing that I would like to suggest is that a website is linked to only once in the external links section. As",0.0

Hi. I don't think the article is too far off FAC now; I've added about 20,000 bytes since the peer review closed. In hindsight, I should have left the PR until after I got the Stoneman book, but I didn't think I'd get much from it (Stoneman has a COI in that he was the head of the Irish Film Board at the time and essentially greenlit the film). Used carefully, however, it's been a real goldmine of production information. I'm still working my way through it, but I don't think there'll be too much else to add other than fine detail; he does tackle the 18 specific points of contention from the petition, but I'll probably err on the side of caution and leave that for the existing sources, which have a little more distance from the subject. Of course, I won't take it to FAC without consulting on its talk page first. Sorry to hear about your back; I really hope it clears up soon (and that the drugs are at least offering some measure of fun; if they're not ... get better drugs!). Best,  T • C

On the plus side, I've now got the experience of seeing an otherwise excellent article receiving little input because it's on a niche subject. I couldn't have done it without your help; and the same goes for the other editors, who charitably stood aside when I arrogantly started throwing my weight around and rewriting the thing.

I guessed that'd be the case; I know you'd have liked the article to be a little lot more scathing, but had I taken that route I don't think it would have come as far as it has. Instead, the only option was to give enough information about both views of the film to allow intelligent readers to make up their own minds. I think it pretty much does that. As an aside, I'm currently in e-mail correspondence with Stoneman, who says he'll dig into his boxes of material to see if there's anything I can use to clear up Jayen466's last unresolved comment about the conclusion to the BBC investigation.

 My position on the two Irelands, using Arbcom and admin abuse 

I give my views on the two Irelands in the paragraphs below, but I will begin with what I feel is most serious.

I've had a look back, and IMO, there is one thing in particular I that is pressing for Wikipedia's future here:

The admin User:Deacon of Pndapetzim must have his adminship fully questioned in the correct place. No one has a chance on Wikipedia when an admin acts (and wheel wars) like he has done – and I believe he has overstepped the line, and made a difficult but legal situation into a nightmare situation for everyone. I warned him of the mayhem that would be caused if Ireland was simply reverted into being a cultural all-island article, but he ignored me. This edit note (and selective deletion) is an example of the kind of intellectual demeaning by admin that lead to me losing my own temper. You cannot treat adults like children. It shows feelings of superiority in being an admin - which must not be condoned. Aside from his attitude, the way he reversed admin Tariqabjotu's Ireland Move, citing a very small hand-picked selection of admin who share his personal position on this - to his own personal wishes, was totally unacceptable. Where were all the other admin I saw who spoke up? For reasons I give after after I get the following paragraph off my chest, he completely shattered Wikipedia for me when he did that, and his reasoning for doing it showed it to be nothing other than an act of hypocrisy, as well as self interest. Arbitration are not there to be interested themselves (by their own admission) - they are only there to be there, and there is nowhere else now to to go. It has all been completely messed up now – so Arbcom has to be pulled in.

I regret that I am leaving Wikipedia with the worse kind of people in my mind, in a place that is actually full of fantastic unacknowledged philanthropy. I won't go the way of saying what I (100%, in all good faith, IMHO, genuinely, without doubt etc, etc) honestly think this is comparable to - people call it a 'Godwin', a commonly-used term which belittles the technical purity of the very example - an early internet 'battle' won by some clever person, for sure. But you have to think beyond the cliche. The talk-page admin 'cop out' over any car crash, is normally to pretend this place is just a pastime, but WIkipedia is a little more important than that - no? And conspiracy theorising - don't point that one at me – it us such an ugly slur. Who needs those, when you give ‘’individuals’’ so much power? People group - they always do. The only 'conspiracy' could be within wondering why Wikipedia has to be structured in this way. It's a Sunday drive, and includes the world - but anything difficult like this? The structure simply breaks down. So do some people want a loose ship? A negative answer would have little to do with the Irelands anyway.

Two wrongs don't make a right, and equally bad is a wrong made after a right. Now how was Deacon right? The first move to Ireland disam/(state)/(island) was rational and sound 'policy-over-polling', the reversal (in the horrendous way it was done) was wrong in every possible way. Those who were interested in doing so, simply needed to re-debate it from where it was (perhaps prove it in a global poll?). But why should I do even more work towards facilitating that? I have given hundreds of hours of my life to this already. And where now were those originally opposing? A number of them were addressing new content. The carefully avoided truth is that a global poll (so hard to bring about – I know, as I’ve tried) would simply bring in changes. I gave my time editing the changes I saw before me, and my work has been cynically thrown down the drain. And look at the edit frenzy now! Too few admin actually give a shit when people's time is wasted. The reversal of tariqabjotus's move has vindicated every troll, SPA, contentious editor, sock-maker and IP-abuser watching, who in this Ireland problem, are the worker-minions of the wholly-debilitating 'dual Irish country' """"solution"""".

Ireland isn't Palestine, it isn't the People's Republic of China, it's just a country commonly called 'Ireland' on an island which has two states on it (one with a sea divide) - called Ireland - and Wikipedia, despite the efforts of so many, hasn't been allowed to properly address and present that undeniable fact. The Irish country now has two time-sharing homes again - two mixed-up modern-day country articles, one of them subsuming part of a separate country altogether - simply because it shares the island. Silly non-policy arguments about where to put historical 'Ireland's aside, there has always been an Irish nation (covering all or most",0.0

 I just wanted to say . . . 

that you were a horrid admin and really mean person. You lacked focus, commitment and neutrality. I'm jolly glad you're semi-retired and I'll dance the day you're de-sysopped. But, in a spirit of fairness, it'll be a dance of your choice.

I couldn't care less if you're jolly, but you can save the dancing for the day I retire, which may be today, and I recommend holding your breath until I'm desysoped... since it won't happen. I've never abused my tools, nor would I. Not to mention, it's practically impossible to desysop an admin here. I do plan to resign though, so you can dance for that too. But just know this...

 Perpetual Virginity 

The article currently states: """"After giving birth to Christ, Mary did have sexual relations,"""" and """"In the little time that Joseph was still around after the birth of and they had several more children.""""  Certainly some people believe these assertions, but they don't belong in an article that presents the Roman Catholic Church's Marian dogmas.

The article also says that: """"Mary did break her vow by the grace of God.""""  The writer seems to mean that God gave Mary a free pass to have sex but remain a virgin.  That really needs a citation, because I've never heard anything like it.  The RC Church teaches that Mary was really and truly a virgin her whole life, and other people believe she had sex and bore children, but as far as I know, no one teaches that she had sex, but God was okay with it, so we call her a virgin anyway.  Without a citation, this statement should go.

Sorry to disagree again, but the article in question clearly puts the story forth as what each side says. (Narconon says drugs can be sweated out, doctors say no, etc.) How Dr. Touretzky took the story is not actually relevant, more on that at the end.
There are four basic """"sides"""" depicted in it, on one side Narconon and Scientology on the opposite Science and Ex-members/critics. The stuff on Touretzky's site is supported by the latter, and disputed by the former. To a neutral observer, like the Chronicle, it's a subject of controversy. (That's what ChrisO was saying.)
To explain why Dr. Touretzky's opinion of the story is irrelevant, I'll compare it to a reverse hypothetical situation; lets say Narconon felt that they had been quoted out of context. Both arguments are equally invalid since a paper isn't expected to publish what the subject wants published. (Actually, it's really similar to the lawsuit Barbara Schwarz filed against the Salt Lake City Tribune when they published her story and interview.)  

 On POV expressed in this and related articles on Wikipedia 

Incidentally, this article is an excellent example of the best case scenario of POV in a CoS/Hubbard article. It presents both sides arguments without additional comment by the paper, but unlike the Narconon/CoS claims, proof exists to back the assertions made by science. For example *Narco/tology's belief that all drugs have long longevity in fat, scrambling of 3D pictures, etc. compared to tests on human fat showing otherwise and the 3D picture theory to be unproven.
*Narconon and Scientology are for the purposes of the US Government separate entities and this abbreviation is not meant to imply otherwise. They do however share similar vocabulary and ideas, and when describing these I have chosen to abbreviate.  """,0.0

@N-HHIts all about what a man can or can not do, N-HH. You can accept that this article is about a historical military-administered territory officially named """"Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia"""", or you can not. Me, I can ignore your PA comments, but I can't agree that the title should be changed to any phrase that doesn't refer in some way to this said territory, which is the subject of the article. Savvy?
As for your grammar concerns, you should probably make it clear which classes of words you consider too irrelevant to enter our considerations. Though I certainly hope you are clear on the difference between the words """"of"""" and """"in"""", and how they may alter the sentence. As in """"I was sick of this one year ago"""", and """"I was sick in this one year ago"""". 

@FkpCascais. Oh please, Fkp. Its me. The """"I'm insulted he hinted I'm a nationalist"""" thing is so old it """"has a beard"""" as we say 'round these parts. I know you so long I can produce a half-dozen diffs at any time to show an editing pattern as the one I hinted at. And no, this isn't a """"fake Serbia"""" like the NDH was a fake Croatia, it was a military occupation zone """"in Serbia"""", the """"Serbia"""" referred to there is just a geographic qualification indicating where this entity is located in. You need to clear from your head all that """"Nedićeva Srbija"""" nonsense that they teach us in grade school. The Serbian article actually has a flag and coat of arms under an infobox title that says """"Serbia"""", and you just called this a """"country"""". I'll say it again: this is an occupation zone created by Hitler, where his army picked some willing stooges to run the police and collect taxes/steal food. Hitler hated Serbs with a passion and didn't give them anything even closely resembling a country. It takes a special kind of crazy to go around fighting for recognition screaming """"hey, don't you go denigrating Serbia! we were just as much Nazi puppets as you were!"""". Yet that is exactly what I've been reading here for years on end. So forgive me if I'm a little sick of it.

@Peacemaker, I challenge your assertion that there is no WP:COMMONNAME for this territory, and claim 'Military Administration in Serbia' is a name used on a wide-enough basis to qualify as such.   (talk) """,0.0

"As with all coins, the value depends on the condition of a coin, its rarity, and the state of the market  the rarest coin will be worth nothing if no-one wants to buy it where it is being offered for sale.

That said, the British grading system for coins works like this (I will not touch the lunatic American grading system with 70 different grades!):-

 Poor coins are very worn, and most of the detail of the coin will have gone, but you're still able to tell what type of coin it is.
 Fair coins are well worn, but more of the detail of the coin is visible, and it is easy to identify the coin.
 Good coins will have almost all the lettering readable, and the date will be easy to read in most cases.
 Very Good coins  will have all the coin readable, and some of the finer details of the design can start to be made out.
 Fine coins will have the details of the coins taking shape, and the coin is starting to become collectable if it's fairly recent.
 Very Fine coins will have all the details clear, and there will be wear only on the high points of the design, and most of the fine details shows clearly.
 Extremely Fine coins will have wear on only the highest points of the design.
 Uncirculated coins will have no wear on the high points of the design at all, though faults in the engraving, or wear on the die, may mean that the design may not be fully struck.

 Under no circumstances should collectible coins be cleaned or polished  this will destroy at least half its' collectible value.

Coming back to your 1862 penny, values for a bog-standard penny in UK Pounds, in Britain, are:

F - GBP 4
VF - GBP 10
EF - GBP 40
UNC - GBP 70

Lower grades are not worth anything much.

Multiply by 1.6 to get a US $ figure, then discount any amount for reduced interest in the coins in the States!

 I have  read various pieces by Dr Mehdi Khaz'ali and listened to various  interviews with him, and must say that he comes over as a fantasist. He  just says things that some people badly want to hear, and that seems to  be the only thing that keeps him afloat in the media. Regarding Mr  Ahmadinejad not having served in the War, it is not true, but from a  technical point of view Mr Khaz'ali's story may contain some element of  truth. The fact is that Mr Ahmadinejad was not fighting as a regular  army soldier or officer, but was working party as a military logistic  engineer and partly as a military intelligence officer from behind  enemy's line. If my memory is not failing, during the War years he spent  some time in Kirkuk,  Iraq, amongst members of the Patriotic  Union of Kurdistan or Kurdistan  Democratic Party of Iraq  - both groups  were fighting alongside Iran against Saddam Hossein. The fact that after  the War he, i.e. Mr Ahmadinejad, became the Deputy to Governor-General of Maku  and Khoy  (West Azarbaijan Province has a sizeable Kurdish  population), and later Advisor to Governor-General of Kurdistan,  have direct relationship to his War-time experience in Iraqi Kurdistan.  Thus, indeed Mr Mohsen Rezai may not have been technically wrong in  saying that Mr Ahmadinejad has not been """"at the front"""" (assuming that  indeed the alleged statement is due to Mr Rezai), but to say that Mr  Ahmadinejad has lied about his War efforts, is just a false and  defamatory statement. Let us assume for a moment that Mr Ahmadinejad has  lied about his War efforts. Is it at all conceivable that a young man  from Tehran would get so early on so high up in the highest  administrative offices of Maku, Khoy and Kurdistan, from all places? As I  said earlier, Mehdi Khaz'ali is just a fantasist who seems to believe  in his own fantasies (there are some videos on YouTube  in which he says things that no one in his position could possibly  know).

You don't give constructive indications as to how to improve the material. As to primary sources, again, this is what Wiki says:
Primary sources that have been reliably published (for example, by a university press or mainstream newspaper) may be used in Wikipedia, but only with care, because it is easy to misuse them. Any interpretation of primary source material requires a reliable secondary source for that interpretation. Without a secondary source, a primary source may be used only to make descriptive claims, the accuracy of which is verifiable by a reasonable, educated person without specialist knowledge. For example, an article about a novel may cite passages from the novel to describe the plot, but any interpretation of those passages needs a secondary source.

Manchus

In April you reverted my edits with the comment that """"This paragraph was vandalized from previous revisions. It drastically changed from its original source."""".

Whether the changes are justified or not, they were not vandalism as they were explained at the discussion page for Manchus (""""Manchus and political football""""). Before reverting edits on the strength of charges of vandalism, I would be grateful if you could check the talk page and first address arguments made there.

My objection to the statement that """"Much recent scholarship in ethnic identity emphasizes that ethnic categories, rather than being static and objective, are fluid and subjective"""" is the fact that this could apply to ANY ethnic group, and could thus be placed at any article on any ethnic group. Making this specific point only at the article on the Manchus sounds like a rationalisation or excuse. It sounds highly defensive, as though there is no real basis for asserting Manchu ethnic identity other than the over-subtle distinctions of academics. We know that Crossley argued from this point of view, but is it necessary to incorporate this in the article? It's almost as if the article were saying """"We know the Manchus are not considered an ethnic group, but if ethnicities are regarded as fluid and subjective, we can perhaps recognise them as such"""". 

The Qing dynasty was based on an apartheid-like situation where the Chinese and Manchus were kept apart. During the Qing the Manchus retained a consciousness of being a separate ethnic group, even after they mostly switched to speaking Chinese. There are still Manchus today who retain a consciousness of the separateness of Manchu culture, quite apart from the state-sponsored ethnic categories. So my point is, why do we have to bend over backwards to try and justify a viewpoint simply because it is at odds with the current consensus? Is there a need to be so pointedly defensive just in the case of the Manchus?

Hello. First, thanks for your contributions; you're doing some nice work. There are a couple of things I've noticed with your templates that could be improved, however. When you created a new version of Template:Cosmology at Template:Physical cosmology, and then set the old template to redirect to it, you hid the history of the template. Where possible, please put the replacement template at the same location as the old one, or move the old one to the new name, then put the new code in place. (If you're worried about making a mistake on the new template and messing up the articles it's used on, then use a sandbox.) If you do that, then not only do you keep the history of the page, but you make it easier for those of us that are watching the template to see the latest changes to it (i.e. those during and after the replacement). I've requested a history merge on Template:Physical cosmology to fix this (which means an admin will come along and merge the histories of the templates at some point).

Also, please make sure that you don't add extra whitespace (new lines) into the template, as that also appears on the articles if it's not in a noinclude tag. See  for an example of what I mean; your version had two extra lines at the bottom of the article, which were appearing in the articles the template was used on, whereas the problem is now fixed.

Finally, please categorize the templates you make. There's a whole load of template categories under Category:Wikipedia templates; the two you're most likely to be interested in are Category:Physics templates and Category:Astronomical templates (and their subcategories). Categorizing the templates makes it a lot easier for other people to find (and then use) them.

 List of isms 

Banno, do you want to rethink the 'list of isms'.  Of course, there are some silly ones (""""cosmothetic idealism"""").  But some isms correspond to divisions that are relevant across the whole history of philosophy.  1.  Rationalism vs Empiricism, which begins with Parmenides and continues until today.  2.  Nominalism vs Realism, which begins with Aristotle, becomes the central question of the Middle Ages via Porphyry and Boethius, and is still alive today, very much so.  3.  Idealism vs Realism, and understanding of which is essential to any understanding of the Early Modern period.  Possibly Scepticism.

Why would Palpatine propagate his deformation by continuing to generate Force lightning? Some argue that he purposely disfigured himself to use as evidence against the Jedi in the Senate, and that given his personality, he wouldn't really mind the changes. How can one make such a presumption though? He's pure evil, we really don't know much else about him character wise. That's also part of what makes him so great, he's little more than evil personified... the Dark Side of the Force incarnate. Its far more likely that he looked like that before, the Dark Side corrupting his features over time. That would explain why his face looks perfectly symmetrical as a side effect of Dark Side abuse, rather than truely """"warped"""" all in one shot. Remember, Lucas didn't create Palpatine in ROTJ thinking, """"He's human, and he looks so hideous because Mace Windu played by Samuel L. Jackson in Revenge of the Sith demanded a larger role and wanted to claim responsibility for something important."""" When approached with a question asking him why the Emperor looks the way he does sometime after the release of ROTJ, Lucas answered that it was a side-effect of utilizing the Dark Side for so long over one's lifetime. He specifically likened it to cancer. They were originally going to make the change gradual over the course of the prequal trilogy, as exemplified by AOTC. As you can see, all of the makeup that made him look older in AOTC was not present in ROTS. Reason? Samuel L. Jackson. He had to whine and complain about having an impact and not getting killed by Clone Troopers like all of the other Jedi. George got him to shut up by having a not-so-noble death, and having it look like he beat Palpatine in a duel (specific quotes from Nick Gillard in the Making Of Revenge of the Sith book indicate that Palpatine acted the whole thing out, PERIOD. He even stressed it to the point where he suggested Ian add, """"SUCKER!"""" to the his dialogue) Yeah right, all of the smart fans know better.

I think that Kintetsubuffalo/Chris has a good point when he says that the article """"reads more like a family genealogy"""", but I don't think that the solution is to trim out the less notable people.   On the contrary, they have a place in the story of the family, but the significance of their role intends up being uninentionally overstated by the article's structure.
The genealogy is clearly an important part of the article, but I suggest that it should be at the bottom of the article, in the place where an appendix would be in a book. What the article needs, I suggest, is a clear narrative,  telling of the story of the family's activities. That could be done either thematically (e.g. politics, medicine, industry) or chronologically, or maybe by a combination of both approaches.
Vernon has clearly done a lot of excellent research, and has plenty of useful material with which to tell the story here, and I would really enjoy reading the story once it's written up.  I have been looking for a few articles which might serve as examples of how this might be done, and found a few which might help:
Rothschild banking family of England (the best I found)
Bulmer (family) (a much weaker article but it tells a story)
Mitford family (narrative a bit short, but heading in the right direction)
German sisters (more integrated than the Mitfords)
Smalbroke family (chronologially ordered, and somewhat genealogical in focus, but does tell a story)

Edits by Keraunos

Hi, Keraunos. I see you added to, and rearranged, some of this article. I ameliorated some of your additions for accuracy. Below are listed my ameliorations of your edits and my reasons for them:

 You added the edit """"because the temperature of the cosmos rising toward infinity as the final singularity of the big crunch is approached will provide a potentially infinite amount of energy to power the cosmic supercomputer.""""

I take it that what you tried to explain here is the energy resource. But actually, that isn't physically accurate. The universal heat diverging to infinity doesn't provide usable energy. Where the usable energy comes from is the gravitational shear (i.e., the universe's Taublike collapses along different axes with each cycle, called Mixmaster oscillations), which provides a temperature differential across the universe whereby usable energy can be obtained. Hence, I went ahead and cut this edit of yours.

If people read further into the body of the article, under the section """"Outline of the physics of the Omega Point Theory,"""" some of this is already explained, with references provided for further research (with a number of the references available online for free).

 You added a bit into here: """"the Omega Point represents the resurrection of the dead followed by an infinite-duration afterlife as an avatar in cyberspace, which could take any imaginable form within the metaverse of the cosmic supercomputer due to its virtual nature.""""

I kept the ressurection link. I understand from reading your user page that you're into science fiction and transhumanism, but one should avoid loading up this article with needless science fiction terminology and transhumanist terminology, as well as computer terminology which isn't that accurate (such as """"avatar""""). The term preceding your edits, """"simulated reality,"""" already expresses the ideas you're getting at, and people can follow that hyperlinked text if they're not sure what that means.

 You added most of this: """"engulfed by artificially intelligent life as it approaches the point of maximum expansion, which, according to Tipler, will occur 'between 5 X 10^16 and 5 X 10^18 years from now (in proper time)'.""""

One should be more accurate in their terminology, as most people think of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as meaning intelligence via artifically created programs. Yet if uploaded human consciousnesses become a reality, then the programs of their minds would be natural, but on an artificial substrate. Hence, I'm changing this to """"From that point on, the entire visible universe would be engulfed by these 'mind children' as it approaches the point of maximum expansion,"""" with """"mind children"""" referring to the previously defined mention of the term.

I also removed your quote of Tipler's estimation as to when the universe will be engulfed, as that is from his 1994 book The Physics of Immortality, yet later cosmological observations have been able to define the Hubble shift more accurately, which is what that estimation is based on. So Tipler's current estimation is different now. For more on that, see:

F. J. Tipler, """"The structure of the world from pure numbers,"""" Reports on Progress in Physics, Vol. 68, No. 4 (April 2005), pp. 897-964. See also here. Also released as """"Feynman-Weinberg Quantum Gravity and the Extended Standard Model as a Theory of Everything,"""" arXiv:0704.3276, April 24, 2007.

 You added the section """"Criticism from string theory.""""

I kept pretty much all of this, while editing it slightly to improve the style and formatting. I changed the section title to """"Implications from string theory,"""" since Brian Greene doesn't actually offer any criticism of, or even refer to, Tipler's Omega Point Theory in Greene's book that you referenced.

This section, as it stands now, might have to go entirely, as it appears to fall under Wikipedia's rule concerning original research. As it's written, it's a valid deduction that the Omega Point singularity would be obviated if string theory disallows singularities and if string theory is true, but it's an original deduction.

 You moved the """"See also"""" section to underneath the references. You also added a number of links therein.

Based upon Wikipedia's """"Featured articles,"""" it appears that the preferred location of the """"See also"""" section is where it was previously, before the references. Hence, I moved it back.

On Boeing 787 there are 8 different aircrafts in the specs. I believe we should remove all of them. Have a nice 3 table specification chart on the 787-3 787-8 787-9 and thats it. We can even bring the 3-way cross section of the 787 right next to this spec chart. I believe articles need to be stand alone and comparing it to everything diminishes this. Why not add Ilyushin il-96 here too then? Or many other aircaft. The 787 article is very very poorly done. Its not an encyclopedic entry. Its simply a collection of newsbits. It has become a forum to bash the A350 or even the A380. As soon as a story comes out, somebody writes a paragraph there. I have been doing some updates and I want to know if you agree about making the article more about the 787 and less about other planes.  
 Hey, going OK here.  I can see both sides on the comparison chart.  2 planes (one smaller and one larger) for comparson is enough.  It'd be OK to remove non-787 planes since other airliner articles don't have them.  The fact this is a new plane helps causes lower quality in the article, I think.  People spend more time just adding info than cleaning it up and all.  I'll keep an eye on it and do what I can.  Take it easy Bangabalunga.  - 

 747-8 Speed 

You are correct!
It was .85 and .845 on Boeing last week. I dont know when they changed it.
I know that wind tunnel testing has not gone well and the 747-8 will have more drag than 747-400 but I guess in order
to have bragging rights against the A380, they must be faster.
I am sure airlines will still cruise at 0.845 though in the Intercontinental just to be efficient.
Take care  
 No problem.  The 747 has had a cruise speed of Mach 0.85 for some time.  Don't think there's not that much a difference there.  Good catch on the upper deck 3/10 windows thing.  I was confused before.  - 

Hughes Helicopters
Some user slapped a {notability} tag on the Hughes Helicopters article. I removed it (to get his attention, as some people don't read the talk pages), and posted comments on the talk page also. I don't know what his problem with the page is, but it might be that it's unsourced. He just put the unreferenced tag up today, so it's not like noone won't know that's a problem. Can you take a look, and see what you think? Thanks. -  
 Sure.  Will do.  - 

Inlet geometry
On F/A-18 Hornet, you added the F-16 as having variable inlet geometry. I always understood that it was fixed on the F-16, and I can have several printed sources on that. Has that been changed on later F-16s? -  
 I only reverted a change where the F-4 replaced the F-16 in this sentence: The engine air intake of the Hornet is notable among its contemporaries for being """"fixed"""", unlike the F-14, F-15, and F-16 which have variable geometry or variable ramp engine air intakes..  The F-4 is from an earlier era.  Please correct that if needed.  Thanks. - 

OK. I didn't check the earlier history. I just wanted to ask first to find out why it there in case you had a reason, and now I know. I'll take it out. THanks. - [[Use",0.0

First of all, Oscar Schindler was a true hero who saved thousands of people from imminent death by risking his life in the heart of the Nazi Germany. With no unintended disrespect for Mr.Winton, he merely sat in his hotel room and wrote ads to newspapers. Secondly, Schindler's heroism is widely recognized all over the world, while Winton is mostly known by the British who are extremely well-known for loudly bragging about things they never accomplished. He is a purely media-made hero. And third of all, the children he saved were thrown out of their homes in Britain as soon as the war ended. And judging by the numerous published cases of abuse of evacuated British children in their adoptive homes, how those Czechoslovakian children were treated in their British homes would be an interesting investigation.

I regret that it has been changed back. I think I have written a clear and correct representation of metahysical libertarianism. Now the passage seems to say again that metaphysical libertarians require a belief in a soul. This is a falsehood of such magnitude which cannot pass. To require a belief in a soul and implicitly require belief in God is anti-democratic, anti-freedom, anti-emotion, anti-religion. Very clearly in metaphysical libertarianism the way to arrive at a conclusion about an agent is by free belief. I have quoted 2 metaphysical libertarian philosophers previously going out of their way saying that they are opposed to evidence, even against philosophical evidence in coming to a conclusion about the agent. But really ALL late medieval monks are generally considered to be metaphysical libertarians. It is also quite obvious that religion centers around FAITH, not around evidence gathering. So I think I have made a fair and correct representation of common metaphysical libertarianism.

But on the other side I do feel I need more support from people here on wiki that what I wrote is a correct and fair representation of common metaphysical libertarian position. Think this through, is the way in which metaphysical libertarianists reach a conclusion about an agent a free way, or a way forced by evidence?

"The basis for this article is an article in Fornvännen 1983 
http://fornvannen.se/pdf/1980talet/1983_021.pdf
This article was edited and approved by the previous editor of Fornvännen Fil Dr Jan-Peder Lamm 
Fornvännen is a highly reputable magazine
Göran H. wrote the article in 1982.  Jan-Peder Lamm edited the article but  suggested that Göran H. should include a comparison with Stonehenge. Therefore did J-P L supply Göran H. with archaeological history about Stonehenge. Göran H. re-wrote the article with comparison with Stonhenge and the article was published in 1983.

Jan-Peder Lamm, born 27 October 1935, is a Swedish archaeologist. He received his PhD in 1973 from the University of Stockholm for a dissertation about a Migration Period elite cemetery near Drottningholm.
Lamm taught archaeology at the University of Stockholm in the 1970s and then worked until retirement as Head Curator for the Swedish Iron Age at the Museum of National Antiquities in Stockholm. He is a member of the editorial board behind the journal Fornvännen and has taken active part in the Helgö project since the 1960s.
Fornvännen (print: ISSN 0015-7813, online: ISSN 1404-9430) is a Swedish academic journal in the fields of archaeology and Medieval art. It is published quarterly by the Royal Swedish Academy of Letters in Stockholm, Sweden. The journal's contributions are written in the Scandinavian languages, English, or German with summaries in English. Fornvännen has the alternate title Journal of Swedish Antiquarian Research. The editor in chief is Lars Larsson.
Fornvännen began publication in 1906 when it replaced two earlier journals, Svenska Fornminnesföreningens Tidskrift and Vitterhetsakademiens Månadsblad. Early contributors included noted archaeologists Oscar Montelius and Hans Hildebrand.[1] Since 2000 it has an online version, since 2007 its first 100 annual volumes have been available on-line, and since 2009 Fornvännen is published as a delayed open-access journal with the online version of each issue appearing six months after the paper version.
Fornvännen is an ERIH category B journal. According to Ulrich's, it is indexed in Anthropological Index Online, Anthropological Literature, British & Irish Archaeological Bibliography (Online Edition), Nordic Archaeological Abstracts, and FRANCIS. It was previously also indexed in Internationale Bibliographie der Rezensionen Geistes- und Sozialwissenschaftlicher Literatur and Linguistic Bibliography.[2]

Today I find recipes and their variations by query - not by my query of the computer but by the computer's query of me.

 The email controversy is in the wrong section

 Editing own comments 

In the context of misrepresentation, may I draw your attention to WP:Talk:

'Altering a comment after it has been replied to robs the reply of its original context. It can also be confusing. Before you change, consider taking one of the following steps:
 Contact the person(s) who replied (through their talk page) and ask if it is okay to delete or change your text.
 use strike-through or a place-holder to show the comment has been altered.
 Strike-through is typed like this and ends up like this.
 A placeholder is a phrase such as """"[Thoughtless and stupid comment removed by the author.]"""". This will ensure that your fellow editors' irritated responses still make sense. In turn, they may then wish to replace their reply with something like, """"[Irritated response to deleted comment removed. Apology accepted.]""""

Let me add that your ability to find POV errors, SlimVirgin, is not unlike NCdave's excellent skill. For example, when I first was asked how I thought of the page in the peer review or whatever they call it, I said it was OK. However, after I got to looking at NCdave's criticisms, and looked closer at the language and accuracy, I not only found 500-words, but like Dave, had to go above-and-beyond with additional comments. People like you and Dave (and Ruch Limbaugh) are my heroes for finding errors that are otherwise unnoticeable (and Wagon's not bad at this either, though his findings seem typically to sway more to the center or liberal left, in my opinion). Therefore, it is of high surprise that you couldn't find """"key issues,"""" either yourself, or those we've identified. (A folder of 500-word essays awaits you.) Likewise, when Uncle Ed was my own role model and example on how to solve a dispute, a method I successfully copied to be the """"great negotiator"""" and put out """"World War III"""" at the en.WikiQuotes.org """"Abortion"""" quotations weg page, it was likewise a surprise that Uncle Ed fancied himself the failure at negotiations, that had somewhat stalled: Talk:Terri_Schiavo/Mediation#Well.3F, """"It has been 4 days since the last contribution to this Mediation. Is everyone giving up, or what? I didn't feel particularly good about putting a user block on FuelWagon, but does that change anything?"""" Uncle Ed's only problems are having to deal with UNscreened employees (editor/writers), who are NOT paid employees (quality is """"you get what you pay for"""") and, none of us (far as I know) are paid. CONCLUSION: You all are my role models, and brighter than you may appear, so scratch for answers -and have a good time off, while Uncle Ed takes a wiki vacation -probably to work at a """"real, paying"""" job or rest up.

On the second occasion,  at least had the common courtesy to follow policy and provide an edit summary. Since the article was my contribution, and since I feel that Wikipedia should include an article on this subject, I am responding here.

The edit summary states: """"This page is nothing but WP:OR. There is no """"fallacy"""". Best as a redirect""""

The last point might have force if use/mention fallacies were defined on the redirect page, but they are not. Indeed, they are not mentioned at all. Furthermore, I can make no sense of the second point. Interpreted as """"there is no such recognised thing as a use/mention fallacy"""" it is obviously false, as can easily be shown by a google search (=use mention fallacy). The first ten results alone include citable examples dating back more than three decades. (Specifically, John R Searle's December 1976 review of """"Toward a Linguistic Theory of Speech Acts"""" by Jerrold M Sadock in Language: """"There seems to me to be several massive use-mention fallacies in this .... But this has the effect of building a persistent use-mention fallacy into ..."""") I don't want to insult Snalwibma's intelligence by implying he or she didn't bother to try this search, but I can't otherwise understand the criticism.

I'm less sure of my ground when it comes to the allegation of WP:OR. The example isn't mine, but I got it from the oral tradition (and changed 'nigger' to 'honky', mainly because I'm white myself), so can't cite anything to justify it. But I don't accept that inventing illustrative examples counts as WP:OR. If it did, the consequences for Wikipedia would be unfortunate, for whereas it might just be possible to quote a citable definition under fair use of copyright, quoting copyrighted examples is surely not on. So contributors must invent them if we are avoid an encyclopedia of merely abstract prose that only makes sense if you already know what it means.

The source used by the article was a press release from Pasternak‎'s lawyers. If we have the comment carried by reliable sources third party sources, then perhaps. But WP:BLP: """"Unsourced or poorly sourced contentious material about living persons—whether the material is negative, positive, or just questionable—should be removed immediately """" (emph added).  The Red Pen of Doom 
I was agreeing with your removal, so you don't have to justify it to me, but you're still wrong about who the source was from. It wasn't from his lawyers. It was from seeking alpha, and you summarized the edit as """"After Knight Trading: a press release from Pasternak's lawyers is not valid source for WP:PEACOCK language"""". I think you just didn't notice the reference with the seeking alpha site before the reference with the law firm site. 
Also, it is not an explicit policy to remove all sources that come from a client's law firm, particularly when they state facts about the disposition of a case. WP:RS does not indicate party-affiliated sources cannot be moved. In fact, it provides explicit guidelines for when its inclusion is appropriate (WP:SELFPUB). Also, the WP:BLP policy has two parts for removal of facts from a BLP: 1) the fact has to be unsourced or poorly sourced, and 2) the source must not be """"written by the subject of the BLP"""". In this case, it was written by [presumably] his lawyers. Either his lawyers stand in his shoes, and so it fails #1 (because it's poorly sourced by virtue of not being sufficiently second-party, a contention which isn't cut and dried) but meets #2 (because it's written by his represenatatives), or it doesn't fail #1 but does fail #2 (a strange place to be).

 Trinity 

Hi, Mark! I'm not committed to any particular wording. My concern is to find language that reflects the fact that there are more than a handful of exegetes that maintain that the doctrine of the Trinity is contained in the Scripture of the Old and New Testament. They would admit, of course, that the term """"Trinity"""" is not in the Bible and that the doctrinal formulas of later ages are not stated point blank. Yet they see the Scripture as a whole confessing one God, while confessing the Father as God, the Son as God under names such as """"The Angel of the Lord"""" and the """"Word of Yahweh"""" and the Holy Spirit as God. To me, """"some"""" gets to that. Without extensive research, however, I cannot say how many feel that way. What we do want to do is to either find language that includes them all or that sets forth the multiple positions on the subject. Peace in the Prince of Peace, Bob  Wyneken(talk) """,0.0
"""Pic ==

Ottoman, why was the picture removed? It is found in the archives. 

Do not blame me! -) I could not figure that out (why someone do not like the wording """"local defense line"""" especially most of them in daily cloths) plus the logic of other things (considerations other than the history, I guess) that is happening on this page. If this would be my history, I would not be reckless on my heroes. Whaetever.  

I removed it because I thought that it came from the Battle of Van and not the Van Resistance.   

Ottoman, could you please type the entire passage from Robert-Jan Dwork Holocaust: A History by Deborah and van Pelt, p. 38, that talks about the 1st Armenian Republic? This doesn't sound right, but I want to see where it's coming from. 
Nowhere on that page it talks about the first Armenian republic. It does indeed talk about the Armenians. It first talk about Max Scheubner, it also quote from him. Then talk about the ten commandments of the Ittihadists and the Turkish government plan of destruction of the entire Armenian community. Then, the only thing which is the closest to what Ottomanreference attribute to that page is this following passage: Through the use of centralized planning and modern communication systems, all Armenians were to be assaulted. For the Turks, the sole question was: When? They did not have long to wait. In spring of 1915, Russian troops invaded Turkish territory following a failed Turkish offensive in the Caucasus. Sensing the opportunity, nationalist Armenians established a provisional government in the Russian-occupied era. Here was the proof of the """"internal enemy"""" the Turks had long claimed them to be, and Enver Pasha, the Turkish minister of war, did not hesitate to... Then the rest of the page relate to the destruction of the Armenians. This is also another example of a footnote not supporting the text it is supposed to source.  (ix) 

The book is at the state library; I have a very short note. It says; """"page 38, the setting of the provisional government"""". It was in the introduction section of the book about Holocaust (Jews) and talking about WWI in general. Next time; when I am at library, I will get the text. But if there was more than this, I would have it in my notes.

 Mentorship 

Hi Sylvia. I'd certainly be happy to mentor you. I can provide as much or as little support as you need - If you'd just like a single point of contact for questions, I'll be able to help with that. If you'd like something a little more structured, I can even adopt you . I'd probably not recommend that option if you were not planning to hang around after the 6 weeks, so you can see how you feel and possibly join that later?

 The precise definition of race is under dispute 

I wrote this to help spread understanding, please make sure to read the definitions of outcrossing on the link.

There is a lot of misunderstanding of genetics and further there is a lot of misinformation that people spread because they WANT you to think that there is no difference between peoples for a political or social agenda, that does not make it so. Humans share 98% of our genetic code with Chimpanzees, yet that 2% defines our differences and is important as is the difference in the human population, no matter how small the difference.

There are obviously differences in the expressed traits between Asian, African and Caucasian. These are different types of humans, if you choose to call the a race/breed or type it's up to you and it's immaterial. My argument has always been that racial diversity should be preserved which is a more neutral position rather than promoting that race mixing and interbreeding is somehow positive.

You and many people that listen to pop culture may think that by interbreeding you are helping humanity and there are lots of myths about how you will create better offspring; offspring that have the best of both parents. This is just a myth told by people who, are trying to say that people are equal, if different. Yes, people are people as Americans we believe that all people have certain inalienable rights but the best position for humanity is for each of the races to exist, separately to be the best we can. If you truly understand the advantages that diversity offers you will agree too.

I personally breed horses. And this is where I'll start telling you a story: the Thoroughbred horse started out as a mixed race horse. It was based on Arab stock and was bred only for speed for many generations, regardless of breed, the horse that ran the race the fastest was bred to other fast horses. The Thoroughbred breeding book is now closed, which means you cannot breed a Thoroughbred to any other breed, because, ANY cross you make outside of the gene pool will reduce the speed of the horse. This is called line breeding, please read this article as a basic """"learn to breed"""" guideline: http://www.learntobreed.com/linebreeding.html. Line breeding(inbreeding) is a useful technique as is outcrossing when advantagous to produce quality results, random mixing is like a child finger-painting and does nothing positive.

What Wikipedia has been proposing is that random interbreeding is potentially a good idea and should be treated as potentially positive. Any person who knows about breeding animals will disagree, it's very unlikely that race mixing will result in a positive result unless it was planned for by a geneticist. When you cited the plant hybridization, that's what you were doing citing a hybrid that was designed in a laboratory and there were not human beings or living animals as a result of a genetic mistake. You can't through bad human crosses in the trash like you can with corn.""",0.0

Oh, and here is the response I posted, that got erased: 

REDVEЯS, I do not feel my comments are poisonous. Other people agree with me. The """"good editor"""" you describe is often very harsh in his dealings with others and seems to put his own personal pride ahead of common sense when he prevents pictures other than his from being used. As far as I know, most people on Wikipedia conceal their true identities including David Shankbone and yourself. To be called cowardly for merely highlighting the anonymity we all use is ridiculous. You say my criticism of David Shankbone is disgusting. What I find disgusting are his insensitive, uncaring, and simply awful author photos, and the egotistical ways he defends them.
And here is my response to you, David Shankbone: There's a difference between attending a public event and expecting a photo to appear for one day in a local newspaper, vs. having that event define your permanent image on a site as widely used as Wikipedia. Your animosity toward authors demonstrates your own lack of a NPOV. Your history with Sharyn November is more complicated than you describe. She at first repeatedly tried to take down the photo you took of her (as anyone can see in the history of her page), and it wasn't until you used intimidation (on a talk page I think, by implying she shouldn't even be writing on her page due to neutral point of view issues and might be blocked) that she immediately backed down and got friendly, clearly out of fear that you would block her. —Preceding unsigned comment added by Anonymous 374 (talk • contribs) """,0.14285714285714285

 I know you are writing these things in good faith, Yop, but your claim that Warren's skin or hair color calls into question her claim to Native ancestry is offensive. On that logic, the racial identity of everyone who identifies as racially mixed but 'looks white' should be questioned. The difference between Warren and 'white-looking' mixed people such as Mariah Carey and Rashida Jones is that the latter have actual, identifiable parents or grandparents who are racial minorities (African American). On the other hand, all of Warren's ancestors are white. That is why she was and is criticized for this: She said she was a """"minority"""" when her whole familyincluding distant ancestorsis lily-white. Finally, it is preposterous to suggest that Warren 'looks minority' in the picture you wish to insert in the article. She looks completely white in all pictures.

"Absolute Proof that 0.999... IS NOT EQUAL TO 1 
A math-wiki:

You are wrong about infinite representation. The ancient Greeks *never* represented 1/3 as 0.333... 

Now let me refute your argument regarding the transitive property:

A)    1=3(1/3)
B)    3(1/3) = 3(0.333...)
C)    3(0.333...) =0.999... 

The problem here occurs in B) where you assume that 3 * 0.333... = 3 * 1/3. You have 'not proved' anything. On the contrary, you have only proved that you are assuming 1/3 = 0.333... which it is obviously 'not equal'. 0.333... is an 'indeterminate' number because it cannot be represented finitely in base 10. 
0.333... is not equal to 1/3 so you cannot say that 1/3 is a finite representation. An indeterminate number is a number that is repeating in any
radix system.

You mention the division algorithm but do you know what it says? The division algorithm has 'nothing' to do with radix systems. Let me state it for you - If a and b are two given integers, there are unique integers q and r
such that a=bq + r and  0<= r < b. Now I will use the division algorithm to prove that you are WRONG once and for all. Suppose a = 1 and b = 0.999..., then 
what are the integers q and r such that the above is true?

Suppose that q = 0 and r = 1. Then the division algorithm fails because it makes a false statement i.e. q and r can both be 0 and 1 respectively.
For example: 1 = (0.999...)(1)+0 and 1 = (0.999...)(0)+1. So by default, the
division algorithm is proved false if 0.999... is equal to 1. And you can say a lot of things about the Greeks, but they would not make a stupid mistake like this. They were the smartest race in ancient times.

Now suppose that you try to tell me that either form is acceptable in the case of 0 and 1, you will still end up with a terrible contradiction:

1=(0.999...)(0)+1. The second form in this case implies that 1 < 0.999... since r < b. But how can 1 be less than 0.999... ??!!

I want the world to know what f..g idiots run this site. You are a bunch of retarded, conceited fools who I look upon with the utmost hatred and condemnation. Your site is absolute crap because it is run by fools like Michael
