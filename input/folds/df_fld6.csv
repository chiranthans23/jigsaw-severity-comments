Since this is not an article, but a sandbox draft, I don't know what to edit. I'll edit it here:

Note: You *almost got it right* but, the subject of the article is not the term, but the myth (or, shall we say controversy) about the term. The *argument* should be the subject.

""""Democrat Party"""" is a term used in the United States instead of """"Democratic Party"""" when referring to the Democratic National Committee. http://www.democrats.org/about/faq.html There is an ongoing dispute about the origins of this shorthand term, whether it is a natural shorthand expression, or whether it is derogatory to the party. A 1984 New York Times article suggested Republicans began to use the term when Democrats used their party name to infer """"they are the only true adherents of democracy.""""[1] New Yorker commentator Hendrik Hertzberg wrote that the term """"is a slur intended to ... express contempt.""""[2] He also stated that polling however indicated only """"deeply committed"""" Democrats found the term offensive.[2] Political analyst Charlie Cook attributed use of the term to force of habit rather than a deliberate epithet by Republicans.[3] Ruth Marcus stated that Republicans likely only continue to employ the term because Democrats dislike it.[2] Hertzberg and Marcus both state the use of the term is """"trivial"""".[2][3] [4]

History of usage
The earliest known use of the term, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, was by a London stock-market analyst, who wrote in 1890, """"Whether a little farmer from South Carolina named Tillman is going to rule the Democrat Party in America – yet it is this, and not output, on which the proximate value of silver depends.""""[5]

William Safire in [year] wrote about the use of the term, understood as a derogatory reference, and attributed it to Thomas Dewey who he credits with this usage.[6] The term gained popularity during the 1940 presidential campaign of Wendell Wilkie. Wilkie's campaign manager Harold Stassen said, regarding his use in the 1940s, that because the Democratic Party was controlled """"by Hague in New Jersey, Pendergast in Missouri and Kelly-Nash in Chicago, [it] should not be called a 'Democratic Party.' It should be called the 'Democrat Party.'""""[7]

Do you see the difference? All the way through, the dispute about the term should be the subject of the article, not whether it *really* means one thing or another.

"""

Wikipedia's founder, Jimmy Wales, has admitted that the much loved """"free encyclopedia"""" has at least some quality problems. To some of us, this is nothing new. I've had more than one student rely on Wikipedia for accurate information for a paper, and it always ends up the same way: """"well, I got it off of Wikipedia, thinking it was good..."""".

And therein lies the problem. If you keep in mind that anyone, and I mean anyone, can edit a Wikipedia entry, then you are treading on dangerous ground if you're going to cite it as a source of fact. While it's true that errors often get corrected, they don't always, and what happens in the meantime is that bad info sits there, misinforming people. Of course, this isn't true just in the case of Wikipedia. It's a problem online, in general. I recently was party to an argument over the historicity of Jesus, and one person used a source that claimed that Philo of Alexandria lived in Jerusalem. He's called Philo of Alexandria for a reason, you know.[] 

I used to be such an unadulterated fan of Wikipedia you know. The idea of an open source online reference that grew on a daily basis was quite an attractive one back in the day. But in recent times I've become wary of the encyclopaedia anyone can edit, and not simply because of a few high profile choice edits.

Whatever about libel and congressional cherry picking amidst the many articles of this once noble enterprise, what really gets me about Wikipedia is that I can't trust it on most issues. There are so many agendas, axes to grind and purely mischievous vandals that 90% of what I would be interested in reading about - history, politics and so on - is tripe. To read an article on a contentious subject one can pick out bias, attempted compromise and ultimate failure almost immediately. Wade into the """"Talk"""" page, where these edits are discussed, and you are confronted with chaos. There are too many vested interests at stake, and from the War on Terror to the Welfare State one will find an army of people taking one view or another entering into what are known as """"Revert Wars"""", where they revert any edits back to the version which suits them.

From self-interest to political interest one can find """"POV"""" (Point of View) shading almost every major article that touches on the live wires of our society. Thus I wouldn't trust anything that's even half-way current or ongoing on Wikipedia.

For one, the facts can be skewed. Secondly, the article can change overnight depending on how organised a campaign is launched against an article (and they do happen.)

The text will read.. 
Redemption movement proponent Barton Buhtz has written that when a UCC form is processed by a state's UCC filing office, it becomes a public legal record/fact and that those who have filed UCC-1 Financing Statements correctly have not broken the law. Buhtz states that no court can dispute the validity of a properly filed UCC-1 financing statement.

Treasury Tax and Loan (TTL) account. Buhtz makes it clear that the UCC Redemption Process is not merely a 'get rich quick' scheme, and also warns of potential imprisonment for those who fail to follow the law in regards to this process.

"That would violate WP:V, actually, if I understand your statement correctly. ?!? 

 (after ec) I do not understand your question as written, so I will simply explain UNDUE in a general way. Let's say, for example, we are writing about nails. An authoritative work about nails, written by an expert on nails, and used as a textbook, or source for a textbook about nails, would get a lot of weight - we would regard it as definitive. A differing view from a nail manufacturer's website would get considerably less weight, as would a newspaper article about nails. Finally, a politician or celebrity's comments about nails would get no weight at all, unless in their article, not the article on nails. And your cousin Bob's random comments on nails in his blog not only gets no weight, mentioning them on a talk page might be considered a violation of WP:FORUM. Giving a newspaper article the same weight as an authoritative text by an expert is a violation of UNDUE - you are giving a less important source undue weight. Applying this here, then medical texts on Abortion carry the most weight; other sources carry less and less weight the farther they move from authoritative sources.

 deletion of redirects per Wikipedia:Naming conventions (schools) 

The issue has gotten contentious for one redirect in particular for Uni High.  There's been an Rfd for days nowand I've said that I'd be fine with keeping it, but only if there was a particular reason to.  We are forming guideslines etc, and while a look at the ones in place helped form them, I'll definitely admit that I could have overlooked stuff.  But the current discussion has been going round and round and the person who wants the redirect kept is arguing two things (it seems).  One is that keeping the redirect will prevent article duplication.  And the other is that it will help people find the article.

In my point of view, both of these arguments make no sense, as the article in question was moved from name of school plus paramater to name of school plus different parameter.  There are half a dozen different paramaters that could be used easily, so the idea that people are going to naturally gravitate towards the one that did happen to exist and want to create an article there, or search that way doesn't make sense.  If the person really thinks that that's a problem, then they should have created other redirects from the other possible namespaces for the article.  If you could take a look at the discussionI'd appreciate it.  I may be missing something, we may want to change the guidelines per different things that have been raised (notability of the city was raised, which we don't outright address because I didn't think we would need to but we probably should).

Alsoit occured to me that there's no WP shortcut for the guideline, which I assume would belong at WP:NC(SCH).  We should create the shortcut, no?    talk  20:46, May 18 2007""",0.0

It turned into a dead-end...I said that on her talk page, and that I would not continue the topic there and I moved on.  
 Gwen as an administrator never implied she felt harassed and in fact said subsequently said she was """"not bothered"""" by my inquiry on the talkpage. (see: Trolling http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Gwen_Gale )
 Regardless, I finished my exchange, and told Gwen I was moving on, and I moved on.   It was after this, that Jehochman chose to indefinitely block me.  I don't understand how my action to discover why an admin blocked me, where a reviewing admin reversed that block...should cause me now to have an indefinite block.  It seems like double punishment...for asking for clarification.  I will form the simplified request.  Thank you

 Supercategories 

Hi Daniel

I just noticed on the Mariners article seems to have a couple of super-categories, Sport in NSW is a supercat of Football (soccer) in NSW, and Australian football (soccer) teams is a supercat of A-League teams.  It's a minor point but are the supercats necessary if you've already identified more specific cats?   
Ah, yes, you raise a very good point. I must say, categories have never been my strong point; the best example was Wikipedia:Featured list candidates/FIFA World Cup hat-tricks, when I submitted it to FLC without even adding them (I forgot about their existance totally). I have modified the article, as (from my limited category knowledge) you are quite correct. Cheers, and thanks so much for this note, all your other suggestions, and your minor fixes, '''' """,0.0

The climate can be illustrated by the welcome afforded my book in the non-Socialist press. This welcome was mainly silence, broken by the review in TLS headed 'Morris & Marxism''

So, yes the _1955_ edition was coolly received, in EPT's opinion largely because of his unfashionable Marxist viewpoint. But in '76, (when The Making of the English Working Class was in its 5th Penguin reprint), things had moved on...   11:44, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)",0.0

I agree with you that Mansfield probably wouldn't object to the label. He's willing to write a book about manliness, after all! ) But I don't think I'm being oversensitive. I've seen a concerted effort by numerous editors on the Wikipedia to stigmatize various Bush administration officials, and it often involves linking together Leo Strauss, neoconservatism, and the War in Iraq. At one time, I thought the Wikipedia guideline on biographies of living persons required that the subject of articles """"publicly identify with the belief in question"""" (at least I thought it did although I can't find the relevant passage now) and I assumed that's why the comment in the article said """"Mansfield has self identified as a Straussian.""""

There are so many conspiracy theories out there about Leo Strauss and the War in Iraq (see G-hits for the search terms [""""Leo Strauss"""" War Iraq]) that I tend to be vigilant with notable students of Leo Strauss, since the word """"Straussian"""" has been highjacked by critics and used pejoritively. Is there a reason you feel strongly about using the word """"Straussian""""?

The guideline says """"An organization is generally considered notable if it has been the subject of significant coverage in reliable, independent secondary sources."""" Essentially, the guideline is attempting to prevent handouts from an organization for being the indirect source of notability. The information that Florida Today used was obtained from the organization and from """"other"""" sources. This was not an attempt to publicize this organization which tries, like most agencies, to stay out of the media, not in it! It is not trying to sell anything. This is hardly WP:SPAM!.

There were two back-to-back reports on the agency which I have incorporated. There is an article about every month or so. It seemed time to have an article to put it into. In other words, it was notability and publicity that dictated the timing of the article, not the agency.   """,0.0

death to critics

So instead of  'every' earlier, now you are giving isolated cases, such as Theo van Gogh, Vincent van Gogh, Rashad Khalifa, and Irshad Manji who received death threats or were killed by anonymous unknown radicals.  What happened to every claim? Anyway, to prove your case that Islam sanctions death sentence to its critics, you can't just post the names of isolated cases where people received death threats from anonymous radicals! You need to post the names of prominent Islamic scholars and universities such as Al Azhar (not isolated radicals) who issued the death sentence against these people. The fatwa  against Rushdie was rejected by Al Azhar and all countries except Iran. So all you need to do is post Islamic sites (not anti-Islamic sites and isolated radical sites) who issued the death sentence against Menji, Rashad Khalifa, Theo van Gogh, etc. Bring your proof. Just throwing the names of isolated cases where someone received death threats from isolated anonymous radical doesn't prove Islam sanctions death sentence to it's critics! After 9/11, many Muslims and mosques received threats and some Muslims/Sikhs were even killed. That doesn't mean the US sanctions death to all American Muslims.  You are such a pathetic joke, dude!  Posting isolated cases where people received death threats from anonymous radicals doesn't prove a thing. We don't even know for sure who killed Rashad. You added even his name. You need to post the names of Muslim scholars who issues death sentence against, say, Rashad, Vincent van Gogg, and Menji. Then you need to post evidence that this was consensus among Muslim scholars on each of these cases.  Without that, you don't have any case, and you are refuted once again  09:33, 30 Nov 2004 (UTC)

I also provided examples of critics who were murdered by MUHAMMAD himself. Al-Azhar is not a higher authority than Muhammad.

No, you have only provided two stories in Ibn Ishaq about Muhammad that are rejected by Muslims, such as rejected here.  Al Azhar and Muslim scholars will interpret what Muhammad did and what Islamic law says, not an anti-Islamic bigot like you. You made a bold claim that in Islam critics are to be to be killed. I refuted that by giving examples that contradict that. You then claimed that every critic received a death sentence. You were refuted again. You then posted a list of isolated critics such as Rushdie, Menji, Rashad Khalifa, Theo van Gogh, etc, who received death threats from anonymous radicals. That's like posting (a much longer list) of Muslims/Sikhs who received death threats or were killed after 9/11, and claiming that American law allows Muslims to be killed. You were refuted again.  You need to provide names of prominent well known Muslim scholars (not anti-Islam sites or isolated radicals) for each of these cases and prove that they issued the death sentence. After that, you need to provide proof that that judgement was a consensus among Muslims scholars. You didn't do that. You were refuted once again. Since you are an anti-Islamic bigot, you can't just claim that Muhammad did this or that or Islamic law says this or that and expect that claim to be inserted in Encyclopedia. You need to provide proof. You couldn't because you were wrong. Try again, dude. You have failed quite miserably here  03:40, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)

Furthermore, whe opinons of secular governments are irrelevant - of course Musilm countries rejected the death fatwa against Rushdie, but this was due to international politics, not due to religion. Also, as stated before, Ayatollah Khomenie was a Shiah CLERIC. The only way to be an Ayatollah is to be born as one. Aside from being the dictator or IRan, Khomenie was also the spiritial and religious leader of huge numbers of Sha'ias around the world. Khomenie wrote many fatwas and books about Islam. His most famous fatwa, of course, calls for the murder of Salman Rushdie. Now Al-Azhar - a SUNNI university  SUPPOSEDLY rejected KHomenei's teachings. This does not mean by any means prove that Al-Azhar was right, and Khomenie was wrong. The fact that KHomenie was a shiah cleric, while Al-Azhar is a sunni university is also a  gaping hole in this argument. You have no ev",0.0

It might be confused at first, but later people will distingush and get use to it. I took the idea from List of countries by date of transition to republican system of government. We don't have to mention too much about the 20th century. Like other periods, the 20th century is just a small portion of the whole national history. I want make all periods to be balanced. Look at same examples such as Template:History of Austria, Template:History of India, I have to say they mention WAY TOO MUCH about the 20th century. While we only need to mention main periods. I definitely want to the template to be shortened and less emphasis put on post-19th century stuff.   """,0.0

"""== Discussing recombination ==

Recently I noticed that this article uses 'genetic recombination' to refer to recombination that occurs during in meiosis and brings about genetic diversity among organisms.  This isn't necessarily correct: genetic recombination can also refer to non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or V(D)J recombination, neither of which, to my knowledge, occur during meiosis or produce heritable genetic diversity among organisms.  To account for that, I think it would be helpful to replace instances of 'genetic recombination' with 'homologous recombination', the type of genetic recombination to which this article refers.  What are others' thoughts on this?  The only drawback I could see would be the slightly less reader-friendly word 'homologous'. This, however, seems clarified by the first sentence in the 'Sex and recombination' section to invoke the phrase: """"In the related process of genetic recombination, sexual organisms can also exchange DNA between two matching chromosomes.""""  If the inaccessibility of the word 'homologous' were in fact a drawback, I think it would be more than compensated for by the greater accuracy of the information being presented to the reader.

Yesterday I tried introducing this change, but was reverted.  In the summary of that reversion, the editor noted: """"why be less general? homologous excludes translocations, duplications, fusions, etc.""""  I've offered my rationale for being specific just above, but was curious about the second sentence.  If homologous recombination excludes translocations, duplications, fusions, etc., then is that somehow accounted for by other types of genetic recombination, like NHEJ or V(D)J recombanation?  To my understanding, it is a failure of homologous recombination in meiosis that produces heritable chromosome translocations, fusions, and gene duplications.    

I think you are correct, being more accurate is better since the sentence does refer specifically to matching chromosomes. I've reworded this to state In a related process called homologous recombination, sexual organisms exchange DNA between two matching chromosomes. I've added the idea of general recombination to the previous section, adding Mutations can involve large sections of DNA becoming duplicated, usually through genetic recombination.   

 Charles Darwin film 'too controversial for religious America' 

""""A British film about Charles Darwin has failed to find a US distributor because his theory of evolution is too controversial for American audiences, according to its producer.""""    

That's a laugh. Please don't try to make evolution look like it's a helpless victim being attacked by a bunch of religious nuts. The theory of evolution does have many loopholes, but America is not religious by any means; I'm shocked that an American producer turned down the film. —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs) 

Sorry, I just don't see how evolution can be a controversial topic - evolution is all around us, simple as that. People who tend to object to such basic fundamental facts of life tends not to understand the depth of the topic to the point of understanding it, but rather the shallow aspect to justify their lack of understanding. Not everyone is good at science so some people would tend to take the shallow route of critizing something if they don't understand. Example; I'm terrible at pre-calculus so I critize the aspect of pre-calculus to justify my understanding - see where I'm getting at?

Not relevant here. The Evolution article is not about Charles Darwin, the film is not about evolution, and there is an entirely separate page for the creation–evolution controversy. Please don't post sociological trivia on the Talk page of a biology article. (Also, evolutionary theory does not have """"loopholes."""") -  """,0.0

 Any chance of a return to Good Article status? 

Talk:Harley-Davidson/GA1

When this review was done, the reasons for stripping this article of its """"Good Article"""" status were as follows:
Prose quality: Too many orphan sentences and single sentence paragraphs.
MoS compliance: Introduction is too short, see WP:LEAD for more info. Introduction should be a summary of the entire article, and generally should not contain information which is not contained within the body. One of the images contains a watermark for a website. 
Citation of reliable sources where necessary: Large areas of uncited information. Orphan sentences only complicate the issue of finding what comes from which source. Article is littered with tags and rough edits.
 No original research: Uncited information may contain original research.

Since that time, the introduction has been expanded, the offending watermark has been cropped out of the image (which had been donated under the appropriate licence by the site in question), and citations have been added, though maybe not enough.

The peer reviewer tool came up with the following concerns:
Consider adding more links to the article; per Wikipedia:Manual of Style (links) and Wikipedia:Build the web, create links to relevant articles.
Per Wikipedia:What is a featured article?, Images should have concise captions.
Per Wikipedia:Manual of Style (numbers), there should be a non-breaking space -   between a number and the unit of measurement. For example, instead of 45 cubic inch, use 45 cubic inch, which when you are editing the page, should look like: 45 cubic inch.
Per Wikipedia:Manual of Style (headings), headings generally do not start with articles ('the', 'a(n)'). For example, if there was a section called ==The Biography==, it should be changed to ==Biography==.
Per Wikipedia:Manual of Style (headings), headings generally should not repeat the title of the article. For example, if the article was Ferdinand Magellan, instead of using the heading ==Magellan's journey==, use ==Journey==.
Per Wikipedia:Manual of Style (headings), avoid using special characters (ex: &+{}[]) in headings.
Per WP:WIAFA, this article's table of contents (ToC) may be too long – consider shrinking it down by merging short sections or using a proper system of daughter pages as per Wikipedia:Summary style.
#The script has spotted the following contractions: Didn't, if these are outside of quotations, they should be expanded. (A search of the article found the use of """"didn't"""" in a quote of a reference.)

We should also keep an eye on WP:SIZERULE, which indicates that we should probably split this article.  Granted, the 91 kB size is a gross figure and the readable prose would be somewhat less, but splitting off and summarizing the History and Engines sections might be advisable.  

The Model Designations section could also use some work.

O.K., folks, are we up to it?

If you tally up the total UDA/UVF/LVF killed in the book lost lives (from 1968-1998) it shows 90 Loyalists killed by the IRA and INLA during that time period. The book """"The Irish War"""" also gives the number of 90, on the page I quoted, as does the Jane's intelligence report. That is THREE sources to the one source you quote. I am sick of having my hard work hacked up by some half-assed administrator who can't deal with the fact that his IRA article was full of innacuracies. I have contacted a friend of mine who is a senior administrator, you should be recieving an E-mail from him shortly. Unless you want your administrator privilages revoked, I suggest you either stop re-editing my article, or merge my facts with your own. I am pissed that I took the time to re-submit the article in the way you asked, and you are still throwing a hissy fit. You are one of the worst administrator's I have ever dealt with, you are the reason academics don't respect Wikipedia. 

PS. I realize you are a Loyalist terrorist supporter, and therefore can't deal with the fact that the IRA killed a large number of UDA/UVF/LVF members...but those are the historical facts, grow up and deal with it.

 Need help for Armenia page 

I need an important favor, can you please put this version  for what was changed in the infobox """"Formation and Independance"""". Since I noticed it more properly matches the present day Armenia article. Thank you. They removed the older version that was thet for over 3 years with traditional 2492 in the formation and indepedance infobox. Also, the head paragraph which is trying to explain false history lessons in the Armenia article. This older edit i provided here is much better for the Armenia article, instead of these different versions of the ancient history on the top of the Armenia article.

 Sound of jewellery 

The sound of jewellery has played an enermous part in many stories, poems, and religious literature (more details and sources to come).
Different jewellery creates different sounds, ie plastic bangles create a high pitched clink sound, while others such as baxelite produce
a """"clunck"""" sound. Knowing how a particular piece of jewellery sounds can help someone identify whether or not a piece of jewellery is fake.
Indeed people have written about the sound of """"fake gold"""", and jewel makers such as Sharon Alouf, a famous jeweler have praised the high frequency pitched noise of gold bangles(most likely real gold she is wearing). To this day, the jeweler claims, """"the sound of bangles clinking together is very soothing to me. It always reminds me of motherhood.""""Alouf is even partial to particular tones. """"Gold produces my favorite sound,"""" she says, """"the pitch is higher and clearer, which I find energizing."""" """,0.0

""":In an interpreted language your source code is read in command by command by a software tool, which is called the Interpreter and executed.

What ? Command-by-command ? No interpreter is using such crappy technique nowadays. Taw

 From Interpreted Language/Talk 
 
some languages (like Perl) are compiled at runtime

Could you elaborate ? Taw

Every time a perl script is run, Perl compiles it and then runs the compiled code. At least, this is the usual way of using perl, although it's not the only way. Zundark, 2001 Dec 15

You mean compile to syntactic tree or compile to machine code ? Taw

 I believe it's compiled to bytecode, much like Java. As of perl 5.6 (version?), it's possible to produce a bytecode version of a perl program to save the compilation step. I think the bytecode can be converted back to full source as well, but I'm not as sure about that. Indigo Perl (http://www.indigoperl.com) produces a perl compiler that produces a machine executable, but I think the resulting executable consists of both the actual bytecode and enough of the perl engine to run the bytecode, so they tend to be rather large. Their advantage is being able to deploy the code to machines that don't necessarily have the Perl interpreter installed.  They have versions for both Windows and Unix-ish platforms.  Wesley

 Old Interpreted Language article 

An interpreted language is a type of programming language that is not compiled into machine code, but is interpreted at run-time by the computer, and translated into machine understandable code as required.

It is often a mistake to refer to a language as either """"interpreted"""" or """"compiled"""", because
most languages can be implemented in either way, and some languages
(like Perl) are compiled at
runtime but behave as if they were interpreted.
Other languages, like Java, may be partially compiled into an
intermediate form which is then interpreted (although that, too, might be compiled).
Some languages, though, are specifically designed to favor interpretation.

An example of an interpreted language is JavaScript.

Is Java interpreted, or what? 

The Java programming language article says:

""""The first implementations of the language used an interpreted virtual machine to achieve portability, and many implementations still do. These implementations produce programs that run more slowly than the fully-compiled programs created by the typical C++ compiler and some later Java language compilers, so the language suffered a reputation for producing slow programs. More recent implementations of the Java VM produce programs that run much faster, using multiple techniques.""""

The Java language is compiled, always.  It is designed as a compiled language, and is implemented as a compiled language.  It is often compiled into bytecode, which is then interpreted (with a virtual machine).  I think the Java language article is correct, but maybe it could be worded better.  LDC

Yes, and you can also compile Jave straight down to machine code if you like. The above claim that it is a mistake to differentiate between interpreted and compiled languages is IMHO incorrect; every language that has an """"eval"""" statement which lets you construct and evaluate statements on the fly can never be cleanly compiled down to machine code; you will always have to embed an interpreter in your compiled code. AxelBoldt

Way too much mess here has been caused by lack of clear definition of """"compiling"""".
It is used in two distinct meanings, as in:
 compiled to machine code (or assembly)
 compiled to byte code/parse tree/some other internal representation

I think it's wrong to call languages that use the second way """"compiled"""". In such case there would be virtually no interpreted language in use - no language uses line-by-line parsing nowadays, all """"compile"""" source to some form of internal representation.

Quote from FOLDOC:
     Compiler

     A program that converts another program
     from some {source language} (or {programming language}) to
     {machine language} (object code).  Some compilers output
     {assembly language} which is then converted to {machine
     language} by a separate {assembler}.

Article needs review by nuclear physicist(s)
Just skimming the introduction I found three rather significant factual errors which I corrected.  I review those here.

The first point was that the article insisted that fusion occurs between like-charged atomic nuclei, but this limitation is not true.  For example, a nuclear reaction of 12C+16O can proceed through the fusion channel, yet their atomic charge differs.  There are literally hundreds of such cases, and citation would be gregarious and seems unnecessary (but I can link a few articles if anyone disputes this point).

The article suggested that two protons can fuse, and even suggested that such a reaction is governed by the nuclear strong force.  Not true.  p+p->d is a weak interaction, because you must convert a proton into a neutron.  Weak interactions are not fusion.

This error leads to a more general point.  Simply putting nuclei together to make something heavier does not constitute fusion.  A common misconception is that nuclear fusion refers to any coalescence of nuclei, but in nuclear physics, fusion is a specific reaction mechanism.  I will need to confirm, but I believe that, for example, the reactions in the CNO cycles proceed mainly through radiative capture, which isn't fusion.  I can find comments in the introduction instructing me not to correct the """"general"""" statement about nucleosynthesis, but the point is that this is generalized so much that it is incorrect.  I can even find comments there saying not to link to the s-process, but the s-process does not involve fusion reactions as far as I know.  There are actually a rather limited number of stellar nucleosynthesis cases that actually proceed through the fusion mechanism, such as carbon burning and oxygen burning.  These are literally the only two examples I can think of off hand that I'm sure proceed via fusion.  All the rest I'm fairly dubious about at the moment, although some of the pp-chain reactions may also be fusion.

Thus, we in fact need likely a whole section explaining the nuclear physics of fusion and what it is and what it is not.

Finally, I noticed that the article suggested humans have never controlled fusion.  This is naff.  There are plenty of nuclear physics experiments which have not only controlled fusion, but made very careful measurements of the properties of the fusion mechanism at many energy scales.  Clearly, the writer wanted to imply that fusion as a source of stable source of energy has never been achieved by humans, so this was changed to reflect that point.

But given that I could find a serious physics error in every paragraph I read so far, clearly this article needs some serious attention Please do not revert my corrections without discussing the matter here or explicit citation indicating that I am incorrect.    """,0.0

Alex, thank you for your reply.
I could indeed use a break from this case, but yesterday was a very eventful day, as the case closed and then AGK answered a question I'd initially posed on August 22, meaning that he refused to engage regarding the false allegation he made against during the brief window during which I had a chance to respond to the FoF, and then when it made the response, it not only confirmed the """"judgment on content"""" aspect of the FoF, if begs the question as to why he cited another diff including an exchange with Arzel in which Arzel not only ignores the content of academically published RS, he openly denigrates them in a thread where blocks of text of the Formisano text, for example, had been under direct discussion.

Regarding the perceived legal threat, I had no intention to make a legal threat. That was all sort of sarcastic play on words relating to specific sequence of events in the case, starting with NewYorkBrad's comment on my FoF on August 23, to which AGK refused to reply publicly until the case had been closed yesterday, more than two weeks later. There were also email exchanges between myself and NYB and AGK, which I will have to forward to Jimbo Wales at some point, after clarifying one point made by NYB on his talk page.

The import of the substance is firstly a pun insofar as I make an insinuation about sophistry in the legal field in relation to my perception that AGK aspires to become an attorney (or whatever they're called in Scotland). It is secondly an indication that I have taken the time to register at Wikipediocracy for future reference regarding earlier comments I had made about """"the court of public opinion"""". And when did a little looking around there, finding an entry about NYB, for example, who had advised AGK that he didn't see any misconduct in some of the points of the FoF, so it was thirdly an indirect suggestion that he learn something from someone that is already an accomplished attorney. 

If the reiteration of material deleted by AGK from his User page within the past two weeks is """"outing"""", then that is a policy I shall have to examine. Note that I am not the only editor to have broached the issue of his being an undergraduate in the context of his judgment and actions acting in the capacity of arbitrator in the case at issue.

There's much more to say on this, but I need to get a couple more hours of sleep. I have tried to leave links to relevant discussions at Jimbo's talk page, but have only provided a partial synthesis of the situation, not even contrasting the complete lack of an FoF on Arzel, for instance, with the response provided to me on the PD talk page shortly after the case was officially closed yesterday.

If this statement settles some of the concerns regarding my intentions, and the severity of the infractions thereby diminished, I would appreciate a reduction of the length of the block to facilitate my engaging in the necessary efforts to conduct the appeal without having to exclusively rely on the email system.  連絡 見学/迷惑 """,0.0

I just wanted to say that professional doctors in Brazil often use it along traditional Western health care (generally after, prescribing together with allopathic treatment, NEVER as medicine). There is an idea here of people of using it in the same way a vaccine could do good i.e. that thing I mentioned earlier with my experience, a really great quantity (in terms of homoeopathy, that is nearly nothing – that former doctor of mine explained the most common homoeopathy to my mother using the joke of the comparison to seawater) of dead ill-bearing beings together with herbal medicine. But I think no sane person would qualify it as cure anywhere, even in the limited demographics that homoeopathy, to say, can improve 5-20% of their immune system functioning (but all immune systems are different because every human is a universe, perhaps in most people something so light that is reason of mockery such as hpthy is likely worthless). Alternative medicine approach is not something to trust (much less alone) in case of death-threatening diseases – in the immune system example, homoeopathy would be used in light to mid allergies such as the source of my rhinitis, with a grain of salt in more serious conditions (together with traditional treatment – like what cured me from chronic sinusitis and otitis, and I attribute it more to the non-homoeopathic treatment), but I don't expect an effect at all with auto-immune conditions. If someone offers it as medicine, it is obviously quackery, but I think that the point of Mkweise is not how homoeopathy can kill by the ignorance of some users and/or shamelessness of quackers, but how it is said to not work in every situation, with nobody, and all scientific research adequately using methods of demonstrating it, what millions of people that are not necessarily ignorant (including 3 former doctors that saved my life that hadn't no profit with the so-called quackery) would disagree to. BUT I don't have sources to reivindicate my claims unlike the other side, so I will neither change content nor ask someone to do it.   22:10",0.0

Just paste “Premier's Climate Change Council’ into the search box on the home page.  Secondly, with respect to the “Membership” section, content explaining from what sectors of the community the members are sourced from should be added.  Also, the “dot point” lists should be converted into a paragraph of names in alphabetical order with the words “(chair)” after the person who currently has this responsibility.  I suggest this for two reasons - firstly, the ‘lists’ do dominate the article and secondly, as the article does not appear to be intended to be a list as per WP guidance.

 Role in Russian civil war 

That section states the Bolsheviks won that war in the late 1919. That is completely wrong by any historic books and textbooks. Officially the war ended in 1922, but there was still fighting going on in the Russian Far East. That is what the Soviet historical textbooks say. For some reason the war with the Ukraine is being perceived as the Civil war in Soviet times and it seems that the same trend exist today as well. That is also wrong. Ukraine was a recognized state by the Soviet Russia as well as by the other numerous countries. That was a straight aggresion against the Ukrainian republic, following an unbelievable slaughtering of population in Ukraine by bolsheviks (Kyiv and Podillia still remembered). In 1920 Ukraine united with Poland to stop the bolshevik bandits. The Soviet textbooks state that it was an intervention of the """"White"""" Polish burgouis, relating it to the Russian white movement which is way off. 

Not on the subject of the section, but Stalin should be recognized as the enemy of the world and, at least, should be on the same page with Adolf Hitler. Stalin was way more evil. Not all of his wrongdoings are uncovered, but the one that already are known can easily convict the guy. His name should be cursed for the eternity and humanity needs to learn to avoid the next Stalin.   

Define """"convict."""" What exactly is Stalin guilty of? Killing off men and women that he believed threatened the unity and safety of his nation? Knights did that all the time. Under Stalin, the Soviet Union became incredibly well-developed, albeit uncaring towards others. They even beat us in the space race. I'm sure all of our wonderful presidents would have thought that would happen with the amazing ideals of wonderful democracy. Luna RainHowLCry

"""== Early Chicago computer club ==
Hi, thanks for all your efforts!!!

Not sure if you wanted me to answer via your talk page. 

AFAICR (made that up - As Far As I Can Remember) the Chicago computer club I was involved with was C.A.C.H.E., the Chicago Area Computer Hobbyists Exchange. 

I believe there was a meeting approx Apr '75, begun by Robert Swartz, who was lucky enough to be able to affort a """"Digital Systems"""" original 8080 """"box"""" - and the CP/M operating system.  

(Digital Systems was right up the road from Gary Kildall (the CP/M guy)so they got together.  - One making a rugged box and the other the OS for it). 

The """"hobby"""" as I see it really took off with the MITS Altair on the cover of the January, 1975 issue of Popular Electronics. 

[Back to Chicago Club] SO one day reading Pop'tronics, I noticed a piece saying there had been a computer club in the Chicago area, naming the people who attended, and saying when the next one was.    As I recall it was Lloyd Smith (now my best friend) formerly of Dyer IN, and Bill Burther, Valparaiso IN (R.I.P.).  

SO we rode together to that possibly 2nd, or perhaps 3rd meeting (? Sept 1975) and I was hooked. 

MY involvement with the club was to be an """"active participant"""" in that for ex. I was sec'y for many years, wrote programs to maintain the mailing list, help with the newsletter, often whipping up a small newsletter myself when no one else helped (this was one of the events that led to the invention of the BBS).  I brought my system in to show, back when maybe one in 10 actually HAD a system. 

My home system consisted of an Altair 8080, to which I had added a Selectric Typewriter and Dynastor FLYING HEAD disk drive (a whopping 256K, yes, KAY).   I had to (1) teach myself digital electronics; and (2) design and create the board to interface to these uniquely-mine peripherals (Ex: Type a char on the selectric (terminal) and watch what came in - on an oscilloscope) THEN program the altair to """"produce outputs that matched that timing"""", learning that  gasp IBM put the parity bit at the opposite end of the word than most of the rest of the world!)

My machine also  once """"video"""" became available (I skipped the """"TV Typewriter"""" phase), a 16 x 64 display called a Processor Technology Video Display Module.  (and no coincidence, the BBS Randy Suess and I invented and I programmed, had a 16 x 64 size message limit at first). 

THEN my world opened to assembler programming (not hand assembling or some other hack) when Processor Technology came out with a paper tape-distributed editor and 8080 assembler.  (I seem to recall it having 4 things, but don't recall now.)

I modified the PT Asm to run on cassette tapes (The """"Tarbell"""" having become a standard) and called the combination of things the """"CACHE Cassette Operating System"""" (CCOS) and several people in the club started writing assembler programs.  

SO anyway, the club had a huge variety of machines represented - from the """"boards"""" - Kim-1, ?? Trying to remember if the Apple-1 was a """"board"""" - I think so and the little Sinclair """"pocket calculator"""" sized ones from TI or with a TI chip.  

When the Radio Shack computers came along, many of us pioneers thought """"this is the end of the hobby"""".  What we meant was, for example (maybe an extreme example) - I could design and make my own boards, AND write the BIOS routines to run them, etc, and THAT was more the fun - so someone buying a """"built"""" machine seemed kind of sad.  However, this is the march of time, and I'm sure the """"Hams"""" (amateur radio enthusiasts) felt a bit the same way as more and more products came along making it easier and easier to """"talk over the air""""..   I eventually - and somewhat delinquently - adopted the PC, but by then had pretty much """"burned out"""" programming as a hobby, and did not make a LOT of contributions in that area. 

____ END _____ of my thoughts on the club, is this what you were looking for?  

Just to """"come to a better close""""  the fact I'd done my own HW meant incompatability, so I invented MODEM.ASM (named  and it stuck  Xmodem by Keith Peterson) to be able to """"beep"""" things back and forth with friends; 

Then the BBS came about as ME thinking a dial-in system to gather articles for a newsletter, but Randy Suess suggested a club project would be """"by committee"""" so just the two of us - him HW and me SW - did it, independently of the club.  — Preceding unsignedcomment added by  (talk • contribs)

""":Instead of asking me personal questions about what I believe, the same question can be put to you in reverse:  Do you seek to exclude these ancient accounts of Miracles of Jesus based on your personal belief that certain ancient accounts are """"valid"""" sources, and others are not?  Do you claim to know which sources people are allowed to read about in the article, based on which ones are considered """"canonical""""?  Does it really matter who """"historians deem"""" any of sources - whether the ones you personally approve of being mentioned, or the ones you don't - to have genuinely been written by?  They are all definitely ancient sources, and they were all definitely written by somebody - whether it was the person they were ascribed to, or someone else.  The only possible basis you have for mentioning some and not mentioning others, would be based on certain of them having been declared """"frauds that must bve suppressed"""" by various councils of Bishops.  Wikipedia is not bound to avoid mentioning them at all, just because some council of Bishops wants them to be suppressed.  Bringing up what historians say is a red herring, because as you well know, plenty of historians can be found who say they are ALL frauds, hence there is nothing alongside historians to differentiate one set from the other set.  The only differentiation comes from your personal beliefs, or from the declaration of some council.  And please note, we are just mentioning them in the article as existing  not stating which ones are """"true"""" or """"untrue"""".  We've clearly stated that they aren't part of the canon. It's wrong to pretend they don't exist, and to suppress all mention of them, based on which ones you, bishops, or even historians personally might feel are """"untrue"""".  They are noteworthy simply because they are ancient.   (ውይይት)

"Criticism 

> The Oohashi et al. (2006) results reveal some interesting contradictions. While full bandwidth sound was preferred to CD limited bandwidth (over a speaker), the test for the ultrasonic music band was inaudible when reproduced alone. Additionally, the preference for HFC was not replicated when using headphones, only with speaker presentation, ruling out the ear as the means by which the effect was produced. 



These are not contradictions. They are an essential feature of the study, specified and discussed in the paper. There is no contradiction here. Out it goes.(  )

 Contrary evidence and ABX tests 

Oohashi et al. pictured human brains when the test persons were either exposed or not exposed to ultrasonic stimulus. ABX tests only tell, what differences test persons consciously perceive or not during the test. If same research methods had been used and results were drastically different, that should be called contradictory.   
I will state that even more generally than previous: There are certainly many signals and irritants that human beings can be unconsciously exposed to, but nevertheless they affect human's well-being and happiness. For example several chemicals or radioactivity would do that. We just don't know the whole truth about ultrasonic signals yet. Some signals could be processed half consciously in human's brains: One feels restless or nervous but still does not know why.",0.0

"""

 The """"Ethiopian birr model"""" 

You suggested to use this model in some cases. In my opinion, it is okay to include a territory in the current part succession box that has some autonomous rights (especially the right to have its own currency, like pre-2006 Montenegro or present-day Kosovo). Therefore, in the case of Ethiopian birr, it makes sense to speak about currency of Eritrea between 1952-1960 and between 1993-1997. between 1960-1993, only Ethiopian administration existed, Eritrea had neither sovereignty nor any sort of autonomous rights. (Saying in 1978 that the currency of Eritrea is the birr is like saying in 2006 that the currency of East Germany is the euro.) The same case of Austria between 1938-1945. Even Ukraine and Belarus represents the same situation during their Soviet Union """"membership"""", however, both countries had more or less autonomy and were members of the UN since 1945. 

I have the fear that the innumerable border modifications in Europe during the XXth century will make huge and complicated succession boxes. For example, after WWII, Slovakia got back not only its Southern territories (Which the 1st Vienna Award awarded to Hungary in 1938), but three villages near to Pozsony / Bratislava (Horvátjárfalu / Jarovce, Oroszvár / Rusovce, Dunacsúny / Cunovo) were awarded to Slovakia (Treaty of Paris) due to strategic considerations. One could say that who cares with three villages, but this territory was part of Hungary between the two world wars - and it is not much smaller than Muraköz (Medimurje)...

So I don't think each territorial change must be mentioned in the succession box. Only mention if the currency of a new country / state / autonomous province etc. (so a state-like subject that has the right to circulate its own currency) appears without precedessor (like Eritrean nakfa after split from Ethiopia in 1993, but unlike Ethiopian birr after split of Eritrea) or disappears without successor (like East German mark after the reunificaton of Germany in 1990, but unlike West-German mark after the reunification).

For example, German mark or deutschmark was the currency of the Federal Republic of Germany between 1948-2001. It would express that East Germany was simply integrated into West-Germany (contrary to the widely used """"reunification"""" term), at least from the point of view of the circulating currency. It would also express that Germany is not the successor state of West Germany but the same country with an enlarged territory. 

In the case of the pengő, I would simply say that it was the currency of Hungary between 1 Jan 1927 and 31 Jul 1946. Northern Transylvania, Southern Slovakia and Bácska was totally incorporated into the Hungarian administration. Subcarpathia enjoyed some autonomy, but it was very little and cannot be compared to the rights of then-Yugoslav federal states, present day US states or German federal states.

"You are talking nonsense again. The reconstructed pronunciation is not a modern theory nor has it been substantiated by modern linguists. Repeating the same old 19th century out of date fallacies in a modern book does not constitute evidence or substantiation. The only differnece between modern linguists repitition of these fallacies and the original is that the modern linguists have removed all of the racist slurs from the original work (well most of them anyway) and have included the disclaimer that none of the nonsense they are regurgitating is provable given the historical evidence, or rather the complete lack of it, and modern research which is unanimously against the theory. Thanos Papadimitrakopulos publication is a perfectly valid source since it postdates the standard form of the reconstructed pronunciation that is still taught today (a theory that is never substantiated to students but is taught as unproven dogma) and he has never been refuted. Chrys C. Caragounis is a linguistics expert and a philologist and is thus a valid source. Development of Greek and the New Testament, Mohr Siebeck (ISBN 3161482905) is his most recent publication a probable the most recent research on ancient Greek pronunciation in existence. Anyone claiming to be an expert in ancient Greek that still believes in the reconstructed pronunciation has no right to be called an expert since it is like believing in the Ptolemaic Earth centred universe which observations have shown to be wrong. All of the experts in Semitic linguistics are against the reconstructed pronunciation of ancient Greek since they make it perfectly clear that ancient Greek was pronounced like modern Greek at the time the Septuagint was translated from the original Hebrew in 280 BC. This therefore implies that classical Greek must have been pronounced like modern Greek as well otherwise 72 Hebrew expert who were taught ancient Greek as children 50 years earlier would not have associated the proto-Semitic fricative gimel in Gomorra which was no longer used in the written language but was only spoken as a breath with the Greek letter gamma. Gamma therefore must have been fricative and there a myriads of other examples that Semitic linguists use to show that ancient Greek was pronounced like modern Greek and that the Hebrew alphabet represented the mediae and dasea and z as fricatives. It is clear from the study of Semitic linguistics and from experts in the filed like Caragounis and Papadimitrakopulos that the reconstructed pronunciation is a racist sham based on Germanic supremacy (as can be seen from the slurs in the papers of is original creators) and an affront to science and the only reason why it is still being tangut is for ethnocentric reasons alone.",0.14285714285714285

Simply put, the link fails based on several conditions under """"Links normally to be avoided"""":
1. Any site that does not provide a unique resource beyond what the article would contain if it became a Featured article. (The site in question contains very little information, none of which is unique.)
3. Links mainly intended to promote a website. (Given the lack of unique information present, this link serves no purpose other than to gain a larger audience for the site.)
5. Links to sites with objectionable amounts of advertising. (Site has prominent text advertising in column on right side of page, visible at all times.)
As well, an examination of the site (home page etc.) reveals that it appears to exist primarily to get viewers for advertising.

The Cabal blocks people illegally, so the public is forced to employ other tactics to avoid the Cabal's finagling fingers.  Fortunately, the identities of the Cabal are now (at least, in part) being exposed.  Skomorokh, strangely, is holding back, perhaps fearful of losing control over his high-priority 'assignment'.  Actually, if Skomorokh were honest and ethical, he would by now either have weighed in on the subject, or he would have explicitly dissociated himself from the dispute.  (Rather than merely remaining silent.) And since most of the incorrect 'misinformation' on 'jim bell' originated from Skomorokh's edits, he should be willing to step aside and allow his errors to be corrected.      71.36.117.224  """,0.0

Fair use rationale for Image:AlexKiddManga.png

Thanks for uploading or contributing to Image:AlexKiddManga.png. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Suggestions on how to do so can be found  here.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to insure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page. 

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the """"my contributions"""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"Image"""" from the dropdown box.

 The various local government areas pages only list them.  I was thinking something like that.  These three paragraphs are from a couple of papers I wrote, they can be incorporated into the article.  

The states (and territories) run the majority of the government in Australia and devolve some of this power down to local government, local councils.  Because this devolution of power happens on a state by state basis, in different states, the local councils have different powers.  Though generally they provide water, sewerage and look after local roads, with the states looking after health, education, police and so on.

Tasmania, like the other states, has a constitution.  Unlike the Australian constitution the Tasmanian one is simply an act of parliament, as such to change it requires no more then a majority in the parliament, not a referendum.  This constitution (among other things) establishes local government in Part """"IVA - Local Government"""" (Tasmanian Constitution).  However, this part while establishing the fact that councils will exist, leaves open how they are operated and what their powers are.  Both the system and power of the councils being provided by the """"Parliament ... from time to time"""" (Tasmanian Constitution).  It is the """"Local Government Act 1993"""" (referred hereafter to as either the 'LGA' or 'the act') that currently provides for the creation of the various councils, the role of the councillors, what power the councils have and so on.  

The act requires that the various councils """"provide for the health, safety and welfare of the community"""", """"represent and promote the interests of the community"""", and """"provide for the peace, order and good government of the municipal area"""".  Generally the act permits councils to """"do anything necessary or convenient to perform its functions either within or outside its municipal area"""".  Specifically, the act provides for the various councils to have the following powers (among others): to charge land rates, """"service rates"""", special rates and to levy fines (in relation to by-laws); and, to make by-laws in respect to anything the council has power to do.
 I'm sure the other states have similar legislation.   (Fuck you!) """,0.14285714285714285

"Article needs to be split into two

There are two different things going on in this article: one is a hypothetical discussion of what a North American currency union might look like, based on descriptions in obscure white papers from think tanks and science fiction books. The other is the origin and debunking of the conspiracy theory that such a union actually is being planned by some sort of powerful forces. The two have little to do with each other, for one. Additionally, by keeping the two in one article, the citations for the first look like evidence for the latterwhich they are not, and which some of the people who provide them probably do not want them used as. The first article should be the place for discussing serious economic and futurologist viewpoints about what an NACU might be; the second should be devoted largely to a sociological analysis of why people believe in the conspiracy theorynot to details of the theory itself, as that lends undue weight to the idea that said theory is true. I suggest that the two articles be: North American currency union (concept in literature) and North American currency union (conspiracy theory).",0.0

The problem, precisely, is that if you assume that there is an underlying structure [noun] is raining [object], then from the very start you deny the possibility that the pronoun before the verb is in fact meaningless, i. e. a dummy word. If the pronoun refers to a noun and you can say what this noun is, then by definition it's not a dummy pronoun. My contention is that (maybe) the verb is really impersonal, i. e. its subject is truly a dummy word, not meant to mean anything but only appearing there to fill a syntactic slot.

The definition given at the start of the article is not sourced appropriately, I know; it just covers what I think are the features of what linguists call """"dummy pronoun"""", based on my amateur experience on the matter. I know it's not completely wrong or misleading, though it probably needs a different form. The glossary definition above, OTOH, is a bit too vague, but in any case, note that the very first example of dummy word given below in the source is the it in It is raining.""",0.0

Actually, I know a great number of scientists will tell you it is not science at all, but rather religion or superstition. Pseudoscience covers some things, but this isn't really even pseudoscience but an attempt to pretend there is some scientific basis for creationism.

I went to the first link on Bellamy. And its about him being persecuted by lunatics. So you wouldn't wonder that he would be intimidated into a retraction. So its full spectrum lunacy here. Trying to control the Wiki. Intimidating scientists who disagree with you. A major cult movement. Which is not to say that his comments on glaciers weren't way out of date and wrong. If indeed he did make them. What happens is that these leftists will follow people around taking notes of every last thing they say. And then if they make one mistake then that's a hanging offence.

Counter-Arguments to Criticism

It is important to note, most of these arguments employ one or more logical fallacies. They are often made implying certain claims such as some mystical and unchanging human nature. Other times they are so conservative that they threaten denying what is already possible today, such as organ replacement and robots performing many tasks in an adaptive manner. Some of these arguments use appeals to emotion, not limited to the claim that since there is an inequality between the rich and poor that we should slow down progress. Appeals to emotion such as this deny the fact that transhumanism will alleviate such problems instead of exacerbating them such as making the acquisition of food and knowledge more accessible.

But you know what the funniest part of all this is? I WIN. I literally have about 17 other accounts that have absolutely nothing to do with """"Vost"""", """"ElliotJoyce"""", or """"Accreditor"""", and I've used those accounts to transform Wikipedia articles to match my tastes, which usually means countering the racist garbage from pseudo-intellectual cancers like you sweety. See, from all of the edits I do, you dumb idiots pick up only a fraction to revert- while I've been keeping you busy with Vost socks (which itself is a sock of another account), I've committed over 200 edits under the radar from special-proxy rotations in the last 4 days. I have 2 admin accounts, 5 non-admin accounts of previously active users which I've since been able to commandeer (more on this later), and about 10 standard self-created accounts. What's even more hilarious is that the reverts engendered by my socks usually cause enough notice to the article that I don't even have to do anything to get my views to dominate: I let other users add fuel to the fire that I started. But you know what the absolute kicker to all of this is? I got you, yes you, you Jew-wannabe, black racist cancer smear, to violate numerous Wikipedia policies and your own Wikipedia philosophy by going after me, vendetta style.

I win, and considering that your power level on Wikipedia is considerably more entrenched than my own, my victory is that much more devastating. The IP I'm using at the moment, courtesy of the 24-hour computer lab in my dorm, is about 1 of thousands of batch IPs I have access to, which gives me even greater security and privilege to spread myself over Wikipedia in case my special proxy rotation is ever categorized as a proxy, and thus blocked. Oh, and regarding the commandeering of accounts: graphical analysis password bypass and deconstruction (GAPBAD) is a rather effective means to obliterate CAPTCHA; its use is only feasible at specific time intervals when security measures on the target fluctuate or do not register properly. Guess which account is getting targeted next as soon as Wikipedia undergoes its next server hash? ). You've been warned in advance. Just remember: I win. You can't do anything to me.

The example is a poor one, and should be removed from the article. The article states that it seems to require 5 colors, presumably because the grey area cannot simply be colored red, yellow or blue without re-coloring. However, it *can* be colored green, and that doesn't require shuffling any of the other colors around. This makes it a very misleading counterexample. I know I spent a lot of time scratching my head wondering why this was considered a counter-example at all, and how the caption made any sense. Please either replace it with an example which does need to be re-colored in order to work or remove it (not that I don't think it's a valiant attempt, but it's just confusing).

"A sentence in the Social Issues section is rather misleading: it implies that opposition to the name change of the province comes from 'Non-Pashtun Hazara regions'. This is incorrect because  the majority of Hazara's population belong to various Pashtun tribes e.g. Yusufzai, Swati, Tanaoli, Jadun, Tahirkhelis etc. Even the Mashwanis and the Sayyids of Kaghan list themselves as Pashtuns despite being of Saadat origins. That a minority among these tribes speak Hindko does not imply a change of ethnicity. Although the section does reflect reality in that the region has been nefariously influenced by Punjab based politicians particularly the two factions of Pakistan Muslim League namely the Nawaz and Quaid leagues. Their internecine warfare in Punjab has over-spilled into Hazara and the Chaudry brothers of Quaid League have smelled an opening for their mischief against their nemesis the Sharif brothers who dropped their opposition and supported the name change.

Why? Required? Well, these questions go back to the old days. It used to be thought that redirects were bad, and we should avoid them, trying as hard as we can to replace them with the precise name. Then it was discovered that Google found things easier through redirects, and they provided a way for us refine Google's search semantics quite a bit. So it helps people find what they want, and avoids the problems of having to be too precise about linkages. Its more of a wiki way to do it. Not to mention that this type of linkage comes from our disambig policy, to use disambig pages liberally, but always be hierarchical according to common sense. More recently it was discovered that tools to """"fix"""" redirects (like the one in WP:POP) are hugely taxing on the server, so that ended the last of the purists crying about link precision. The funny thing is that link precision is actually a hindance to semantic searching. So, over the years the idea has been to make WP redirects function as a part of the semantic web. That's an explanation in a nutshell. -|vertigo """,0.0

Well Maybe theres a reason it was taken off. I think its because her voice isnt as good as it used to be. but still I say her range is Bb2-G#7 but all that can be proven is a range of C3-G#7. C3 is the lowest note in My All, Emotions, You're So Cold, and I believe other songs. A1 is my lowest note and F7 is my highest and Im a Lyric Baritone. I don't know if Mariah has ever sang above the piano or in the second octave because there is no audio to prove it. All I know is alot of people exaggerate her voice alot. Notes should be checked before saying what they are. People start rumors about alot of things like the note in You're So Cold being G2. Its not. My way of checking notes is by using a keyboard. its pretty accurate too. Its better than a tuner. Tuners can be thrown off by the slightest extra sound. the best way to check a note using a tuner is to copy the note by singing it yourself. But keyboards are easy cause it wont produce a note an octave lower or anything as most people tend to do if they feel a note is too high or an octave higher if the note is too low. You should always check a note yourself and ask another person if you can rely on them.  06:27",0.0

Each in turn

Suggested: In physics, force is the perceptible cause of the acceleration of a mass (change in the rate or direction of its motion) and is experienced as a push or a pull. instead of In physics, force is what causes a mass to accelerate experienced as a push or a pull.
The addition of """"and"""" is good. However, a force need not be """"perceived"""" to exist. The definition of """"acceleration"""" is indeed confusing to the lay person, but I think that the wikilink on acceleration covers it. We need to be careful to not go overboard in description in the lead.
Provide definition: """"momentum (quantity of motion)""""
Hmm, this isn't exactly an accurate definition of momentum since momentum is, in fact, both mass and motion. Again, the wikilink I think should suffice, but maybe we can reword things without providing definitions to make it clearer. I want this to be intelligible, but I'm afraid that including these points might be confusing for many and an annoyance to even more.
Following the development of quantum mechanics, it is now understood that momentum is a fundamental property of particles and that, according to the standard model of particle physics, changes in momentum are the consequence of the net emission or absorption by particles of momentum-carrying gauge bosons. Effects which are at the macro level experienced as a """"force"""" are the consequence of the aggregate effect of these boson-mediated fundamental interactions. In modern physics, only four fundamental interactions are known; in order of decreasing strength, they are: strong, electromagnetic, weak, and gravitational.[1] High-energy particle physics observations in 1970s and 1980s confirmed that the weak and electromagnetic forces are expressions of a unified electroweak interaction. No gauge boson has yet been demonstrated for mediating the gravitational interaction and what is perceived as the """"force"""" of gravity is more accurately attributable to the the effect of distortions by massive bodies of the curvature of spacetime as explicated in Einstein's Theory of General Relativity.
There is a slight issue here with the sentence: """"Effects which are at the macro level experienced as a """"force"""" are the consequence of the aggregate effect of these boson-mediated fundamental interactions."""" This sentence misses the fact that forces also exist on the micro level. A single boson-mediated fundamental interaction often has a """"force"""" associated with it. For example, an electron accelerates because it emits a photon: this is due to the electromagnetic force acting on the electron. One micro-interaction: still a force since a mass accelerated.

I will implement the wording I think is good, but let's keep discussing the problematic wording.

 It's really rather sad 

That I can ask an otherwise legitimate question on a talk page like this, but because one person does not like the way I phrased it, it is suddenly """"vandalism"""" and deleted completely.  If anything, you could say I was rude in the way I asked my question, but as far as I can tell, vandalism = intentionally disruptive edits, and, more importantly, edits to actual articles.  These talk pages are intended to talk, are they not?  The standards of writing something in an encyclopedic manner do not apply here.

At least from my understanding.

But even if they do, assuming that my post was solely created as a vandalism, when I was asking an otherwise legitimate question, is completely unnecessary.  Or are those policies such as """"WP:Assume Good Faith"""" or whatever all for show after all?  Seems very seldom that people actually do assume good faith around here.  They're just as happy to tag anything they don't like as vandalism, even more so if the person posting it isn't a regular.

I dunno, just a few observations.  I'll admit that I don't edit here often, so if I've somehow missed something that somehow changes the situation completely, feel free to let me know.

 Hi Nabeelsahab, thanks for the note. There are a number of problems with your edit on Zad al-Ma'ad. Firstly, the content you added seems to have been copied and pasted from http://www.kalamullah.com/zaad-al-maad.html. The text is therefore copyrighted material and should be removed. Please see Wikipedia:Copy-paste.

Secondly, Wikipedia articles are required to present a neutral point of view based on reliable secondary sources. Websites such as kalamullah.com are not considered reliable due to there polemic and sectarian nature. Neutral sources include media agencies such as the BBC or academic sources. Please read WP:RS. There are a number of academic sources on Ibn Qayyim such as the works of Livnat Holtzman and Jon Hoover which you should consider looking into that might provide reliable and accurate information about Zad al-Ma'ad.

Thirdly, the language of the article needs to be Encyclopedic. Claims such as """"This book is one of the important resources of knowledge for those who seek to know the Seerah.."""" seems to be an example of puffery. Please read  WP:PUFF.

Fourthly, adding statements such as """"Available from Australian Islamic Library website"""" seems to be a clear case of WP:PROMOTION. Zad al-Ma'ad is available in a whole series of websites such as http://d1.islamhouse.com/data/en/ih_books/single/en_Complete_Zaad_al_Maad.pdf, http://idci.co.uk/Provisions-For-The-Hereafter-Mukhtasar-Zad-Al-maad-699-d etc.... so there is no need to specify the Australian Islamic Library in particular.

Admins: Please note that per Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/St_Christopher, accounts which have the single purpose of editing this article and its talk page may be considered as a single editor, are restrained from making disruptive edits, and may be banned if they do so.  Current single purpose accounts are:   

This is how Leuko typically tries to deal with editors who don't agree with his point of view when editing this article, he tries to silence them rather than hash it out in good faith. You can see that my account in not single purpose since I have a number of edits (minor, but still edits, I'm more of a WikiGnome in other areas) in other articles. You will also notice that even though  

Actually 75% of the contribs from this IP address are related to this article, so considering other people may have made some of the non-related edits, that indicates that this is a WP:SPA for editing this article. I grouped the SPA's together because as the ArbCom case said, they can be regarded as a single editor using sockpuppets when editing disruptively. I'll add the other one too if it makes you happy. I try and WP:AGF too, but it's hard with the history of abusive sockpuppetry and personal attacks perpetuated in the past, which still continues.  

75% means that 1 out of 4 edits has been on articles outside this area, that's not a terrible ratio, and certainly shows this is not a WP:SPA. Also, if you look at the quality of the edits you will notice that the majority of that 75% are to rephrase comments I have made or simple/minor spacing or formatting issues. It may be your opinion that the edits by the users you listed were """"disruptive"""" but I doubt you will find a reasonable person that will agree with you on this. I agree that it's unfortunate that some biased editors continue there attacks and campaign of disinformation but it seems that some people just can't help themselves.  

Demanding that information be removed because other editors would not provide you with a physical copy of a newspaper article which is cited is definitely not productive.  Now I had to look up what a buckytube was, but I don't think this comment was very supportive of the nature of the edits on this page: .  

Well, that's your opinion. Actually, since you were able to prove the existence of the article without a physical copy demonstrates that it was rather easy to obtain verification. I don't think asking for verification for information that is included in an article in what is supposedly an """"encyclopedia"""" is asking too much. Without verification Wikipedia would be no better than any other garbage out there on the internet. Do you really think that even basic verification to prove that material even existed is unnecessary?  

Yes, it was rather easy to obtain for someone who had the desire to actually re-verify a source which has been there for a year. I don't know why it needed to be such a difficult process.  

You tell me, you were the one that was complaining about it being so difficult.

I am perfectly glad, and have been all along, to see this section totally removed from this article. When we spun out the fuller version of this, I wanted to delete this shortened version from here. However, if it stays, I remain concerned what it says, and you and I obviously disagree about that.

 As for your """"obviously"""": Once again, you seem to be reading sentences out of context. Look at the context of this passage (italics added for emphasis):

""""There was division within the left as to the invasion of Afghanistan.  Nonetheless, an international anti-war movement began to arise; in the U.S. and other countries whose governments enacted legislation analogous to the PATRIOT Act, it was equally a movement in protest of what were perceived to be assaults on civil liberties and immigrant rights.""""

""""Most prominent in this loose coalition were...""""

This is specifically about the protest movement at the time of the Afghanistan invasion (and was more exclusively so in earlier versions, because someone has now inserted """"and Iraq"""" in the next sentence). You say there was no anti-Afganistan-invasion-movement worth mentioning. Don't know where you were. I was in London at the time. 50,000 of us were in Trafalgar Square, that's usually considered a large enough protest to be worth mentioning. I can't say for sure how large rallies were elsewhere at the time, but these links are suggestive: , . Here's a statement of protest by a Canadian Senator on October 26, 2001.. It would take a lot of time to really document the level of protest activity at that time, and it was certainly not nearly as much as later over Iraq, but it is much more relevant to the topic of the Left, becuase opposition was narrower and the Left had a more prominent role.   | Talk 07:16, Jan 4,""",0.0

I don't see anything about this in the manual of style or in the TV-specific guidelines at WikiProject Television.  This might be a matter that could be taken there to see if there's a consensus on what should be done.  I personally think we should go with what the episode credits say (using things like Jeffrey Lieber and J.J. Abrams & Damon Lindelof).  This way, we preserve the information about who worked together and who worked separately.  Since the information is in a table and not in the middle of a sentence, I see no reason to correct grammar here (and I'm usually really picky about grammar).  The best example that comes to mind is Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl where the credits list writers as Ted Elliott & Terry Rossio and Stuart Beattie and Jay Wolpert.  Clearly, the first two worked together, while the last two worked independently of the others.  I think that information is important and (if it were an episode of a TV series) should be listed as such in the episode table.  Whenever I type in writers, I always go with whatever the episode says (of course, from what I can remember, I've never dealt with an episode from more than two writers before).

Invitation and Recommendations for writing articles on Hindi Wikipedia

Hindi wikipedia invites and welcomes Wikipedians to contribute for the cause of spreading knowledge and the Hindi language. This page contains guidelines for writing a wiki-article on any topic at the Hindi Wikipedia, with special recommendations for writing in Hindi (Note: The script/font-family for Hindi is Devanāgari; the script/font-system for English is Roman script, also, the Hindi spelling system is not completely standardized). This article is yet in English language (mostly), in order to encourage even non-native/foreign people who have learnt/are learning Hindi to contribute to the Hindi wikipedia, and native Hindi speakers who normally write in English. The examples given below are only for explanation.

Recommendations:
Firstly for proper viewing, it is recommended to keep all links NOT-UNDERLINED. Otherwise the मात्रा below the Hindi alphabets might get partly hidden behind the underlines. For this, please go to My Preferences (मेरी पसंद) at the top of the page, then click Misc., and then choose """"underline links -> Never"""". Save your settings. Also, do not click yes for """"justify paragraphs"""", otherwise on some browsers, the devanagari script will appear highly distorted.
All users are requested and encouraged to contribute articles here, especially, to create new articles on general topics. They are also encouraged to expand the existing articles, and improve upon them. A non-user can also do the same; it is recommended but not required to register yourself as a wikipedian user at the Hindi wikipedia. As far as possible, each article should be written with a Neutral Point of View (NPOV)—no nationalistic or partiality or hatred based articles are welcome. The articles should be based on facts—and appropriate references should be provided as and where needed. See the English wiki's help page for editing in general. Almost all the general wiki-features are available for editing on Hindi wiki too. Guidelines for the content matter is mostly the same as given in English wiki.
Since the Hindi wiki is at its initial stages, users are welcome to take introduction and basic points from the English (or another) wikipedia's corresponding article and translate them for small articles. An in-page link to the English wiki's article will be deemed sufficient for references (a template might be created stating this). For longer articles, it is recommended to mention the references separately. 
Since most computer users in India and elsewhere have the standard Western-type keyboard, it is best recommended (but not necessarily required) to use the virtual (software) keyboard like the one of Hindimozhi or of ISIS (Tavultesoft Keyman)—which are freewares. These are advantageous because the contemporary Hindi-speakers in India often write messages/chat using Hindi words but written in Roman (English) script, and the layout of these keyboards is quite the same that such people use. For example, using the """"normal"""" keyboard with this software, typing ga would give ग and ghaa would give घा.
Create the article with its name written in Hindi (devanagari script). Always take care to include the nukta (dot below) for foreign / Urdu loanwords wherever it occurs in the standard spelling. For non-Indian names, use that spelling (for article name and other words) which is commonly encountered in Hindi newspapers, G.K.-books, Hindi-dubbed TV documentaries and Hollywood films and magazines. e.g., America-अमरीका (या अमेरिका), China-चीन, French-फ़्रांसिसी. For English acronyms/short-forms, use the initials in Roman script, and again create a full form in Hindi and redirect it to the short form. e.g. IPA (अन्तर्राष्ट्रीय ध्वनि वर्णाक्षर); UNO (संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघ). Doing the opposite is also fine. But creating the article with the Hindi short form, as सं०रा०सं०, is not recommended. Also, the article proper must be written with the proper nukta, as फ़ारसी, and then, a non-nukta (mis-)spelt version फारसी should preferably be created to redirect to the correct spelling.
Hindi wikipedia strongly recommends the users to write articles in everyday common Hindi in the खड़ीबोली dialect (Hindustani or Hindi-Urdu, i.e., बोलचाल वाली हिन्दी, which may include many loanwords from Persian and Arabic). The use of शुद्ध संस्कृतनिष्ठ हिन्दी  is in general neither required nor recommended. E.g., use: वजह instead of कारण, ख़ास instead of विशेष, वगैरह instead of इत्यादि, लेकिन instead of परन्तु etc. However, for technical and specialized vocabulary, the use of शुद्ध संस्कृतनिष्ठ हिन्दी  is recommended and usually",0.0

"DID CHRISTIANS INVENT SATAN.
The idea that Christians invented Satan is lies, propogated by some adherents of WICCA and other pagan believers, we see that the Holy Scriptures that came from Judaism has a book called JOB, so why blame the christians!, rather The Scriptures reveals in Genesis how EVE was tempted by the Serpent, who had refused to worship adam, also later we see that David is tricked into taking a census by SATAN (Old Testament 2 Samuel) later on further we see that Jesus himsels is accused of casting out demons by the power of Beelzebul (Satan) by Pharisees, Jesus refutes the accusations of the Pharisees. In the NT we hear that I saw Satan cast out of Heaven as lightning striketh from the east to the West. So also In Revelations we hear that there was WAR IN HEAVEN and St. Michael and all the Loyal Angels to GOD fought against the followers of Satan and the Battle was won by the GOOD ANGELS, revelation also reveals, woe unto man for the Devil has come down to earth, being fierce and wrathful and know his time to be short! Also elsewhere we hear that Satan is likened to a lion on the prowl going to and fro throughout the earth to see whom he can devour. Christ was tempted by the Shaitan 3 times after his Baptism in the desert. So to say that We Christians invented something which was already revealed in Judaism and OT is silly and obnoxious. The Devil had pride, then disobedience, then Jealousy, then slander, then much later we learn that Jesus called the Satan a liar, murderer and thief.
Why dont the WICCANS look to Zoroastriaism or other DUALISTIC Religions and see the concept of GOOD VERSUS EVIL in those religions? Why, so that the Christians get the blame for something that actually EXISTS. Even the Muslim believe in a the serpent called Iblis, and even buddhists had a concept for the Evil One called MARA, who was a TEMPTER. Jesus even spoke to St. Peter and said that the Devil had been given permission to sift St. Peter like wheat, whereby Jesus siad that he had prayed for CEPHAS such that he would not enter into temptation. The truth seems to be that the devil was an Arc Angel in Heaven, who became too full of himself, later whe GOD created MAN in HIS OWN IMAGE, GOD requests all the Angels to BOW to ADAM, all do except for ONE ANGEL (later called LUCIFER). He refuses based on himself being made of fire and that Adam is made of clay, however, GOD allows the satan to act as an adversary to mankind as can be seen in JOB, some mention that in ISAIAH: O Lucifer sun of the morning how thou art fallen from the Heavenn is a direct reference to the DEVIL, but I also consider it to BABYLOON, as in revelation, fallen, fallen is BABYLON the GREAT etc. Revelations has many warnings and prophesies concerning those who worship the evil one etc and their name are not written in the book of life. GOD has talks with the SATAN, so SATAN can not be inferred thence to be a non-entity, as GOD does not talk to non-entities. Also some people believe that the DARK SIDE of human nature to be some impersonal evil, others realise that this is negative non-sense. I know that people were possessed by demons, fallen spirits and that Jesus cast some of them out and they came out screaming 'Ha, Jesus you Nazorean, what hast thou to do with us, hast thou come before the alotted time to torture us!', Jesus then would tell the demon/s to shut up or be quiet! So far as I concerned the truth is in the Holy Bible, some truth is also in the Quran.
There are some truths to be found also in other religious books, but the whole truth is Christ and the books of OT and NT are inspired by the Holy Spirit. Have a read of Revelation and read it aloud to someone and you will get a blessing from GOD! 

Enough of this rubbish about Christian inventions of spirits. Pagans invented their gods, and invented strange myths concerning their false gods.

Jews and Christians had the opposite, GOD revealed to them the TRUTH and THE WAY, AND THE LIFE.

Your reference to Canarias is understandable. However, Morocco cannot validly claim the canaries because there are 2 million canarians who are neither arabs nor muslims and who are spaniards wishing to remain part of the EU and of a democratic state. Morocco has no relation whatsoever with the canaries at any level neither culturally nor historically. If there was such a relation and morroco was a functioning democracy i would be the first to support a morrocan claim on the islands. I understand, for example and contrary to most spaniards, morocco's claim on western sahara. Firstly, the saharaouis are very few and their independence would clearly have been the result of european colonialism of the maghreb and algerian expansionism in the region. I understand how countries which have been subjected to the humiliation of colonialism feel, their borders being decided by foreign powers, and i believe that the polisario should take their people out of the horrendous conditions they live in in the camps of Tindouf and move back to their land.

I've worked in digital cash for about 20 years; it's clear that digital bearer token money (i.e. Chaumian blinded money) could be used to represent arbitrary assets.  There is a difference between distributed and centralized systems, and right now the only really viable distributed model is blockchain based, but the distinction shouldn't be """"cryptocurrency vs. non-cryptocurrency"""", but """"blockchain-based cryptocurrency vs. blinded token cryptocurrency"""".  They're both distinct from account-based money.

There are ways in which blinded money is actually *more* cryptocurrency than blockchain money  by eliminating the historical record of linkability inherent in the blockchain or account-based systems, blinded tokens are inherently fungible, which supports negotiability and finality.

I'm not sure what the solution is to this article; move it en-masse to """"blockchain currency"""" or merge with bitcoin and then redirect cryptocurrency to digital cash?

"Sick POV
What the hell? 
User:Izady is a sick fuck:

It should be noted that the conditions in which individuals died varies from site to site. The people that were buried in these graves are believed to have been members of the Kurdish population which was in support of Iranian occupancy of Iraq at the time of their death (circa 1980's) 'and who deserved to die in the hands of patriotic Sunni Arabs of Iraq'. The legitimacy of claims of atrocity are debateable for this reason, 'since Sunni Arabs are too honorable to do any such things'. The distinction between those who have died in military style combat or executed under the direction of a lawful court of President Saddam Hussein, although buried disrespectfully, and those who have been victims of genocide, ethnic cleansing or otherwise murdered innocently and buried efficiently is a bright line; mass burial should not be assumed to be evidence of criminal activity. 'These Shia and Kurds were traitors to Iraq and were fairly tried and executed by the patriot Arab Sunnis for their crimes', although the burial was not always respectful. Victims of chemical weapons are unknown, 'and they too were traitor Kurds and deserved the punishment by the patriotic Saddam government'.",0.42857142857142855
"List of ice hockey teams in Ontario 

I updated Template:OHL and Template:Defunct OHL to try to simplify things. Template:OHL contains all teams past and current for the OHL. Template:Defunct OHL contains all past teams from the OMJHL and the OHA Junior A. That template may need to be renamed. 

Regarding the article List of ice hockey teams in Ontario. How should we handle the defunct teams from the OHL, OMJHL, and OHA Junior A?  
That is a really good question.  I would like to add them, as it would allow the list to be both complete, and consistant with the others.  I havent added defunct Jr A teams on any other article, but many of these OHA Jr A teams were the highest level of Junior hockey at the time, I believe, so should be added as being equivalent of Major-Junior.  However, that will likely make this a really long list.  It might make sense to split the article into two: active and defunct  as I did with the baseball lists. I would suggest expanding the defunct teams and seeing how long the article gets, then deciding from there.  If we hope to get it to featured list status, as I would like for all, then we can't use the template as a part of the article itself.",0.0

 Studia humanitates 

The Humane studies, According to Cicero:

Rationale for humane studies (letters)
""""Si ex his studiis delectatio sola peteretur, tamen, ut opinor, hanc animi remissionem humanissimam ac liberalissimam iudicaretis. Nam ceterae neque temporum sunt neque aetatum omnium neque locorum; at haec studia adulescentiam alunt, senectutem oblectant, res secundas ornant, adversis perfugium ac solacium praebent, delectant domi, non impediunt foris, pernoctant nobiscum, peregrinantur, rusticantur.""""""""Even if mere entertainment were our only objective in the study of literature, you would still, in my opinion, regard this pursuit as the most humanizing and liberating of intellectual activities. For no other pursuit is appropriate to all times, all ages, all situations; but this study nurtures our youth, delights our old age, brightens the good times, and provides a refuge and comfort in bad times; literature brings us pleasure at home, does not hamper us at work, and is the companion of our nights, our travels, our country retreats."""": Cicero, Pro Archia Archia Poeta 7.16):

Cicero speaks elsewhere, in his treatises De Officiis and De Republica, on the ethics of war, acknowledging that war is sometimes inevitable but that the first recourse in international conflict resolution should always be to negotiation rather than to violence, cum illud proprium sit hominis, hoc belvarum (""""since the one course of action is appropriate to humankind, the other to beasts,"""" De Off. 1.11.34). 

In the Middle Ages, law students studied rhetoric, or the art of persuasion, as an essential technique of their profession. In the Renaissance, however, beginning with Petrarch (c. 1310-1380) there was a movement to focus on the philosophical purpose of persuasion, which was to lead men to wisdom (virtue). The humanists looked to Cicero and other Latin authors as their guides, both stylistic and philosophical. Teachers of rhetoric, called dictatores, began also to write treatises on government. They also called into question more traditional Medieval educational programs, which had become a very theoretical and technical study devoted to the fine points of Aristotelean logic and syllogisms, and which featured incorrect and sloppy Latin.

The subjects of the studia humanitatis of classical tradition are: Poetry (see above); Rhetoric (developing a polished style), History (which teaches prudence, one of the most important political virtues), and ancient Moral and Political Philosophy. See Quentin Skinner, Visions of Politics, Vol. III: Renaissance Virtues (Cambridge University Press, [2002] 2007), p. 2.  The virtues essential for the citizens and leaders of a well ordered commonwealth comprise: Prudence, Fortitude (courage), Temperance, and Justice (to which Magnanimity, a Stoic, or Senecan virtue, was sometimes added). See Skinner, p. 96. The Heavenly virtues of Faith, Hope, and Charity were above, but did not supersede these. Rather they completed them. In the Renaissance it was thought that virtue rather than birth constituted true nobility.

Humanistic study of ancient texts used comparative analysis, and achieved great things. Comparing the style of one textual copy to another of the same work, for example, they could detect inconsistencies and error. Comparing texts of different authors, they learned to identify different styles and periods. The continued use of this form of analysis eventually (very slowly) led to a new way of viewing history as embodying to continuous change and development, of  languages, works of art and literature, as well as of institution. This kind of thinking gradually undermined the former view of humanity and its works as uniform and unchanging. It is not the same as experimental science, but it is a kind of thinking essential to any kind of rational knowledge.173.56.164.199  """,0.0

You seem to think this is a """"battle of the dialects"""". At the same time, you assume I am thinking the same thing. However, I DO NOT think of this as a """"battle of the dialects"""" at all, I think of it as a LOGICAL consensus that needs to replace the current one.

Lordkazan, I am currently looking for suitable citations. But still, I feel my original point was intentionally overlooked. You see, recently, I edited a German article concerning a Neonazi brand name (de:Consdaple). In that article, I inserted totally """"biased"""" ridiculing phrases, because I felt that in Germany, it is always better to decidedly distance yourself from Nazism (and because I am rather convinced of my eloquence in German, although I am certainly not as godlike at it as Avi is with English). Now, with the circumcision article, I have a similar dilemma. But my POV here is, although not more biased than with the Nazi topic, not the Public POV. And that's what I meant in the circumcision discussion: My POV is that there is no NPOV besides the instantaneous total rejection of neonatal genital mutilation, be it in Jewish tradition or whatever. And all that pointing to the respective guidelines by Avi or Jakew won't change that. But the article does not even feature the word """"intact"""", which in itself (the word and its rejection by the pro-biased lobby) is sufficient proof to me that they will never cease to bombard common sense. So alright, I'm Sancho Pansa, but do you really believe in playing the game like this? After all, Jakew doesn't have a problem with the Wikipedia guidelines, because his personal bias is similar to the American/community bias on the topic of circumcision.  """,0.0

You were having too much fun abusing your moderator privileges by placing temporary blocks on me, trying to stop me from making my point and trying to give this hugely offensive other user a chance to avoid a police investigation, by mod-vandalizing discussions on the subject etc. - against most other moderators (private) views even - they had the sense not to start a mod war on the subject. Your 500 page nerd-o-pedia rule-book and abusing it to the point of idiocy was more interesting to you. Apparently you felt that since you had read it, everyone else should waste at least as much time and read it too down to every last letter, or you were gonna use it against all common sense toward anyone who didn't - with no regard for the actual situation and reasons behind it, no regard for that individuals contributions, no regard for civility - and most of all, with no common sense applied whatsoever.

It's indeed too bad that most pages on nerd-o-pedia are starting to be shockingy un-maintained and obsolete, indeed dead now that the initial rush of contributors is over after a few years, and the fun is over for most people - as, the most brutal blow of all, moderators such as YOU have managed to destroy the morale of even the most serious contributors and have had them leave. They simply did not wish to spend too much time arguing or alternatively face putting up with arrogant admin behavior, because it always will start to take more of your time than contributions here, because of people like YOU, and how wrong the principles are how admins are selected here. It's all about brown-nosing with the crowd and building your giant online virtual ego and lick the ass of other even more OCD nerds who are already admins, and you're just a wannabe. 

Good ****ing luck trying to get anything edited or updated here in a year or two besides top 10 whatever pop bands may be popular at the time, the latest tv show pages and some other obsessive-compulsive nerdishm. Nobody is foolish enough to put up with the crap that comes along with the job, from people such as YOU.

For example, the pages on my subjects were very active till late 2006, and since that they have... well. Remained in the same form as the core contributors left them, as they left this site. No updates. I'm truly not the only one to eject. Not worth the effort to contribute when all you get is shitted all over, if you ever need any help.

It's kind of funny that an admin can burn out of this site too, but given your attitude back then, I'm not surprised you did. After all, there were some decent admins here back then (such as  ), and I'm sure there's a few now, but WAY too many nerds for whom it is the biggest thing of their lives, and they have to show it, and snoop their noses everywhere. But like I said, as even admins are dropping out, what do you think happened to the contributors? Many pages now are actually full of incorrect shit, because no people of expertise hang around any more to correct details, and newbies or worse, malicious trollers slowly degrade the content that once was at least somehow accurate and relevant. Admins will be happy to see updates to the page, but the fact is, most of the updates today are degenerating the pages, obfuscating subjects and adding factual errors and garbage.

And too bad you didn't quit a year ago, I might still be here, and there would probably be several thousands of lines, and few hundred articles more, along with maybe ~1000 more photographs.

 Tedious 

Look, this courtesy police thing is very tedious Your first warning was in the context of a pretty mild remark, where I happened to use the word """"disingenuous"""" in reference to someone's argument.  In this case, I'm sure I didn't respond particularly appropriately, but the whole thing is irritating.  It's particularly irritating to be informed of things by a bot.  And also irritating to get what are obviously public domain images deleted on the basis of this sourcing nonsense.  I haven't corrected it any further because PD Thor decided to reupload the same image and then orphan it, so I assume it will be deleted, so I'm not going to bother with fixing it, but really the whole thing is absurd.  I notice you say that the image's copyright status cannot be corroborated.  That is obvious nonsense.  PD Thor, the one who noticed its supposed """"unsourcedness"""", managed very easily to find a copy of the same map on the US government website and reupload it.  About two minutes of searching on the US Census website, I think, pretty much brings it up.  It is also identical to 49 or so other county maps present on wikipedia, most of which, I think, are sourced.  So, yeah, this is technically unsourced.  But a little common sense should tell anyone that it's obviously PD, and the right course should really be to find the source information oneself, rather than to threaten deletion and leave people to get obnoxious bot messages about it.  The whole way images are dealt with on Wikipedia is so byzantine and confusing as to be infuriating.  At any rate, any future messages from you on my talk page sternly warning me to be civil will be deleted without further comment.  I'm not interested in hearing from you about this subject, and your intervention does not make me feel particularly inclined to modify my conduct.  I will strive, as always, to avoid personal attacks.  I am sure that, on occasion, my emotions will get the better of me and I will screw up.  If you are concerned about such further instances, feel free to report me to the proper authorities, or what not.  I will add that I don't see how my role as an administrator is at all relevant here.  When I was promoted to administrator, at least, the idea of an administrator was basically someone who had been on wikipedia long enough that they were generally trusted to use the abilities of an administrator in a responsible fashion.  Whether or not I sometimes fly off the handle and use profanities, I am fairly certain that I have never abused my authority as an administrator, which I almost exclusively use to delete pages for moves.  I don't think I have ever inappropriately blocked a user or deleted a page.  There was at least one incident where I was accused of protecting a page inappropriately, but I think that was at least arguably justified.  So I feel like I'm pretty conscientious about my role as an administrator, and try hard not to abuse that power.  The idea that I have to be a model of ideal behavior in every other respect because of said status is a tenet that I do not hold.  Best,   """,0.0

Hi GotR. I would like to see you edit here again, as you have been doing a great job on subdivisions of China (although I believe you are exaggerating your irreplaceability: just because nobody hasn't picked up the job yet, it does not mean nobody will, and there is no WP:DEADLINE), but there are a couple of things you should think about before you are unblocked. One is that you should stop focusing on whether or not your indefblock was justified. What happened to you (blocks escalated after you didn't keep your cool while being blocked, but instead throwing red flags like new accounts in the face of all admins) isn't a case of you being singled out by an abusive admin, but actually fairly typical admin behaviour. At some point we tend to lose our patience and decide that a user is more trouble than they are worth (and the community expects us to make such decisions). You have a collection of accounts, all with block logs attached, that make it a bit wearying to even try to find out whether you were treated fairly at all times in the past. I think that you should stick to one account, strictly limit yourself to one revert, and you should not expect to find justice on Wikipedia for everything wrong that has happened to you. If others make a decision about you that you think is unfair and wrong, please first try to understand where they are coming from before you title your unblock request """"to right a great wrong"""".

- the article states that they activists """"attempted to board,"""" but not """"trespassed.""""
- """"Certain pharmaceutical drugs are kept in a safe. The Russian authorities broke the safe after they took the vessel.[36]"""" Sounds like it was written by GP. Relies on a GP source.
- """"Two activists managed to attach themselves to the platform and attempted to climb despite being blasted with water, whilst another activist was unable to attach themself to the platform."""" Aside from the poor style, the poor construction, and the awkward attempt to make it gender neutral, it reads like the person that wrote the sentence wants the reader to cheer for the GP activists. What does it mean """"to attach oneself to a platform""""? 
- """"Russian authorities forcibly took control of the Arctic Sunrise, which was boarded from a helicopter by fifteen Federal Security Service officers in balaclavas, armed with guns and knives."""" Is it unusual that the Federal Service would wear balaclavas or arm themselves with guns and knives? Given the task that they were performing, such a uniform seems routine.
- """"At the time of the boarding, the Arctic Sunrise was in Russia's EEZ but not within the safety zone around the oil rig, and permission was not sought to board it from the Arctic Sunrise's flag state, the Netherlands."""" Does Russia need permission from NL to board a ship that is clearly dedicated to enabling activists to trespass on a Russian oil rig? It's implied. If it's true, it should be noted. If not, it should be removed. 
- """"It is alleged that crew members and activists were punched and kicked during the forced boarding."""" Alleged by whom? Why were they punched and kicked? Were the guards using more than the necessary amount of force to subdue non-cooperative and/or combative arrestees? 
- The use of the monicker """"Arctic 30"""" implies a sympathetic viewpoint. Just because certain media have used the term, doesn't mean that WP should also. Just because certain media organizations are sympathetic doesn't mean WP should be also. It becomes a biased article when it uses such monickers that are intended to create sympathy for those arrested. 
- Nearly the entire """"Responses"""" section is irrelevant except for the responses and requests from the Gov't of NL. Seriously, does anyone really consider it WP worthy that a reporter wrote something on Facebook?
- The """"Greenpeace Announcements"""" section seems like a thinly veiled medium for advocating GP's position. Perhaps a """"Russian Government Announcements"""" would balance the article a bit, but the idea of such a section seems silly. 
- International Reaction section. Again, seems like a thinly veiled medium for listing anyone and any no one that supports GP. I don't see the relevance. Additionally, how is this section different from the """"Responses"""" section?""",0.0

Ok, then the section should be condensed to discuss the aspects in particular where D contributes to generic programming. If Dmeranda is correct in that """"static if"""" is a completely other take on generics then that point need to be discussed and exemplified, and I'm not certain if the factorial example is an adequate illustration of this since I failed to get that point. Also, the alias parameters seems to be of relevance and a discussion about these should be added. Static derival of return types risks venturing into pure language comparisons since C++0x will be equipped with a of_type (forgot what it is to be named) static operator and other languages have this facility too. Thus in short, the section should be condensed, sharpened to drive the relevant points home, and a better example should be found (invented?). I am doing a bold edit to test your reaction: since the """"D templates"""" section is in all a commentary on the """"C++ templates"""" section, I'm moving it to that section as a corollary.

The Colgan reference is an alternative medicine supporter. Barrett criticizes alternative medicine. This is not a third-party ref. BLP is highly relevant while the BLP violation text is unrelated to Quackwatch.

 missing sentence 

previous version

Quackwatch has been regularly criticized by the groups it investigates, such as herbalists, homeopaths and other alternative medicine practitioners.[7] A number of practitioners and supporters of alternative medicine criticize Quackwatch for its criticism of alternative medicine.[67][69][70] Of one of the criticisms, Bao-Anh Nguyen-Khoa wrote, """"It appears that Quackwatch.com uses the emotional reaction of its critics to substantiate its position.""""[40]

David Hufford, Professor of Medical Humanities at the Penn State College of Medicine, wrote an opinion paper in which he asserts that Quackwatch would be more effective if it relied more on research and less on personal beliefs.[70] In regard to the debate over water fluoridation, an anti-fluoridation article in the National Review quotes a """"generally informative and persuasive"""" Quackwatch article,[71] but criticizes its rhetorical style as """"perhaps not the best way to win an argument, especially with serious-minded people.""""[72]

Destroy the opposition
Well great, this oddly framed RfC has resulted in the addition of a few words, and the utter destruction of the good faith of several long-term editors.  Of course, Flyer22 has already predicted this, she has a special link to the future, and as she has told me, she is far better placed to predict the future than me.

A smug """"I know better"""" predeliction and a victim complex is seriously a problem.  I know for a fact that many editors who used to hold her in esteem are now looking long and hard at her contributions, to check that this individual isn't so buoyed up that she starts to believe her own press.

Anma seriously you really have some issues that need to be addressed. Although I have spoken to other editors, they have been professional and helpful whereas you have been incredibly insulting, plus your behavior is considered harassment (even if Wikipedia defines it differently, I know and trained in these matters and this does qualify, and at the end of the day that will overrule any website). Somehow you always seem to be on top of things should a change be made on the YCDTOTV page. Which leads me to think you are indeed watching the page, and you are probably the original author and a huge fan of the show, and you don't like the idea of someone else coming in and editing or adding on to your work. I'm sorry but you are behaving like a bully. You're right my comment was not a threat, but it is a warning not necessarily for Wikipedia but for the real world. At some point someone will put their foot down and say enough is enough this behavior is inappropriate and there will be consequences. You can't act like this it is called a power trip. Also think about it for a second if you look at our past disputes it normally is because I have made multiple changes on multiple pages, so maybe the Amyas """"update"""" was just a small snafu as I did not touch anything else.

"At WP:DRN we volunteers have a fairly broad discretion within DRN to do whatever we think will best resolve the conflict (we have that freedom because we have zero authority and you can freely ignore us), and in my considered opinion, the combination of you filing the dispute with a nonexistent article name, you filing as an IP when you have a user name, and the preliminary reaction of the other editors named, led me to believe that the dispute would be more likely to be resolved if you refiled with the right article name and with you logged in.

As for the rights of IP users vs logged in users, yes, editing semi-protected articles is one difference (neither group can edit fully protected articles) but that is not the only difference. See Wikipedia:IPs are human too#What an unregistered user can't do for a complete list.

In your case, the problem is not the IP, but rather editing under two different accounts (logged in and not logged in). When registered users sign out of their accounts and contribute under their IP address, it makes it difficult to see their true editing history.

"Request to Unblock
I began writing the following statement (excepting its two postscripts) before I was blocked. I suspect that User: AuburnPilot had me blocked, in order to prevent me from complaining to administrators about his misconduct. Although I was directed to request an unblock of User: Physicq210, who had blocked me, requesting such of the latter would require that I censor myself, and write as though User: Physicq210 had acted in good faith, and was one of the good guys. That would be surreal, and would give User: Physicq210 a moral legitimacy belied by his actions. And so, the following request for unblocking is directed at any administrator BUT User: Physicq210, but since I’m not a devious sort, I have nothing against the latter reading this. Indeed, I want User: Physicq210 to read it. For if I can be banned from Wikipedia for standing up to censors, then it is vastly preferable to go down fighting, than to go down the long dark road of self-abnegation and self-censorship, including the use of bad English. After all, if I wanted to be a lackey, I could go to graduate school.

WIKI Administrators’ Notice Board Incidents
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents

User: AuburnPilot

A few days ago, User: AuburnPilot began stalking me, checking wherever I had made edits, and going to the articles in question and vandalizing them. He or she has been manipulating Wikipedia rules as cover for what is clearly political censorship. User: AuburnPilot cannot even stand for Wikipedia readers to find out about factual material that upsets his political applecart through footnotes. Zero tolerance!

He claims of any source he politically dislikes, that it is either “spam” or a “blog” (or “POV,” another favorite dodge for those at Wikipedia seeking to censor those who fail to conform to their own POV), even though the one source is a previously published, classic magazine article otherwise unavailable on the Web (http://geocities.com/nstix/waronpolice.html), which the author has seen fit to publish on his Web site, and the other source is the longest, most thorough exposé yet published on the Duke rape hoax (http://vdare.com/stix/070113_duke.htm).

Note that I am not even talking about censoring writing within articles, since I hadn’t done any writing on the articles in question: Crystal Gail Mangum, Michael Nifong, 2006 Duke University lacrosse team scandal and Racial profiling.
I’ve been involved in edit wars before, though I have never been the aggressor, and have never initiated an elective edit war, though given the self-assurance that aggressors such as User: AuburnPilot exude, perhaps I ought to reconsider that position. It seems that aggressors rule here.

The reason I am making a formal complaint is that User: AuburnPilot has tonight upped the ante, threatening to have me banned
(http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:70.23.199.239&redirect;=no), if I do not surrender to his censorship. Should you find for me, please serve this individual with the wikiquivalent of a cease-and-desist order. Should you, however, find for the censor, please provide an Index of banned publications and a list of official wikicensors.

P.S. January 19, 2007 115A EST. Since beginning this complaint, I see that User: AuburnPilot has in fact succeeded at getting a crony, User: Physicq210, to block me, thus not only getting administrative support in censoring me, but preventing me from responding to his thuggery. (And no, I am not going to use cutesy, euphemistic language. If I were into such deception, I would have become a liar, er, lawyer, and would be worthless as an encyclopedist.) And I was unable to e-mail User: Physicq210 because I am not logged in and “You must be logged in and have a valid authenticated e-mail address in your preferences to send e-mail to other users.” (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Emailuser/Physicq210)

If this isn’t cyber-Stalinism, I don’t know what is! So, let me get this straight. Stalking and censoring an editor while using the equivalent of smiley faces (User: AuburnPilot’s penchant for saying “Thank you” after vandalizing one’s links) is “civil,” but complaining about such abuse counts as “spam, disruption, incivility, and personal attacks.” If that is verily so, then 2 + 2 = 5.

P.P.S The message here says that I was “temporarily blocked from editing Wikipedia as a result of your disruptive edits.” What the heck is that supposed to mean? For restoring footnotes and links that User: AuburnPilot had vandalized? If that constitutes “disruptive edits,” then you’ve utterly given up on honest English and all human decency.

And going by the things I've read about all of you, no doubt you'll now block me from posting even on my own page. 

Either re-instate me or block the two idiots as well. No matter what, I EXPECT someone to have a talk with those two about vandalizing other people's factual information.

"""==Notability of Jeff tragedy==
A tag has been placed on Jeff tragedy, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

 Intersection of Profession, Religion and Gender on Wikipedia 

Hi BHG, I'm posting this to you because I noticed you participated in an old series of CfD discussions and are familiar with it.

In the process of reviewing the situation involving the various articles on Islamic scholarship Islamic mathematics, Islamic science, Islamic metaphysics etc.  which have been subject to extensive edit-warring and outright deletion or stubbing in the case of some articles by two groups of editors broadly labeled Islamophiles and anti-Revisionists  a third group of people who might be termed Irrelevantists as they were unfamiliar with the subject and considered it non-notable due to religious content (which the anti-revisionist history buffs do not; they merely are vehemently against anything in the article that smacked of promotion) referred folks to the old discussions that led to the deletion of the """"Professionals by religion"""" Category, e.g. CfD:Astronomers by religion and CfD:Mathematicians by religion.

The vast consensus of those two discussions were that religion was utterly irrelevant to the personal or professional life of those professionals and even asked """"when would it end?"""" Much cracks were had about how religion was once relevant to scientists' lives but is now a historical curiosity. However the discussion boiled down to it being a non-intersecting and """"frankly absurd"""" means of categorizing people.

What I find interesting is that the same policies could be provided for Category:Women by occupation and yet no one has ever proposed deletion of that entire (huge) category tree, and in fact insisted on the exact opposite arguments, despite the fact that some women actively do object to being labeled as a """"Woman scientist"""", whereas no astronomer has ever objected to being labeled religious despite the disingenuous claim made in the above CfD. 

(Caveat: The only deletion ever proposed for the gender categories that I can see is that """"Women"""" is non-grammatical, which I disagree with  it sounds better than """"Female"""" and is commonly used even in cases where it is a neologism, such as """"women earth scientists"""" - grammatical but ridiculous)  the latter is a prime case of what I'm talking about. If it had been """"Muslim earth scientists"""" or another religion, it would have been deleted """"with extreme prejudice"""" and some vitriol by """"science vs. religion"""" types. But the rationale used would have been that it was non-intersecting and an article couldn't be written about it, which seems to be being selectively applied by Brightists on this site. (Some of these categories, an article could be written but that doesn't mean a category should exist, as one person on the """"Female"""" CfD noted. Especially since the women-in-science movement is very divided about whether women professionals should be categorized as such.) 

Full disclosure: a close family member is both a woman scientist and the past president of a graduate women in science professional organization, so no bias here.   """,0.0

Probably those things comes from Kenney Mencher online lectures, filled with timeline errors. He even thinks Correggio (d. 1534) was influenced by LJ, which is bizarre.

Impumozhi and his knowledge (or lack of) about rajputs
 

Incident 1: Impumozhi accuses rajputs of fabricating history on Hada page

Read this page for a little entertainment  in particular, the last three sentences, setting out the historical repurcussions of that hilarious (and probably fictitious) incident. Is this fit for an encyclopedia? Leave aside veracity, just the choice of words? Yet nobody dare change one comma or fullstop in that page: it is """"owned"""" by that presiding deity of obduracy, the learned protagonist of every page with a remote """"rajput"""" connection.

 Impumozhi's lack of knowledge exposed

His claim about Hada's character  being funny and un-encyclopaedic is actually taken from James Tod's Annals and Antiquities page 384 and 385 Vol-II: 
On the death of the queen Joda Bae, Akbar commanded a court mourning; and that all might testify a participation in their master's affliction, an ordinance was issued that all the Rajput chiefs, as well as the Moslem leaders, should shave the moustache and the beard. To secure compliance, the royal barbers had the execution of the mandate. But when they came to  quarters of the Hadas, in order to remove these tokens of manhood, they were repulsed with buffets and contumely. Then enemies of Rao Bhoj Hada aggravated the crime of this resistance and insinuated to the royal ear that the outrage upon the barbers was accompanied with expressions insulting to memory of the departed princess, who it will be remembered was a rajputani of Marwar.  Akbar, forgetting his vassal's gallant services, commanded that Rao Bhoj should be pinioned and forcibly deprived of his moustache. He might as well have commanded the operation on a tiger. The Hadas flew to there arms, the camp was thrown into tumult, and would have soon presented a wide scene of blood-shed, had not the emperor, seasonably repenting of his folly repaired to the Boondi quarters in person. He expressed his admiration (he might have said his fear) of Hada valour, alighted from his elephant to expostulate with the Rao...

If James Tod thinks this incident is worthy of being mentioned in his book, Annals and Antiquities of Rajasthan, what is wrong in this incident being mentioned on Wikipedia?

 

Incident 2. Deleted the name of famous rajput lady, Maharani Gayatri Devi, from rajputani page, saying she is not a rajput.

His response: .

Impumozhi, on rajputani page deleted the name of Maharani Gayatri Devi . 
Then he was asked why he did so: .

His response was countered on his talk page:  and till date he has not responded. The reason he did not respond is because his lack of knowledge on the topic was thoroughly exposed.

 

Incident 3: Impumozhi tries to get the page of a famous rajput king deleted, but is thwarted.

In another incident he put a tag of db-nonsense on the article Hammir Dev Chauhan  . 
He was asked on the talk page of this article on why he put the CSD tag: . No reasons given till date. Another user, , had to remove this db-nonsense tag: . Here again Impumozhi had no idea about the subject matter but just because a rajput had created this article he put the db-nonsense tag.",0.0

Shiotani Teiko. And dozens and dozens more just like it.

Hi. You created an article saying, in full: Shiotani Teiko (塩谷定好? しおたに ていこう, 1899 - 1988) was a renowned Japanese photographer.

Actually it's Teikō, not Teiko, and according to WP's silly rules we have to ignore his real name of Shiotani Teikō and instead call him Teikō Shiotani. But that's not the main problem, which is that he's described in just about the same way as Kuribayashi Satoshi (栗林慧? くりばやし さとし, born 1939) is a renowned Japanese photographer. Or indeed Watanabe Kanendo (渡辺兼人? わたなべ かねんど, born 1947) is a renowned Japanese photographer. Or Orihara Kei (折原恵? おりはら けい, born 1948) is a renowned Japanese photographer. And so on and so on and so on. Which all means that somebody looking among Category:Japanese photographers is highly likely to land on a mere substub.

I can count on my fingers the people likely to turn a half dozen or so of these substubs into articles. No, on my thumbs: User:Pinkville and myself. But he's busy and I am too. I'd rate the probability that more than half will be converted within a year to more than stubs at well under 1%. It's an interesting """"proof of bot concept"""" exercise, but is it good for anything else? 

Tell you what: I'll match you one for one. You turn two of these into articles; I'll turn two into articles. You turn ten into articles; I'll turn ten into articles. How does that sound?   

That's a great challenge! You're on. –  (talk) (random) 

OK then. Do tell me when you've done one, as I can't keep the whole damn lot on my watchlist. Well actually I can, but I lack the time and effort to put them onto my watchlist. Also, I'll be intercoursingly busy during the next month, so in the short/medium term I may only be able to match you up to ten.

I'm sure I've got entire books by at least twenty of these substubbed people, so I ought to be able to do more.

What's odd about the list are some conspicuous absences. (Not just people I think are good, but people who, rightly or wrongly, are celebrated and successful.) Asai Shinpei is one, and there are more though I can't think of them right now. 

Not that it's any of my business, really, but did you scarf the list from User:20th Century Art (Zenhan)'s page, or do something else?   

Yeah, I scraped from Zenhan. I'll let you know here, or on your talk page, when I have one ready. I don't think I can make any of them featured, but legitimately """"non-stub"""" is the goal. All the best, –  (talk) (random) 

Okay, here's my first. Ichiki Shiro. It's not much beyond a stub, but it's something. (It took an hour of research, and I think I found all the info that's anywhere on the web regarding Mr. Ichiki.) By the way, was I right in listing him as a Hatamoto? My sources say he was a retainer of the Daimyo (in the Edo period, of course), and I know that he spoke with his Daimyo, so he couldn't have been a Gokenin. But I don't think he was a warrior, so I don't know. So far as I can tell, all Togugawa retainers were either Gokenin or Hatamoto. Am I correct in my inference? –  (talk) (random) 

Damn you're fast. 

Unfortunately I don't know squat about Tokugawa retainers and the like. On several occasions I've tried to interest myself in feudal history but have always fallen flat. I suppose I can't separate it from the hammily acted, cheesily lit TV period dramas I sometimes have to tolerate when at the in-laws'. LordAmeth might know. (And this photographer's right up Pinkville's street.)   

How's this for a progress indicator?   
Great! –  (talk) (random) 
Yup, except for a number of factors, one of which is that it's problematical copyrightwise (or so I infer from a comment elsewhere by one User:Quadell). I've already chucked in one extra list, and I'll certainly add one more, and I may add one after that; perhaps it can then be described as an original creation. All this is delaying my editing of any article. Still, I'll get around to that too in time.

"""::Well, , it's not a hoax exactly, but it's a prime example of what happens when you start out with a hypothesis and a """"worthy cause"""" and then try to find any and all evidence  that supports it (no matter how far-fetched or in the case of the current draft blatantly wrong), instead of the other way 'round. The problem is, while there are examples of androcentricity in language (although its effect on cognitive and social processes is debatable), the examples she cites are not, and she makes the rather fatal mistake of conflating grammatical gender with """"natural"""" gender and the diachronic with the synchronic analysis of language. She also seems to accept an extreme version of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis completely uncritically, although the hypothesis is never even mentioned explicitly in the draft. It's pretty clear the author has not had any formal training in linguistics (or in the languages she has attempted to analyze), and appears not to have consulted the rather vast body of academic literature on androcentric language. Or perhaps she had, but decided ignore the inconvenient conclusions? In any case, it's fairly obvious why the original version of the book was not published by an academic press, and why the revised second version is self-published.

You seem to have a completely different bar for civility depending on who the recipient is.  You took great umbrage at being told that you were using a term incorrectly, but when I pointed out that it's rude to say that your interpretation is obviously right, and anyone with a different view is flatly wrong, you went all hissy and declared I am taking """"every one of my statements as a personal attack.""""  Your attempts at logic are ridiculous.  If you want me to treat you respect, you need to give me the respect of not writing arguments that insult my intelligence.  For instance, we disagree on an issue, and that makes it a matter of opinion?  No, no it doesn't.  As for the rest, you are once again attacking a strawman.  Now, the Bible does not say what you say it says.  Therefore, the most honest thing to do would be to say in the article that this is an intepretation of the Bible.  The bare minimum is to cite a source that supports your claim that this is the consensus interpretation, rather than citing the Bible like it directly says that.

It's all done by the import companies themselves. The companies who import the material choosing to omit depictions of crucifixion for fear of censorship or backlash is not actually censorship.

"I am sure that clarity would help; if only we could agree as to what one would say. The knub of the disagreement comes in the relationship between Acts and the letters. Long arguments have already taken place between those who, supported by scholars such as Conzelman, think Acts to have a comparatively low historical value, emphasising the hostility towards Judaism expressed in Galatians, and those who regard Scripture as consistent de fide so that any one statement must be reconcilable with any other. Critical scholarship makes the second view difficult to hold, though it is represented in the article. the statement about St. Paul's prctice would be controverted on precisely these grounds by a number of editors and, more important, by scholars. It is always hard for editors to cope with the fact that we are not, as a matter of WP policy in a position to say that anything is 'indefensible. That is POV - a point of view. We can say that this learned person or that has argued in this way or that. Whne I last looked at the article it nowhere suggested that St. Paul was a Judaizer; quite the contary as Peter Ballard writes. 

In short, I fear that one person's clarity may be someone else's POV. Because we have no credibility of ourselves, we must cite someone else, someone who has some scholarly credibility.",0.0

"""Gothic Chess has the King in the center of the board with the Chancellor on 1 side and the Archbishop on the other. This is a very important difference. The piece distribution is smooth. There is 1 new pieces to the left of the king, 1 new piece to the right of the king, and the other chess material is where it belongs.  In Embassy, having the east-west mirror you mentioned makes a big difference also. The game is played """"upside down"""", as the east-west mirror is reversing the color of your pieces. Clearly in chess you remember this is the case. Black is the east-west mirror of white. So, Embassy Chess has white playing as black on the queenside, and the lopsided distribution on the kingside.

Hi , the new section title sounds good to me, but I'm still in favor of removing the Charles Taylor quote.  It makes Mr. Taylor appear like a living legend, which perhaps he is, but it's odd that he's not referred to in such glowing terms on his own Wikipedia article (or maybe not: it's a very contentious statement from a periodical, not a person).  The second part of the quote seems like empty praise to me, not really encyclopedia grade material.  Neither part passes the sniff test, so I removed it again.

Also, from your comment, it appears that you think the article is unbalanced because positive material is not being included.  Is that what you think, that there is not enough positive material about Mr. Wilber in the article?  I thought the whole goal was NPOV, neither positive nor negative, just the facts. It's not supposed to sound like an ad, nor like an attack piece, and to that end, both this quote and negative quotes like """"Mr. Wilber is full of himself"""" will get stricken.

"I agree with you. I am a Chinese contributor to this site and I speak 3 Chinese vernaculars and 3 European languages and through some of the unreasonable Mandarinization imposed here, I feel how repressed non-native Mandarin speakers are by those apparently native speakers. Traditionally, foreign names are transliterated into Chinese ideographs by whichever vernacular group that first settled there. In USA and Europe, it is mostly by the Cantonese, then subsequently The Minnan-Taiwanese and recently the people for Fuzhou, Wenzhou etc. As such, they will use Han ideographs to represent the sounds they transliterate from the foreign language like English. There is no standardised version until the Northerners came into power and imposed Mandarin on all the other Chinese groups for the noble mission of reuniting the motherland against foreign invaders through bettering communication. I think the best way to transliterate and reflect the diversity of Chinese culture is to put the actual foreign name first, i.e. the ORIGINAL, followed by the oldest transliteration (in chronology) and finally the Mandarin version. That will make it easy for everyone cos then the eyes will zoom right to the end for the contemporary Mandarin pronunciation and zoom right to the first line for the original and if readers have time, they can trace the colorful history of transliteration and migration by reading the chronology of changes. Thank you for being so interested in Chinese culture. We need more friends like you. Have a nice day.",0.0

JP, thank you for finally explaining what your problem is. Of course what Jackson said is relevant. This is an article on Jesse Jackson. If Jackson puts his foot in his mouth, it is relevant. A cited statement does not violate NPOV. I learned that fact the hard way when I tried to edit cited statements out of the article on Michael Savage. As far as whether or not Jackson contradicted himself, are you denying that Jackson used to be for interracial marriage? Do you want me to cite a source saying that he used to be for interracial marriage? Liberals like Jackson have always referred to conservative whites from the south who opposed interracial marriage as """"racists."""" Evidently, it's """"in"""" for a minority to be against interracial marriage, though. Or maybe it's that white men can't have black women, but black men can have white women with Jesse. It's pretty obvious to me that if Jackson is now saying that it's """"illegal"""" for a white man to fantasize about a black woman (What the hell does he mean by this? It's perfectly legal to fantasize. What an idiot!), then he is obviously against white men dating black women. He wants """"whitey"""" to keep his hands off black """"property."""" Perhaps Jackson needs a translator, since he frequently says things that make no sense. Do you know what Jackson meant? I honestly don't see any violation. Please elaborate further, and we can work out a compromise. However, I will get the statement in the article. Liberals who hate Michael Savage have a bunch of negative quotes about him in his article, so I think that it's fair for a conservative like me to get in negative quotes about Mr. Jackson, as long as the quotes are cited by a reputable source.

 Point of view terms used in the Scott article 

In the modern reaction it is said: 

""""Scott's reputation survived the period after World War II, beyond the 50th anniversary of his death.""""

This is rather obvious Point-of-view-terminology. Saying something has survived only until a certain point in time basically means it's dead. Captain Scott's reputation is far from dead, so this is not a true representation of reality.

A correct encyclopedic term would be:

""""Scott's high reputation remained uncontested until the period after World War II, beyond the 50th anniversary of his death.""""

Another problem is that it is spoken of a timeframe beyond World War II, but the first book that is mentioned offering criticism in the next sentence is from 1966. Here we have a difference of more than 20 years that are claimed to belong to the time that Scott's high reputation had been contested, while in reality they belong to the uncontested period. Consequently, this is another passage that needs further rectifying clarfification.  """,0.0

Thanks for your helpful comments. I would suggest one of my own for you: use proper capitalization and punctuation when making comments on Wikipedia.
You are correct, I would not argue that """"the widespread possesion (sp) and use of guns is FOREIGN to puerto rican (sp) culture"""" - but I also would NOT argue that it is common in """"American"""" culture - by any definition of """"American"""" culture. (What do you mean by """"American"""" culture? a culture shared by all nations of the Western Hemisphere? that shared by the USA, including its insular territories? that shared by the mainland USA alone?) I have never possessed or used a gun, nor do I personally know anyone who has. Thus I should be culturally identical to my fellow U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico, in this regard. I'm not sure what you are trying to suggest with this example, but it is straightforward to claim that the English language is a part of the culture of the United States, because its use is pervasive throughout the country; but it is something altogether different to suggest that the possession and use of firearms is a part of the U.S. cultural identity - there is wide variation in attitudes toward this supposed """"cultural trait"""" from person to person, from region to region, and yes, from state or territory to state or territory.

"Now even the discussion attempts to further contextualize and diminish the Red Army's crimes!  The Red Army's crimes remain crimes - there is always a context and a reason for any crime committed by anyone.  What Wehrmacht or SS soldiers did or did not do in no way justifies or sufficiently contextualizes-away rapes committed against women aged 8 (and lower) to 80+. Unfortunately that is what this article in its present form attempts to do. On top of that, this article about rape gives no voice to the raped and only offers voices of the perpetrators that dismiss the accusations.  It's rather perverse, misogynistic, and revisionist.  A more appropriate, balanced, and meaningful way to tackle this topic would be to give a straight-forward account of the wide-spread rapes/violence by the Red Army, including accounts from various Nazi|women/victims.  After that, background/context should be given to help understand why this happened, but never in a way that implies that crimes do not remain crimes.  In addition, a section on Soviet/Russian ways of interpreting/handling on the violence/rapes would be informative as well.  In its current form, this article does Wikipedia a disservice and is yet another example of a biased and amateurish account of history that cements Wikipedia's reputation as an unreliable source of information.  It is only by tackling these types of issues effectively that the Wikipedia community can prove it can be a viable source of information.  

Re:  profoundly a-historical suggestion.

Contextualizing the supposed crimes, as claimed by Udibi, is not the same thing as diminishing those acts of punishment inflicted on the Nazis for murdering 20,000,000 people.  I find his reference to SS Paramilitary as soldiers to be deeply disturbing, a-historical, ill-informed, and suspicious, as SS Paramilitaries were not soldiers and were not even part of the military.  While Nazi acts of genocide do not in themselves justify rape, they make it very understandable why people who assisted in the worst mass murder in history were punished by the surviving victims.  Related, the Nazis were very popular and had massive support from the population, who in turn offered no resistance to the Nazi regime; he who keeps silent consents; these women were therefore active supporters of the Holocaust.  It would not have been difficult for them to fight against the Nazis in some way, and they should not receive sympathy for not doing so and allowing 20,000,000 people to be murdered.  I really see no problem of revisionism here.  I recommend that other editors be very wary of this proposal to create a self proclaimed more appropriate, balanced, and meaningful way to tackle this topic as it may lead us to perpetuating the moral equivalency arguments of covert Holocaust deniers.

I think we also need to consider whether this is not just a case of hundreds of thousands of German women getting lucky with their liberators (a view shared by many Germans, described in The Fall of Berlin 1945) and then telling local Nazi leaders or Werewolf members that they were raped, in a regime where they could not openly have any sort of relationship with Russians.

"""Pseudoscience Category ==

I feel strongly that this article should be moved away from the pseudoscience category, as it does fulfill any of WIkipedia's requirements of pseudoscience. Wikipedia states:

Other things usually should not be called pseudoscience on Wikipedia:

Alternative theoretical formulations: Alternative theoretical formulations from within the scientific community, such as Modified Newtonian Dynamics as opposed to dark matter, are not pseudoscience, but part of the scientific process. Such theoretical formulations may fail to explain some aspect of reality, but, should they succeed in doing so, will usually be rapidly accepted. For instance, the theory of continental drift had quite a lot of evidence, but was heavily criticised because there was no known mechanism for continents to move, and thus such evidence was dismissed. When such a mechanism was discovered, it became mainstream as plate tectonics.

To determine whether something falls into the category of pseudoscience or merely an alternative theoretical formulation, consider this: Alternative theoretical formulations generally tweak things on the frontiers of science, or deal with strong, puzzling evidence which it is difficult to explain away, in an effort to create a model that better explains reality. Pseudoscience generally proposes changes in basic scientific laws or reality in order to allow some phenomenon which the supporters want to believe occurs, but lack the strong scientific evidence that would justify such major changes. Pseudoscience usually relies mainly on weak evidence, such as anecdotal evidence or weak statistical evidence at just above the level of detection, though it may have a few papers with positive results, for example: parapsychology and homeopathy.

""""AIDS denialists"""" are not proposing a new form of science based on non-scientific methods, they are merely disputing that the claims that other scientists make, and these disputes arise ENTIRELY from science. In fact, """"AIDS denialists"""" claim that MAINSTREAM scientists are not using science correctly. In fact, all they are doing is asking for scientific proof of what the mainstream scientific community insists exists but can't verify.

Dear Q, I know all this. My main concern was to change the dead wikilink into one that linked to Albert. I know that his title was King of the Romans but I think it is common WP pratice to use the term """"King of Germany"""" for that respective office to avoid confusion. Also, to say that there was no Germany at that time is wrong - there was a German Kingdom that was part (in fact the primary part of the Holy Roman Empire. And Albert was King of that Kingdom. I hope you understand.  (smile back) 

I rather disagree with you, but in a friendly way (I hate edit-war nonsense). I think it's possible to create links without necessarily making page titles—and there really are some atrocious ones about ('Ladislas the Posthumous' being one of them, in my opinion)—appear on the page in question. 

It is certainly possible and reasonable to call Albert """"King of the Germans"""" or """"German King"""" (the Germans themselves use the term """"Römisch-deutscher König"""", which covers it nicely. But even here on English Wikipedia, where there are many mistakes in this matter, the term """"King of Germany"""" is rarely used. Of course there was a Germany at that time in the sense of a German-speaking volk,  but there was not a German kingdom in the sense of a political state ruled by a royal government (when a later King of the Romans, Ferdinand I, tried to administer Hungary and Bohemia from Vienna, he was rebuffed— and he wouldn't have even tried that much in principalities where he was not the dynastic prince, such as Saxony or Brandenburg); the nearest thing to a German kindom, the Carolingian kingdom of the East Franks (even that has been called the Kingdom of Germany only as a back-formation), had fragmented fairly quickly into a group of states with their own princes (in the case of Bohemia, an actual king). Albert II is an interesting case because in his purely German-speaking territories he was only a duke. His kingdoms of Bohemia and Hungary, though part of the Holy Roman Empire, were largely non-German, which is another reason why Rex Romanorum is correct and not """"King of Germany"""".

The English Wikipedia article on the subject is very inaccurate, announcing the academically unjustifiable decision to use the term """"Kingdom of Germany"""" for clarification's sake. In my opinion, having had this stuff drummed into me at university, where I had to read texts in Latin and German, that doesn't so much clarify as blur the issue. The title """"King of the Romans"""" may be difficult, and so may the idea of a group of independent German (and non-German) states within the Holy Roman Empire, but the readers of Wikipedia, in my opinion, shouldn't have history revised for them to make it fit the modern world (and Austria still isn't the same country as Germany anyway). Fortunately, the  articles on this subject on German Wikipedia use the correct terminology. """,0.0

 BCN-SIA discussion 

First, sorry because my poor english.

Hi, i don't want to start a undo-war or something like that, but the avionews post is only a rumour. It's a propaganda speech from a Milan SEA not a declaration of any SIA officer.

I've talked with the SIA spanish comercial manager and he says me that the italian SIA officers inmediatly deny that issue, nor the SIA-BCN cancellation, nor the FCO-MXP flights traspassing... and all is a simply propaganda from Milan in this moments of crisis. This was also confirmed by SIA London regional headquarters...

Unfortunately, I haven't found any italy/UK SIA press relase dennying the Milan SEA president affirmations but i think that informations that I have are enough to question the avionews article.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

Because of that, I have """"twicked"""" the comment from """"until summer 2009"""" to """"probably until summer 2009, in which they could codeshare with other Star Alliance partners""""

This means that Wikipedias are not even admins' private websites and that to revert other editors' distributions unreasonably is not helpful and not preferable at all.

 The fifth pillar of WP:5P says, """"Wikipedia does not have firm rules"""". Please explain why you can have been saying and doing the contrary.
 Please explain why you can ignore all of WP:5P?
 Please explain why you can delete the most important lead which explains from its original meanings. The important lead that you deleted unreasonably is below: """"Harmonic is originally an adjective relating to the combination of musical notes to create chords, later, becomes a noun meaning a soft high note played on a stringed instrument by not pressing the string all the way down"""". 
 Please explain why you can leave the unsourced OR sentence while unfairly accusing me of """"unsourced OR"""". The OR lead you have left is below: """"usually refers to the frequency components of a time-varying signa"""".  
 Please explain why you can express(lie) """"restore"""", though in fact you """"ruin""""ed the lead apparently.

OK, the Catholicism tag is part of the Christianity tag because of my trying to integrate all of them. The question of the Vatican City, Rome, and Italy is a good one. I can see having one """"Italy"""" tag with a drop-down for Rome and maybe another for Vatican City, and personally think that would probably be the way to go. Unfortunately, my machine got stolen last night which is likely going to seriously damage my own ability to combine those banners. I don't think this machine even has the tildes to do a signature, so I'm going to have to tell you by hand that this is John Carter. What you might consider doing is asking the Rome project to become a subproject of Italy, or, if it is inactive, just merge the banners yourself. As more or less the only active Vatican member, I don't think that there would be any objections to merging it into the Italy banner either. John Carter""",0.0

"2014 (UTC)
 I object to this. It's not a calendar year that the competition runs in, but a football season. While it will be done before the end of 2014, it still takes place within the 2014/15 football season (as shown on the info box below), and when the next season edition (and so on) takes place with a January final, will create an odd situation where there is a 2014 FFA Cup article, then 2015/16, and ongoing 20xx/xx article titles. It is better to standardise them now to a full seasonal date. There is also the possibility that a shift in competition dates over multiple seasons could see a competition run entirely in the first half of the year, followed by another edition of the tournament that starts and finishes in the second half of the year, which would lead to a very odd title situation if we go by a 'calendar year' article title process, eg we could end up with a hypothetical situation of having to disambiguate two editions of the tournament played in the same calendar year despite being in different football seasons.   09:14, 15 May",0.0

1. What motivates you to edit the UCR article?

3. Some have accused you of having a bias, or not being fair. Then again, many of the editors who hope to make the article positive, have a conflict of interest considering they attend the school. What is your opinion on all of this? How would you respond to people's criticism?

4. If you could make any major change to the article or to the editing process, what would it be?

5. Lastly, how do you feel about UC Riverside. Is it overrated and underperforming? Thoughts.

I really appreciate you answering these questions. We have contacted people from both camps, and hopefully we can produce an article that fairly represents everyone.

You are missing the point. The phrase you quote is in a summary of other scholars' arguments. When summarizing the view of a sub-group we are not supposed to render our opinion on whether their arguments are valid. Nor do we decide whether to include their views on the basis of whether their views are consistent with wikipedia editorial policy. If a substantial minority of scholars argued that Julius Caesar's astrological chart ought to be considered historical evidence, it would be incumbent upon wikipedia to report that in the relevant article. An absurd example, but I hope it illustrates how you are missing the point. Furthermore, as for the scholars' argument itself, they are not arguing against """"methodological naturalism"""" or history as an """"empirical science."""" In fact, many evangelicals offer mounds of evidence (convincing or otherwise) for their views (including single authorship of Isaiah) that adhere to methodological naturalism and empirical science. See Kenneth Kitchen's On the Reliability of the Old Testament (Eerdmans, 2003) for the most significant example. Rather, by """"outmoded modernist presuppositions,"""" evangelicals typically refer to practices and assumptions of source critics that are even now recognized as obsolete by secular scholars. For instance, the assumptions held by former adherents of the documentary hypothesis are now rejected, leading to Neo-Documentary Hypothesis proponents (e.g., Jeffery Stackert at University of Chicago) that rely less on such outdated methods and assumptions. 70.131.155.15

 Sound media in Bach article 

Hello Michael Bednarek, I've just seen you have reverted the inclusion of sound media samples in the article. I understand that, being in a block, it did interfere with the article layout. However, I invite you to reconsider some kind of media inclusion ( it can be in smaller one sample blocks): notice that this is an article about a musical genius, which gave space to every picture of Bach and family. Although a lot of people know exactly how Bach sounds, its music is the issue here, and it would also be kind for the not so much """"connoisseurs"""" - or not so interested in digging it -to be able to hear it there.

Re: Hughes.  Yes, I think you're right that they were no longer lovers at that time.  But you didn't change """"was her lover"""" to """"had been her lover,"""" you just deleted the entire paragraph, which I dispute.  Instead, I propose:  With the help of Howard Hughes, who at one time had been her lover, she purchased the rights to the play and turned it into a hit movie.  The movie was very important to her career and it's an interesting and pertinent detail that Hughes was so involved in helping her make it a reality.  I certainly don't want to perpetuate errors, but let's talk about how to fix them instead of just deleting information wholesale.

Re: Hepburn and Tracy's living situation  what would you suggest instead?  How about something like... Hepburn and Tracy were undeniably a couple, but only lived together regularly until the last few years of Tracy's life. Even then, they maintained separate homes to keep up appearances.

Re the Hughes/Hepburn engagement  I believe there was a NYT article that announced their engagement, or announced that it was off, but I haven't had time yet to find it.

Re Hepburn and Smith's marriage, from Higham:  The marriage was a disaster. Kate had such a horror of domesticity that the whole experience was a nightmare. She evidently realized that she had married on a whim and that marriage was totally incompatible with her need for absolute freedom of thought and action.  Three weeks after the marriage took place, the couple separated.  Faced with the fact that he had a failed marriage, Luddy sensibly decided to continue with Kate on a platonic basis.  She remained legally married to him for several years.  Do you have something that refutes this?  I'd be glad to source it specifically to Higham in the text of the article if you like.

Also like I said before, my site has been up since 1997 off a different domain, and since 1999 off the current domain. We are ranked 5 on google, and get plenty of hits on our own, I was not trying to add my site here to receive more hits. PureGraffiti.com is going to be online for as long as the internet is alive, the gallery will be the biggest gallery of graffiti art online, weather one agrees with me or not, you can take a look at the stats and figure it out yourself. We are online for Graffiti Artists that dont have the knowledge or money to get their pictures up on a website that is already established and well known by almost everyone in the USA that is a Graffiti Artist. The store we have merely pays for the dedicated server bill costs to keep this huge site alive, and there are 500 other stores online that do advertize on google and other sites, we on the other hand dont. We also dont charge for the webspace, and we also dont have advertizing for money on our site in hopes to make money of our viewers like many of the sites you have accepted.

Please take all this into consideration:

http://www.Artcimes.org = first graffiti site. They have a store as well, and they have advertizing for money all through-out their site. Just because they are the first graffiti site, doesnt give them any special treatment. 
http://www.bombing.org = Advertizing for money all over the site
http://writers.org.ua = advertizing for money pop-up when visited the site.

P.S. By no means I have a problem with these sites, however, I do think it is unfair that they get to be on there when my site is the same, and does not contain advertizements to make money.

I made several other changes, which you can view in the history. I'm sure you'll want to add more information from these two references, and maybe from other references as well.

"Honestly the way wiki is treating this is a JOKE

a. I could have cited NEWS SITES but since when is a news site worthy of an academic cite?

b. if the person that wanted PEER REVIEW felt like it, he would have sought it 20 years ago, HE CHOSE NOT TO DO IT, but none the less his work is known and was mentioned in many math related 'forums' and most ignored it. 

c. Only the recent 2012 open source test of the work PROVED the 30Mod algorithm is a major thing in math, again, GITHUB is a programmers resource and it was not until a computer used the actual 30Mod algorithm that it was shown to be a 'big thing' and since then some news sites have covered it, but I chose not to cite them due to IMO they are not NPOV. But none the less they covered the story.

d. The FACT is a major computer site where programmers have free reign to challenge any claims exists and for over two years not one programmer challenged the findings.

e. so what if the person that discovered it works outside of academia and has no regard for normal 'peer review' the fact is he has no peers if you ask some in academia that know of his work, and I am one of those people that know of the work and how brilliant the work is.

Now to summarize, we have a bunch of pags about primes on wiki, and even pages created after his discovery that USE his discovery (ie. the sieve of Atkin 60Mod work is his work discussed in the public forum and usenet math and physics forums is where he chose to discuss his amazing work.

So now you have 2004 sieve of Atkin using a 60Mod algorithm, guess what that was in his 1995 paper. So does wiki acknowledge that? No. And i didn't even bother to waste my time of the 60 mod algorithm since the big deal as you are saying is the PyPrimes test and I cited that very well, it's a program created in Python, I cited the wiki python page, then I cited Github for both PyPrimes and the PyPrimes testing.

Now while MATH is m forte, I am sufficient enough in computer skills to understand what Github is and to understand how to read the speed tests and the prime spirals smoked every algorithm there is. Now anyone can download python (which I have done) and download pyprimes (which I have done) and run the tests. Guess what just like a math experiment, it is duplicated.

So GITHUB and the tests which are not 'new' should be enough to begin a wiki page on this truly amazing discovery in math.

I myself became aware of the first paper in 1995, as did others in aademia. Recently I became aware of 'news sites' running stories citing what I copied, the links to the Github tests.

While some here can say well it's not AMA, so what, in the world of primality testing primes spirals as per the PyPrimes results shows PRIME SPIRALS are a big deal.

Now I tried to be NPOV in giving all sides of the story, Adoni has a valid 1995 claim I can verify it and I chose not to. But I cited a Drexel Math forum and I could have cited many other math sites discussing his 30mod, 60mod and 90mod prime work in the 1990's. Is this signficant? You bet it is since 60Mod prime sieve aka Atkin sieve is 20004 so his 60mod prime work is well before it.

Now the Github tests mentions 'croft spirals', that's due to in 2010 a person named croft registering a web site and ripping off the 1995 work. MY OPINION.

Now Croft can say all he wants that he found it playng his guitar or whatever he is claiming.

The fact is anyone can document Adoni with Prime theory from the 1990's saying 30mod, 60mod and 90mod is the key.

9 Years later sieve of atkin appears, well that's only a rehash of the adoni 60mod work from the 1990's. Yet no one is giving him credit.

2010 croft puts out his 30Mod work and its inserted into PyPrimes on Github and it smokes every major prime algorithm there is and all of them have pages on wiki as I cited.

So 2012 a work on Github verifies how important to primality the 30mod spirals are, but he says croft spirals, well guess what HelixQ is now out there and taking 100% credit for the 1995 work of Dr. Adoni.

My site to a Drexel math site from the 1990's mentioning 30Mod prime work (prime spirals) is a major cite, since Adoni could care less about the AMA or whatever, in all probability he will soon be nominated for a Nobel on his work, that is how important it is. 

Think about it, not one prime algorithm could beat the ancient sieve of Eratosthenes, none of them. On a computer creating primes all other algorithms are terribly slow. The only two fast generators from scratch are the ancient sieve of Eratosthenes and the PRIME SPIRALS, and the winner was Prime Spirals. Now I can cite recent news articles about it, laughing at academics it links to that said it was no big deal in the 1990's who now all look foolish due",0.14285714285714285

Response Interestingly, although scienceopologist has admittedly never """"read and understood"""" what Langan says about particular subjects related to the CTMU (since he sees no reason for it), he nevertheless presumes to include his irrelevant personal opinions about what Langan believes about particular subjects related to the CTMU. As anyone familiar with the controversy is well aware, no ID proponent has a theory identical or even similar to evolutionist Langan's. (If one does, we'd need verification for that, preferably by some one who has actually read Langan's work.)

This is part of the Ron Paul interview with Glenn Beck.
BECK: OK. Dr. Paul, I`m going to take a break. And in the break, I`m going to feed something down to your location that I`m not going to show on the air. My life has been threatened. I`ve had to wear a vest and have securities. I`ve had an S.W.A.T. team watch my family because of people who say they support you. I want to show you something that is out on the Internet about me and from people that say they support you. And I want to get your thoughts on this, and let`s set to rest some things when we come back. Shall we? 

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BECK: We`re back with Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul, who is joining us tonight for a full hour. I want to make this very clear. I believe that Ron Paul, in general, the group of supporters, some of whom I`ve met while I was on the road, are amazing people. Without any help from the official campaign, Ron Paul supporters have coined the term """"The Ron Paul Revolution."""" They developed the concept for the Guy Fawkes Day money bomb back on November 5th which raised over $4 million. They hired a blimp to fly over New Hampshire to promote the Ron Paul campaign. Last Sunday, they held a tea party, where they broke John Kerry`s single day primary fundraising record by collecting another $6 million. But the downside is, when you have rabid supporters, some of them believe they can speak to their own agendas using the candidate`s name. And I just in the break showed Dr. Paul just a clip, a very small part of a five- minute video that is on the Internet where I am named a traitor and traitors should be executed. Can you  would you like to address that at all, sir?

 Peer Review Suggestion 

This article fails to make the rational connection between the date in 2012 and it's source in authentic Maya works. The date comes from a disputed correlation (GMT 584283) between the modern theory, by Mayanists, of a reconstructed ancient """"long-count"""" and the modern Gregorian calendar. The modern """"theory"""" of a """"long-count"""" was mostly derived in the late 1880's from one of three surviving Maya codices, namely the Dresden Codex. There are at least six direct astronomical statements about the 2012 time period in the Dresden codex. None of these are even remotely suggested by this article.

 Reverting for no reason 

I spent quite some time improving an article that was in a poor state.  Now two people have undone all my work with a click of a button.  You didn't have the courtesy to explain why you reverted it, but you still had the fucking cheek to accuse me of leaving an inaccurate edit summary.  No-one's that stupid so you were plainly just out to provoke me.  Well fucking well done, consider me fucking provoked.  I guess you didn't even bother to look at the changes before you put all that shit back.

But you're predicating the above on a false assumption, one I said was one of the things you're accusing me of: that fact is I have dealt with the issues Jdchamp raised, and done so in the proper forums, and intend to continue if I ever see a constructive argument come his way. The only extent to which I haven't has been me trying to do exactly the same """"Step back and take a deep breath"""" since Monday thing that you're now arguing I should do. I honestly started to wonder if this was my imagination, so I just checked, I've even had a healthy discussion on the """"poll"""" area with Strunke, one in which Jdchamp would have been welcome to join in had he had more to say than the """"I demand administrator intervention"""", """"You two are working together"""", type accusations he's been making. (Not that I would have stopped him, but the point is that seems to be the level of discussion.)

I'm not going to pretend there aren't comments I made very early on that were unhelpful (though any reasonable person would have seen them for what they were, how was I to know what I was dealing with?) But nothing I have done rose to the level that your insults against me suggested, and absolutely nothing at all, nothing, period, rose to the level that I deserved to have my page vandalized every day with bogus warnings and pseudo-make-ups.

You know, I've been on Wikipedia now for, well, I guess well over a year now. I've never had anything like this happen to me. I've had """"robust"""" discussions before. I have never, ever, had a situation where someone was so obsessed with a technical detail that they decided to come to my Talk: page and post warnings over, and over, and over, and over again, or refused to post in the correct place when asked. Perhaps you regularly deal with worse people than that, I don't know. But I didn't deserve this. I reverted something that, at the time, was against consensus, and I did it a grand total of twice. I explained my reasons. The nearest thing I did at the time that came to being uncivil was pointing out that deliberately making changes against consensus can be seen by many of us as vandalism.

 False inormation in the article 
As you would expect, the propagandists would say and do everything to mislead us. They once again proved themselfs to be the proven LIARS we alreayd knew they were since the article wrongly states that the darker picture with the """"fall-off"""" effects is the edited one, which is pure BS.

The original photo is the one with the """"fall-off"""" effect which was printed in The West Australian already back in august 2, 1969 (~6 min in this clip http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMuTiziCszU) while the lighten up picture is the EDITED version who came out much later. So unless the propaganda trolls cant find a version of THEIR claimed original version dated EARLIER than august second 1969, i suggest them to SHUTUP.

 The Buzz Alrdin photo is explained at Examination_of_Apollo_Moon_photographs#Issues with crosshairs in photos.   You talkin' to me? 

The video shows a guy holding up the actual newspaper from 2 aug 1969 to prove that the """"fall-off"""" picture is how the original one looked like, but then its youtube who isnt a reliable source!?  your desperate try for making a point is laughable... but i wouldnt expect more from a propaganda TROLL.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 91.145.38.53   

 No, that newspaper doesn't show what the original one looks like.  The original is a transparency that is in NASA's vaults.  They made prints that were widely reprinted. See this for more information.  You talkin' to me? 

Bullshit! excuses from NASA wont make it true! you have the history of that picture in the video i linked to and even the NASA site you linked to shows the fact that the darker picture is the first one, the original from 1969, while the more lighten edited version came out 1975. So why you arguing? you dont have a chance here. As i said, BRING UP a picture dated earlier than 2 aug 1969 or SHUTUP - its that simple!

91.145.38.53, please stop insulting other editors and please sign your posts, just put four tildes at the end .   

I dont tolerating having my talk session closed, this is what the propagandists do? censoring their opponents!
Unless the propagandists cant bring up the picture THEY claim to be the original together with a date which needs to be earlier than second of august 1969, i will change the article. False misleading information should never be tolerated! Its already proven that the """"fall-off"""" darker version IS the original. If anyone wants to argue, then bring up! 91.145.38.53

What I appreciate about this discussion, is that it is being conducted by people who demonstrate a great deal of concern for the issues involved - both the subtleties and the sweep of the issue. I believe this is appropriate (though admittedly tiring) because, in legal matters, a great deal often hinges on a comma, or the inclusion/exclusion of the word """"not,"""" or other such maddening technicalities. Ergo Shakespeare's famous dictum about lawyers.

Consejo de Salud Playa de Ponce v. Rullan does provide federal precedent, and a framework for discussion and debate. However the Rullan ruling is not ultimately dispositive of a U.S. constitutional question or territorial status issue, since the U.S. Supreme Court is the court of ultimate (and binding) jurisdiction in both of these areas.

The language of the Rullan ruling did not grant full constitutional privileges to Puerto Ricans living on the island itself (as opposed to those living on the mainland). The Rullan court stated that """"Congress today, thus, must afford Puerto Rico and the 4,000,000 United States citizens residing therein all constitutional guarantees.""""

However, as stated earlier, Puerto Rico is subject to the U.S. Congress' plenary powers under the territorial clause of Article IV, sec. 3, of the U.S. Constitution.U.S. Const. art. IV, § 3, cl. 2 (""""The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States ...""""). 

The Rullan ruling occurred in 2008. Three years later (in 2011), insular Puerto Ricans have neither U.S. Congresspersons nor U.S. Senators, and they cannot vote for a U.S. president. Therefore insular Puerto Ricans are not fully-enfranchised U.S. citizens, and they have not been extended """"enjoyment of all rights and obligations under the U.S. Constitution.""""

It is thus clear that (in the exercise of its plenary powers) the U.S. Congress has chosen to ignore the Rullan ruling.
 
The operative word in this discussion (and I understand the frustration on both sides) is the usage of the word """"must"""" in the Rullan ruling. As forceful as that word sounds, it was mis-used by the Rullan court, because the U.S. Congress clearly ignored it.  

Again...a lower federal court is not the court of ultimate jurisdiction for the issues addressed by Rullan. The U.S. Congress ignored it. Puerto Ricans (on the island) are not fully-enfranchised, and therefore do not have """"enjoyment of all rights and obligations under the U.S. Constitution.""""

Dear C.Fred, this is ridiculous. I'm just conveying a fact, and Wikipedia is blocking me as soon as I do. I'm like the boy that states the fact that the emperor is naked, and you're among the public that tells him to be quiet. Can you please tell me what I possibly can write about clades and cladistics that will not block me? Anything that isn't right on the point? Cladistic is is in fact a mental desease. Is it possible to say that a mental desease is a mental desease? At the same time as Object-Oriented modeling is making great progress in geographical information systems (like you can see on CNN almost every night illustrating statistics for US and parts of it) and in a multitude of other applications, the inconsistent, self-contradictory and empirically erroneous cladism holds its fort against it by oppression of its opponents (for example blocking me). I have supported my statements with facts, and none of the influential cladists even dare to challenge them. Gareth Nelson tried every night for at least five months without success. The fact that he even tried is a measure of the importance he assesses them. In this continuing blocking of me, Wikipedia at least has to set a time limit as to when it regards the facts I'm stating (i.e., that time is relative) as being generally accepted (among cladists?). This discussion is totally and utterly ridiculous. Cladism does in fact deny that time can be relative, instead claiming that it is relations that are are relative, that is, that relative is relative. How long do we have to continue discussing a paranoia? Why not just conclude that it is a paranoia? Cladists don't understand that it is they that conceptualize reality, but instead think they find concepts. They think things have conceptual labels all around them, that they are branded. It is ridiculous, ridiculous... 

I thus contest being blocked for telling the truth. I argue that if telling the truth in itself is a reason for being blocked, then Wikipedia can certainly not be allocated to the category 'encyclopedia', since the definition of this concept surely must include telling the truth (to the best of its ability). If Wikipedia contest this argument, then I demand a specification of which part(s) of it. (I, however, have no illusions. I expect this contest to lead to my blocking from this page too. I expect to be blocked everytime I tell the truth. It doesn't stop me. I will continue telling the truth until it penetrates cladists foggy brains, or at least diagnoses their foggy brains as the foggy brains they are. In the meantime, Wikipedia will have major problems trying to hinder their confusion to spread to phylogenetics, evolution, medicine and maybe even science itself. Cladism actually hates science in its traditional form, i.e., as described by Karl Popper, and is presently trying to roll out its confusional mat over it. Just read the """"explanation"""" of phylogenetics and you have to understand what I mean. It is totally impossible to make """"heads and tails"""" of. If it belongs in an encyclopedia, then I'm Santa, Cladism is not science, but rather a reaction against science). Consist (presently at 83.254.20.53  )""",0.0

 Perspective? 
""""In the trial Shylock represents the Jewish side in contrast to the Christian one in a matter of highest importance: Justice (Jewish, Old Testament) is confronted with Mercy (Christian, New Testament). In the Christian view mercy is the decisive step after justice is reached. Therefore the Christians in the courtroom urge mercy. Beside the fact, that Shylock as a Jew is not in duty to give mercy, he is not able as well, because for this you need love. He doesn't find love at all, but hate. Shakespeare explains this in Shylock's monologue very clearly. To be merciful despite the hate nevertheless you have to love your enemy (New Testament). That means in fact that the Christians in the courtroom urge Shylock to behave like a very true Christian by loving his enemies although they themselves failed even in loving just their neighbours (the Jews) in the past before.""""

Wikipedia sued for ‘aiding neo-Nazis’
December 7, 2007 - 11:14AM

A left-wing German politician has filed charges against online encyclopaedia Wikipedia for promoting the use of banned Nazi symbols in Germany.

Katina Schubert, a deputy leader of the Left party, said she had filed the charge with Berlin police on the grounds that Wikipedia’s German language site contained too much Nazi symbolism, particularly an article on the Hitler Youth movement.

“The extent and frequency of the symbols on it goes beyond what is needed for documentation and political education, in my view,” she told Reuters. “This isn’t about restricting freedom of opinion, it’s about examining what the limits are.”

Schubert said she had taken legal advice before making her move, and that she hoped it would encourage public debate on how far internet platforms should be allowed to aid proponents of extremist, anti-semitic and racist ideologies.

“There are signs neo-Nazis are trying to take advantage of such structures, and this needs to be stopped in good time,” Schubert said. “Especially given that Wikipedia is too important to jeopardise as an open and self-regulating project.”

A spokesman for Wikimedia Deutschland, an organisation that promotes the internet lexicon in Germany, rejected the charge.

“We don’t really know what Ms Schubert’s problem is,” Arne Klempert, managing director of Wikimedia Deutschland, told Reuters. “What’s important is the context the symbols are used in, and here it’s quite clearly education and documentation.”

“Anyone who tries to prevent the Nazi period being documented properly has a strange understanding of the world, in my view,” Klempert said. “Because that’s the best weapon there is (to prevent) something like that from happening again.”

Public display of Nazi symbols is illegal in Germany, but they can be used for educational and artistic purposes.

Schubert also came under fire from party colleagues.

“Katina Schubert fails to grasp the self-regulating mechanisms that work in Wikipedia,” Heiko Hilker, a Left party media expert in Saxony’s state parliament, said in a statement.

“Right-wing extremism on the World Wide Web cannot be tackled via national criminal proceedings,” he added.

Schubert said police would pass on the charge to state prosecutors, who would decide whether to open an investigation.

Klempert said Wikipedia’s structure, which enables internet users to discuss and edit content, ensured no bias arose. “Particularly on subjects like the Hitler Youth, you can be sure it would be changed in seconds if it did (show bias),” he said.

The Hitler Youth was the Nazis’ official youth organisation.

"""I think that, at the level of basic fundamental principles, we may actually be in agreement. I would agree that it's inappropriate for Editor """"A"""" to insert a format that Editor """"A""""  ‘’knows’’ is non-standard,  and then request a consensus before it's overturned by Editor """"B"""" as soon after the posting as is reasonably practicable,” or at least provide some explanation for using this non-standard format. 

We presumably disagree as to whether, in the subject instance, Editor """"A"""" knew, or even suspected, the information (the year of death for the author who had just died that week) which Editor """"A"""" added to the article, was in a non-standard format. So then, if that were the case as to Editor """"A"""", I think then that Editor """"B"""" should obtain a consensus before changing (or deleting in its entirety) the information added by Editor """"A"""" in a format that Editor """"B,"""" acting alone without a consensus, believes in good faith to be a non-standard format. I think that except in the very rare case where there can be no reasonable belief that Editor """"A"""" was acting with a good faith belief that he was adding to the article, but rather, he was vandalizing it, should Editor “B” proceed to delete or edit the work of Editor “A” without first obtaining a consensus, or at the very least, to receive a (favorable) response to his request to Editor “A” that there be a change.

I believe that a procedure like this is in compliance with “assuming good faith”, which as you know is a fundamental principle on Wikipedia: It is this assumption that (other) editors' edits and comments are made in good faith. [Wikipedia:Assume good faith] that, I think, is what is missing in the approach taken by Editor “B.” That is, that Editor “B” should have approached the work (the newly added/inserted information) of Editor “A” with the assumption that we are all supposed to be operating under at all times, that Editor “A’s” additions/deletions/revisions/etc. were made in good faith, and that being the assumption, it cannot be appropriate for Editor “B” to single-handedly and without a consensus, delete all (or even part) of Editor’s “A” work. Does that strike you as an outrageous proposition? I mean, presumably Editor “A” and “B” share common flaws of imperfection found in so many humans, and presumably, going into the issue without any knowledge of the other editor, neither editor can presume that he is absolutely correct in every aspect and that anyone who views anything differently than he is a vandal intent on destroying Wikipedia. 

Isn’t it at the outset basically a 50/50 proposition when an editor goes, to delete the newly added information by another editor, that he may be wrong in making that deletion? And if it’s 50/50, shouldn’t he ask for a consensus before deleting the work of another editor, or at a bare minimum contact the other editor and have some reasonable assurance that Editor """"A"""" has received his note/email/posting/etc. before deleting Editor “’A’s” work?

I might comment that in our situation, it was not an instance of Editor “A” changing something that was already on the page and then Editor “B,” seeing what was obviously an act of vandalism in the changes by editor “A,” reverting those changes. Not at all. Editor “A” added new information (the year of death for an author who had just died), and Editor “B,” believing that it was presented in a non-standard format to have this information at that particular place, deleted it. Editor “B” believed that this date information belonged, if anywhere, only on a page devoted to the author himself, and nowhere on a page the subject of which was the author’s work, in this instance, a book.

I do in fact disagree with Editor “B” on that point. I find it very useful to see when, during an author’s lifetime, and also in relation to significant world events, an author or artist wrote or published or created a particular piece of work, Articles about the book, or other work, when discussing the writing and publishing, virtually always includes references to when he wrote the book or when he had it published and even references to when other drafts of the book were created (like Herman Melville losing the first finalized version of Moby Dick at sea and having to re-write the entire book years later, or other such interesting facts, like authors commenting that they would have changed many things in a book if they had written it after a particular event in their lives personal to them (e.g., the death of a beloved father, birth of their own child, marriage, good or bad fortunes, etc.) or events in their lives in which we collectively share in some part (the 9/11 attacks, sinking of the Titanic, WWII, War in Vietnam, the shooting of Ronald Regan/Kennedy/Kennedy/King/VJ day, VE day/man walking on the moon/the falling of the Berlin Wall, or the deaths of Roosevelt’s, Churchhill, Elvis, John Lenon,",0.0

I’m not disagreeing the fact that Hulk Hogan, let alone anyone, having a belt hanging up on their walls. I believe all the wrestlers have at least a replica of some sorts of all the titles they ever won. I remember seeing John Cena’s, Trish Stratus’s, and Chyna’s homes with a title belt hanging in their respective walls. I also recall Mick Foley mentioning that he has an “Attitude” version of the old WWF title in his closet. In the case with Hogan, he might actually have the real WCW title in his possession. He is only the greatest “Sports Entertainer” ever. I do mean ever!! However, I’m talking about the title, not the belt. I know that “possession is 9/10 of the law"""", but in this case, having the physical belt doesn’t make you a champion. Think about Rhyno and the older version of the ECW title. He has the belt, but Lashley is the Current Champion.  15:56""",0.0

Rob Schnautz (WMF), what I meant by bringing up the Okeyes (WMF) example was that he was hired to complete a specific task, i.e. to get the community involved in the development of the New Page Triage (WP:NPT) and the Article Feedback Tool/Version 5. So his task was clear to us. Since he is the point man, the go-to guy. It's very easy to get information from him. He has the two """"tool"""" talk pages, his newsletters and holds """"office hours on IRC chat. And email, plus he responds readily and to the point on his talk page. There's no confusion. Everyone knows what's going on. If he can't give a direct answer, he might say something like """"I have no control over that; I'll ask the developers if your proposal is possible and get back to you."""" He is really clear about what he can do and what is out of his hands (up to the developers or WMF or technically not feasible etc.). 
I appreciate that you and Ldavis (WMF) are community liaison people, but I only learned about you recently and I'm not sure what sorts of things you cover or what it would be appropriate to contact  you or Ldavis (WMF) about. I found out accidentally about Dennis (WMF) – or what ever his name is – because I got involved with copyvio issues and I knew Moonriddengirl handled that kind of stuff, etc. That's the first I learned of {WMF) editors around.
My big beef (which I've gotten over) was a problem with an Online Ambassador. And I kept being told, every time I asked that """"it was being handled"""" by the Steering Committee. There was zero transparency, and I even had a post removed and got very bad vibs for asking questions from some of editors (I don't know what, if any,  positions they held in  the Education Program). So I am very surprised (and relieved) to read above: """"The Steering Committee in its most recent form wasn't responsible for overseeing anything except the online ambassador management and recruitment; as a result, the current status of online ambassador recruitment and management is largely unknown.""""  
So I welcome Pine's transparency and your acknowledgment (from my point of view) of reality, and I hope that this all works out. I know that some editors keep lists of course articles in their sandbox with the goal of fixing them all up.

Sir,

It has come to my attention that despite taking advantage of our first-rate American education facilities, you insist upon identifying as a Bangladeshi.

My parents are/were Bangladeshis, and they were amongst the most wretched people I have ever had the misfortune of knowing; Indeed, during this unfortunate period of my life that I have been forced to spend in Bangladesh due to my father, I am now convinced that Bangladesh is the single most unworthy nation to exist. (I use are/were because, I regret to say, my mother was struck dead by Bangladesh - and despite her dysfunctional state and pathological lying, I mourn her loss greatly.)

Never have I felt more love for my country than now, when I find myself forced away from it! I have now given my loyalty, heart and soul, to the United States of America: The greatest country in the world, God bless every inch of it.

But after my experiences with Bangladeshis, I cannot allow for one such as yourself to leech off of the United States while offering nothing in return.

Okay, I used to be a troll and a vandal.  I used to be large amounts of my time insulting and upsetting users and ruining articles for my own amusement. Recently, I decided to turn a new leaf and become a decent, respectful contributor. I created an article called Adult Diapers in France. In this article, I included references and I hoped to create a series based on adult diaper production by country.

Within minutes , User:Escape Orbit slapped a speedy deletion notice onto my article, without even suggesting how to improve my article and claimed that I was 'advertising' and my page was 'unambiguously promotional'. This user did not even try to rewrite or improve this article.

Secondly, User:Purplewowies claimed that I should have taken the advice of this helpdesk first, then create my article. However this was not possible as I had already created my article BEFORE the helpdesk replied. Maybe the helpdesk should be more quicker.

This is an prevalent topic that should have plenty of sources to pull from. This article would benefit from you expanding upon your introductory sentence by giving some basic background on what Hollywood is, who is involved in it and other basic statistics and information about the movie or TV industry. I think the Gender inequality article will be a good model to follow for your introduction. Just make sure you're keeping it within the context of your topic. Parts of your text under """"Gender Inequality"""" are not neutral, especially """"It’s time to have wage equality once and for all. And equal rights for women in the United States of America."""" These sections simply need statistics that show how the wages or opportunities differ between men and women. I would also consider changing your subheadings to just """"Wages"""" and """"Opportunities"""" so it doesn't sound like you're projecting an opinion on the article.

I think you misunderstood me; I did not claim your arguments were """"illegitimate"""" as a whole, merely that they were less legitimate than the others. """"Legitimate"""" was probably the wrong word. You made some good points, but the request's supporters made better ones. Your opposing vote contained the following text:
Furthermore, the reason given for moving is in itself offensive. The title is objective, and the objection to it seems to be only that it doesn't adequately conform to Laval's own beliefs about what is motivating the contributors to this article. In the absence of any evidence that we're bigots, I suggest the correct move is for Laval either to demonstrate we're bigots or to apologize for slandering us.
This violates WP:AGF in the first sentence, and continues to be something akin to a personal attack. I am sure that your comments were sincere, but I think both sides allowed themselves to get riled and to speak too rashly. Your point about original research was more significant, but the term """"Anti-Quebec sentiment"""" does seem to be in fairly widespread use (I did check).
A person doesn't have to vote to voice an opinion. The instructions at the top of every poll state """"Please remember that this survey is not a vote"""", so the fact that I've inferred opinions from other parts of the debate is not a problem. It seems that 205.157.110.11 (an IP, but one with a very strong history of contructive edits) would have made an explicit vote were it not for the hot-headed wording of the proposal, and GTBacchus (an editor who I have yet to see make a mistake) also supported a very similar title. Laval, the move's proponent supported his move, of course; tjstrf proposed an alternative title, which garnered little support, and """"Marc Gévry"""" commented more on the debate than the title. This makes 3 """"votes"""" in favour of """"Anti-Quebec sentiment[s]"""", and one (yourself) directly opposed. Characterising votes for alternative titles as either support or opposition for the quoted proposal cannot be accurately done, so I omitted those from the count (but took them into consideration for the decision, of course).
I don't approve of returning to debates once they've been closed, and I really think you should move on. There is plenty of work to be done to the article, at whatever title it may be, and I'm sure you can contribute a great deal to it. Therefore, I don't wish to discuss this matter any further. I reviewed the case in good faith, and I made a decision, which I stick to.

 Maduro Criticisms and Homophobic Allegations Update 

Maduro claimed that Capriles could be killed by CIA 
Capriles said openly that if he something happens to him, that is it Maduro's doing. 
Maduro on 3/16 shut down an airport that Capriles was using that morning. 
Maduro indicates that he will shut down all """"Comida Rapida"""" or fast food restaurants on VTV on March 24th. 

Maduro states """"I do have a wife, you know? I do like women!"""" Maduro told a rally. He has also called Capriles """"a little princess."""" (sic)

Why title a section called gay rights, when the issue is moreso """"Allegations of Homophobic Comments""""

Sources on Medieval Croatia

Early medieval Croatian history fits the concluding line to the old jingle: the more you study the less you know. When I was and undergraduate studying Balkan history I thought I knew quite a bit about Croatia; but as I study more about Croatia, one by one """"facts"""" that I knew before turn out to be dubious, based on questionable sources or no sources at all. Most of the existing literature in western languages on medieval Croatia is extremely poor; and frequently it is marred by nationalistic bias.

Much of the information about medieval Croatian history comes from later (seveneenth- and eigteenth-century) narrative histories. These were written by enthusiastic people but ciontain a mixture of fact and legend; and since many of the documents they based their works on are now lost, it is extremely difficult to judge wheter their information came from reliable source or not.

Pages 33-34

One of Ladislaus's most significant achievements was the occupation of Hungary's southern neighbour, Croatia. ... The small kngdom, born in the tenth century, streched from the Kapela mountains to the Adriatic sea, its center being Biograd, located on the coast.

...
King Demetrius Zvonimir, who, not being a member of the ruling dynasty, obtained his throne throug election, asked Pope Gregory VII fo a crown in 1075, and, in return, declared his kingdom as a papal fief. After his death, Ladislaus laid claim on his realm by the right of his sister, Zvonimir's widow, and had no difficulty in taking possession of Croatia in 1091. He bestowed the new kingdom, together with royal title, on his nephew, Almos, son of Geza I ...

I further entertained myself reading yet another great discoveries of contemporary Croatian historians (soc.culture.yugoslavia) ....

The exclusive revelation is the result of """"scientific"""" research by Croatian historian Dragutin Pavlicevic, and found its place in history books. The Split newspaper """"Feral Tribune"""" reveals that Pavlicevic authored a chapter entitled """"Croatian Indians"""", included in the second grade history textbook, shedding new light on the history of native Americans and their ties with Croats, """"one of the oldest nations in Europe"""". He affirms that in North Carolina """"a tribe has been living for more than 4 centuries differing in the color of skin, hair and facial features from other tribes"""". According to the same historian this is not surprising because the members of these tribe """"have the noble blood of ancient Croats from Dubrovnik in their veins"""". Mr. Pavlicevic also speaks about the Mateo Indians, named after their ancestor Mateo - a Croat named Mate. """"In his work, Dragutin Pavlicevic stresses that he estimates that presently there are more than 2 million Croatian descendants throughout the United States"""", states the Split newspaper.

Please stop referring me to another article without answering my honest question.  Refusing to provide a simple explanation is harmful to relationships between two honest people and doesn't help anyone involved with a disagreement on WP. Please keep in mind that I am a person with feelings too, and being gang-tackled for a good faith effort on my part causes hurt feelings on the my end as well.  I hope this provides a more clear explanation why a person may lash out when he feels gang-tackled by Wikipedia editors without a quick, clear, concise explanation (should you do this to someone else in the future.)  Once again, I'll chalk this up to poor communications, rather than any malice on your part.    
Really?!? After you said """"Why should I listen to you anyway"""" it was pretty clear you didn't want me to answer you, so others stepped in; now you're blaming me for your behavior and the other people responses, and calling me a bully? All anyone here and your talk page was trying to do was help you. Please don't expect any other communication from me at this time, and stay off of User talk:208.81.184.4, as I'm going to completely wp:DISENGAGE from you.  208.81.184.4  """,0.0

"""===Canada===

In Canada, following consultation with all major religious groups, the Divorce Act was amended in 1985 to add Section 21.1 to give the courts have the power to dismiss any application, and strike out any pleadings and affidavits filed by a spouse who has failed to remove religious barriers to the remarriage of the other spouse. The legislature intended to:
place spouses on a more equal footing in civil divorce actions;
encourage women in particular to exercise fully their rights under the law; and
maintain the integrity of the Divorce Act 1985 by helping to ensure that refusing to accept or to give a religious divorce was not used as a bargaining tool to gain unfair concessions on child custody and access, or monetary support. 
This reflects a general strong response at a federal level to any elements of duress or undue influence within the civil law system.

Bruker v. Marcovitz

The justiciability of a civil contract with religious overtonese is now being tested in the Supreme Court Case of Bruker v. Marcovitz. See Canadian Civil Liberties Association. http://www.ccla.org/pos/legal/

In 1969, the parties married in an orthodox ceremony.  During the next 11 years they adopted two children after Ms. Bruker was unable to conceive.  In April of 1980, Ms. Bruker initiated divorce proceedings.   A link to the decision database is http://www.jugements.qc.ca/ and the full decision can be found with a text search for “Bruker” under “Cour d’appel”

In 1980, Mr. Marcovitz agreed upon a consent judgment for the divorce to appear immediately before Rabbinical authorities for the purpose of granting the religious Get.  Shortly, after the civil divorce, Ms Bruker, personally and through various attorneys and Rabbis, asked Mr. Marcovitz to provide the get, but Mr. Marcovitz refused. Mr. Marcovitz opined that he refused to comply because he viewed Ms. Bruker's behavior since the divorce as harassment and an attempt by her to alienate him from his children.  

Ms Bruker sued Mr. Marcovitz in 1989, seeking damages in the amount of $500,000 """"for having been restrained from going on with her life since de Decree Nisi [...], for having been restrained to remarry according to the Jewish faith [and] for having been restricted of having children"""".
 Marcovitz vs. Bruker (500-09-013353-032; September 20, 2005)

In 1995, a certificate of divorce was issued by the Rabbinical Court of Montreal with Mr. Marcovitz's consent and participation to the get.  Despite receiving the get, Ms Bruker amended her action to increase the amount of the damages claimed to $1,350,000 and to include damages """"for the loss of consortium."""" 

Since Mr. Marcovitz was in breach of a judgment of the civil court, the lower court found that the matter could be argued before the civil courts and that Mr. Marcovitz had breached his contractual obligation to """"appear before Rabbinical Authorities.  He awarded Ms. Bruker $47, 500 in damages.

On appeal, Justice Hilton, writing for the three member court, overturned the lower court judgement.  The appellate court ruled that the obligation was religious in nature and so could not be judged by the civil courts.

 """"It matters not that the obligation was stated in the Consent that the Superior Court ratified, since the Superior Court could never have entertained an application for corollary relief under section 17 of the Divorce Act to require the issuance of a ghet. It is not at all unusual to see the parties in an agreement on corollary relief undertake to perform a variety of obligations that are not, strictly speaking, obtainable independently, but which are desirable nevertheless to the extent that they promote an amicable post-divorce environment.""""

""""While I recognize the usefulness of the inclusion of obligations of this nature in divorce agreements, it does not follow that they all automatically become subject to curial supervision and control, whether for specific performance or damages in the event of a breach. In my view, in order for such clauses to be enforceable, they must be directly related to one of the subje",0.0

This isn't about discipline, at my age I don't consider """"you can't login"""" as anything like you suggest, because it's not like losing wages. It's the principle of the matter. My contribs to WQA were meticulously used as spin against me, instead of the AGF everyone else saw them as. I don't intend to let Fram sit on a high horse any longer. Either they apologise first and withdraw their false assertions, or they'll have to explain them to RfC or ArbCom. Which I'm sure is much more complex and time consuming and stressful than admitting to any wrong-doing, but so be it, I stand for what I believe in and always have. I won't be bullied by someone like that. So really, the ball is in their court. If no one is counting coup, that applies to the admin who attacked me in an undignified manner, and continues to do so by maintaining their position – though now shielding themselves behind a wall of admins instead of facing up to the fact they erred. COI is clearly affecting their actions, or unwillingness to show face. They can either opt-in and admit they were wrong for their attack, or wait until a higher channel, one that even exceeds their stance, asks why they attacked my contribs and synthesised a despicable """"bad faith"""" conclusion. The consequences this dispute have yet to be determined.  [Chat • RFF] """,0.0

You chosed with your sick mind wikipedia to sling mud at other schools thinking that you are the owner of wikipedia and creating multiple divisions amongst school in Sri Lnaka basically to promote your Prestigious Royal College, Colombo because you know it is hard to maintain the prestige in current Sri Lanka.

"This is anecdotal so I don't know how to use it. According to my son in law, currently a staff crew member on Grimm, they use three cameras, running two at nearly all times: one on a railed dolly and one low (probably on a so-called sawed-off, or else on a high-hat tripod. A third, hand-held on Steadycam, is added as needed. However, this is NOT the 3, 4, or 5 classic cameras on pedestals rolled around a studio floor for a standard multi-camera sitcom shoot. On Grimm, the setups are completely custom for each sequence. However, when shooting all-digital on ARRIs, recording costs nothing, so they can get quick coverage and footage that would task an old-style production's film budget. He says they will sometimes shoot 10 pages a day. Given the quality of the lighting and coverage, this is astonishing to anyone used to the obsolete Hollywood procedures.",0.0

You are only now presenting sources for some of the information which you have inserted. In your last revision of the article, you did not cite the sentence about fundamentalism. Once again, the statement about public schools and ID materials was unsourced when you first added it, which is why I removed it. Upon further examination, I removed the statement again because the article never explictly stated that the Centre for Intelligent Design was responsible for the distribution of these intelligent design materials to public schools. It is actually very unlikely that this Centre for Intelligent design did so, in light of the fact that the government proclamation was issued in 2006, and this organization arose in 2010. Finally, believing in the historicity of Adam and Eve does not make one a fundamentalist. Many Christians reconcile the Genesis creation narrative with science (see the BioLogos Foundation for example, which advocates evolutionary creation). The entire Roman Catholic Church (1 billion people) teaches the historicity of Adam and Eve and that does not make them Young Earth Creationists or fundamentalists. I have filed a case on this dispute here and encourage your participation in it. I hope this helps. Thanks, Talk 08:23",0.0

"""

The user's final edit was to blank his Talk page with the edit summary """"fuck it.""""  The page blanking was reverted """"because of an active block"""".  The block is no longer active, the user has not returned to Wikipedia, and I think it is pretty clear that """"fuck it"""" is the equivalent of """"I am retiring from Wikipedia.""""  It seems to me that if someone has expressed quite clearly that they don't want to come back to Wikipedia and that they don't want their sad saga displayed on their Talk page for all eternity, that is within their rights.
Also, I question whether the initial reversion of the page blanking was even according to policy.  Show me one policy that says you cannot blank active block messages on your talk page, hmmm?  While WP:DRC is merely a guideline, there is a distinct lack of Wikipedia policy limiting what kind of content users can remove from their Talk page.  I happen to think there should be policy limiting what a person is allowed to remove from their own talk page (e.g. warnings <24 hours old and active block notices) but as it currently stands there is no such policy, at least not that I can find.  (If I am wrong, please enlighten me!)
If I have to abide by rules I think are dumb, then so does everybody else.  In fact, that is the difference between us and Karaku  Karaku disagreed with the rules so he chose to aggressively break them and call everyone else ignorant.  I disagree with the rules, but I realize they have been formed by community consensus and so I will abide by them as long as they are in place.  And by my interpretation of the current rules, Karaku's blanking of the Talk page should never have been reverted.  
Furthermore, while I recognize that I was using the word """"VANISH"""" imprecisely, it appears to be a longstanding tradition in Wikipedia that if a user wants to just leave and clear out the ugly history of their wrongdoing, they have the right to do that.  Karaku very clearly indicated a desire to do just that (is there really that much difference between putting a banner saying """"Retired"""" at the top of your Talk page vs. blanking the thing with the edit summary """"fuck it""""?).
Anyway, I'm obviously not going to get in an edit war over a retired user's talk page.  I'm just sort of surprised at the insistence to leave all this stuff in place when the user doesn't want it and Wikipedia policy provides no mechanism to override those wishes...   """,0.14285714285714285

practicing Buddhist, and many of the key ideas in my approach are Buddhist or Buddhist
inspired. First and foremost, Nagarjuna and Madhyamika; pure Emptiness and primordial Purity
is the ‘central philosophy’ of my approach as well. Also Yogachara, Hua Yen, a great deal of
Dzogchen and Mahamudra, and yes, the fundamentals of Abhidharma…. Again, I’m trying to

 MY STATEMENT 

AND WHAT IS IT I DID EXACTLY TO BE BANNED?
WILL SOMEBODY PLEASE EXPLAIN?
You are obviously not aware of what is goinf ´g on I am ban for not contributing at all with the talk page!! what ? I am the one who asked for this mediation for more than 2 weeks ago and it was for something else than that and this snowskinner who was asked to bring the arbitration knows it perfectly. And i am the one working out ot bring the two best cosmolog in the world to look at those thesis, ans I am the one who did contributed the most in this affair together with Igor Bogdanov, at the refute of those falsifications of evidencies presented here by ybm and his acolytes.
I was ban because ybm had been ban and couldn't stand it.
But where he was ban 24 hours for insulting repaeatridly people and calling Igor Bogdanov a bastard 3 times and for having on several occassions oversteped the 3RR rule, I was ban 3 x 24 hours for having presented an article who was evaluated by Bidhonene who is a very endeared friend of YBM, for not being so usefull as she wish.
An article containing of course a serie of evidenscies who didn't have been shown before, and who constiture a major block against the conspiratorial arguments of ybm and his gang.
Just as she did it here on my talk page when she deleeted it all, and vnever reinserted it, a precious document proving the ´factual connection between YBM and this Voyer who infatuated this whole affair.
It was YBM who had invited his friend on my talkpage, until he realized that i had an arbitration going on that was about this.
Bishonen blocked me 20 minutes after her protegé had been blocked.
i dont see any of her interventions in this talk page concerning the insults of rjb and ybm, nor concerning their cynical and very empty and longs comments about my mediation on the talk page tonight.
You can read my articles yourself and see how hard I was fighting to make sure that the situation will not degenerate further, and to calm down the spirit.
She didn't make an intervention there to ask rjb and ybm to stop their acction and provocating attitudes, nor accused them for saying nothing nor removed their articles for not improving the talk page, nor contributing with anything on it.
She has already been told to don't interfeer anymore on this talk page because she is unable to differentiate between  her liking and her work as an admi.
She does not follow the rules and do a very destructiv work, using retaliation and arbitrarious judgement all the time, and always something who arranged ybm very much.
She even do revert for him and use her status to commit illegitimate stuff.
The arbitration should have been about this too.
They are using the fact that mediator Nicholas turnbull is out for a week to do their bad deeds.
And this snowsnippers know that what he does is out of hand, and that he should never have done it.
He even insulted Nicholas turnbull.
Easy when people aren't there to defend themselves.
Wiki english is a spot on the face of Wikipédia, admi are behaving like sabotors and vandaliser and encourage riot, and abuse of their knoledge and power to undermine actions made to refrein their wrong doing.

This has to stop.
I asked for a mediation and an arbitration comity for more than two weeks and Sowspinners actions are completely unlegitimate.
He has stollen MY mediation and MY arbitration request.
This don't go and has to be aborted.
I do not recognise the actual arbitration for being legitimate, and thereby ask all to boycot it.

None of the involved administrator can in anyway be part of the arbitration comity or of the arbitration.
It is a close debate and not an arena game.
THis arbitration was supposed to be hold secret, as snowspinner knows very well, and took some very unlucky initiatives from the very beginning.
He is an idiot to have done that, and has no sens of responsability, nor of maturity, and cannot be trusted.
He must be removed as well.
i dont accept what happened tonight. There was absolutly no reasons for me to be blocked and certainly not for 3 days.
If I say fuck! like ybm nothing happen, but if I bring precious evidencies, so I am ban and the evidencies confiscated and destroy yes, and detroyed as they have been alredy here several times.
This is the sign of a totalitarian system, and wiki english has became a totalitarian system, where the judged perform the judgement, and were all proofs are stollen and destroyed and were disturbing people are threaten for their meaning and impert to say more, and blocked away.

Nowhere in the Jihad Against Zionists and Crusaders fatwa, does the WIF limit the membership of the organization to Muslim.

""":Hi Labongo. Just to clarify a little, the criterion about self-identification as an indigenous people is actually one that is frequently and explicitly used by the major sources and bodies concerned with indigenous peoples' affairs and status. It was paraphrased a little for the article, but if you examine a few of the most-consulted definitions (such as UN, World Bank, ILO, etc) you will see that it's embedded in many of these formulations, with a deliberate intent. See for example the definitional quotes from these organisations, that used to be in the 'definitions' section of this article but now seems to have been split off into Definitions of the term Indigenous. As such, I think the criterion needs to remain mentioned along with the others that appear in the opening paras.

The statement """"Note that even if all the above criteria are fulfilled, some people may either not consider themselves as indigenous or may not be considered as indigenous by governments, organizations or scholars"""" does not quite mean the same thing. While that statement itself is fine as far as it goes, IMO it's not an adequate replacement. Self-identification and recognition is part of the """"set"""" of criteria that are often referred to in indigenous rights contexts.

I can see some rationale in the recent splitting out of the former content of the 'definitions' section into that separate article, however at the same time I think that this present indigenous peoples article does need to devote perhaps more space than we usually do to covering definitions and usage of terms/terminology. It's an area where there's a lot of general misconception and confusion between the common, adjectival and the formal, specific usage of words like indigenous, and even of the concept of indigenous peoples' rights and concerns (a lot of the discourse on this talkpg and others related are along these lines, for eg.) I think we could probably spare a few more paras to cover the most salient points and prominent definitions, so the detail's not all spliced away into a different article. Thoughts?  ʘ TALK

Re: the """"rushing"""" comment ODF:

Personally I think the entire discussion of formulas is out of place in the Standardization section.  See the entry on Microsoft Office Open XML for an example of what is a better writeup, IMHO.  Keep the Standardization section to the basics of what, when and where, the type of summary info that should be upfront and easily found in an encylopedia entry.  Put the debates or other side issues in their own section.

Also, a comment by a member of OASIS does not necessarily reflect OASIS policy or even the majority view of the ODF TC.  It is just one person's opinions at one point in time.  The use of the word """"rushed"""" needs to be subtantiated, otherwise it is merely opinion.  Since I can also point to opinions on the web that say that ODF was not rushed, I think we'll both need to acknowledge that this is a debatable point, and either both sides of the argument should be presented, or an unadorned statement of the facts presented.

If we want to state the facts, we could mentioned when the ODF specification started standardization (December 2002), when comments on the lack of spreadsheet formulas were brought up (February 2005) and when the OASIS standard was issued (May 2005).  Was this a sign of rushing?  Or was it merely the case that it was too late in the ODF 1.0 process to take on this additional work?  It is certainly possible for the later to be true without the former.  2+ years for a standard is not typically evidence of rushing.

In any case, my vote would be to move this item to its own section, or perhaps to Standard office document formats debate.

Regards,

But, the resulting view seems to imply bias in your preceding considerations. For instance, you've assumed I wanted Roux gone, when there's never been any such expressed desire from me, either im- or explicitly, neither before nor now. It also seems that you've excused Roux for some of the behaviour you admonish me for (not to say I feel I should be excused from anything I've done).
If I may express my opinion, Roux is a good editor, but generally only when working alone or without opposition or critique; yes, I bare my own biases, but I come to that conclusion having seen his interactions with others in addition to my own experiences, and recent events seem to show that it isn't changing. It is my sense that in these circumstances he genuinely believes himself to be a victim, and, seemingly sensing some threat, responds to the most gentle criticism with the most vicious vitriol. While that can cause some problem in itself, the preverbal shit hits the fan when thrown into the mix are stubborn individuals who don't buy his claims of innocence and casualty, after which the intensity of the conflict increases exponentially. If it wasn't already obvious: I am one of those stubborn persons, believing we alone are responsible for our own actions. Thus, I honestly don't for one minute buy that Roux was """"driven"""" to do anything; he chose to participate here in the manners that he did, both good and bad, and he chose to leave; just as I chose to participate in the manners that I did, chose to leave, chose to come back, chose to leave again, chose to come back, and choose to admit much of my editing habits were the wrong way to go about things. I like the idea of Roux no longer being an obstacle, but do not feel comfortable about the way in which it came to be; I'm not sure that anybody's actually won in this case.   """,0.0
"Appalling. 'F' for Fail ==

As it now stands, this article is grossly inadequate and misleading. The 'development' at the centre of a sonata structure is in reality a 'Durchführung'  i.e. a 'leading through' various keys. The word 'development' is a poor translation of this  and has generated a situation in which foolish people analyse a stretch of music not according to what happens in it, but in terms of what this wrong word happens to make them think of. As every German muscologist and textbook knows, the point of a 'development section' is *not* various varietites of 'thematic modification'  it is *tonal and harmonic instability* after the stability of the second-subject key and before the restoration of the tonic. Has no-one actually bothered to listen to what does   and doesn't  happen in the included extract...?!? IT'S MODULATORY, AND THAT'S ALL. 

This article is too deeply confused to be rescued. It should just be deleted. Hell, it doesn't have a single worthwhile source... or any idea about the original German terminology...  Pathetic...

It just happens that this particular issue, Ben's page, is something that I am devoting everything I can to..I believe in it, and in what has happened because of him. I truly do not mean to be disrespectful to other members, but find that I see room for interpretation in many policies and...I'm finding that I have a problem with the jabs flying around. I hear what you are saying about the page not being the place to argue about the policies...but that seems to get folded into things when people can look at the very same words and see different things.
I am not ashamed to say that I am literally praying that this page does not get deleted. There was a huge impact here and I did take the time to read approximately 600-800 messages left to Ben on places like Legacy.om and on his Breedlove tv channel. It is not cliche stuff; it is real, poignant, and in many cases very specific examples of how he changed their lives. To me, it is also noteworthy when thousands of teenagers risk peer judgement to leave such messages.
This is a phenomenon that happens to fall within the category of something making things better. I hope that has a place in cultural history at Wikipedia.

My point is simply that if there is anyone who refrains from commenting, for or against, because of the identifiaction issue, then there is a possibility of bias. (If the pros and cons are equally reluctant, then the bias is only a technical one.)

"Joehazelton and a Humble question 
My humble Wikiquestion is - are editors even held accountable for libel or slander, as in real life, considering the reach and readership of Wikipedia.  What checks and balances are in place for rogue editor & admin, sophisticated in the policies, but manipulating said polices to achieve the same results.

In reading and researching, it would appear that many Editors and Admins, are behaving, contrary to the lofty goals of the Wikiproject, in order to forward personal or political agenda. Also what evidence is necessary to prove and rebuke and discipline such editors and Admin that are consistently and repeatedly violating 3RR and NPOV policy, if not in name, but certainly in sprit and in fact accuse other editors, who perform legitimate edits for the very thing that these rouges are engaged in?

Is what Wikipdia critics say is true, in that Wikipdia is the play ground of the faceless and nameless, who are not beholding or accountable to the rule of law or is Wikipdia truly has respected place, with proper review, oversight or accountability for actions, contrary to stated and publish policy?

My experance, so far, with due respect, would be the first, rather then the later.

3. Stop playing good cop- bad cop with your fucking retarded Dahn hack Forestgarden

4. Accept all Korean language sources you stupid bitch!! How dare you try to stifle and censor articles in the name of your fucked up cult. Your Forestgarden bitch believes its within Wiki policy to include Korean language articles when reporting on favorable aspects of your bitch master. Why don't you include all the other more negative portrayals in the Korean language. Also, who said this Itsahappyday fuckhead deserves to translate any Korean? This should all be disputed, you fucking racist, neo-nazi reject?

5. Stop using the word cynical to describe your """"enemies."""" You come off even more retarded than your Ilchee bitch master. Your philosophical maturity is less than that of a first grader. The world is """"cynical."""" Those who don't believe in Dahn are """"cynical."""" I can't wait until South Park makes an episode about your bitch cult. 

6. Are you fucking insane? Korea is the center of the universe? Korea as a cultural hub? Korea the place where the next messiah appears? You Dahn people never cease to amaze when it comes to your thought processes. Korea is not what your Ilchee bitch believes it to be. Think about it retard- the fucking nation of Palau has more of a right to talk about religious heritage than the fucking hermit kingdom. How can you be so retarded, that you choose a Korean cult? If you chose a Chinese or Indian one, at least it would show you have some portion of a brain. Coming to Korea and joining a Korean cult with Korea-centric views is more retarded than travelling to Antartica in search of good coffee while visiting Columbia in search of ice and snow.

Résumé
Cette étude porte sur l’actualisation de la stature moyenne en Europe. Contrairement aux idées reçues, il apparaît, selon notre
enquête réalisée sur 2705 garçons et 2842 filles âgés de 17 ans, que les adolescents des Alpes Dinariques sont, en moyenne,
les plus grands d’Europe. Avec une stature moyenne de 185,6 cm, ils se situent devant les Néerlandais, qui mesurent 184 cm.
C’est surtout la densité de sujets de très grande taille qui confère à la région des Alpes Dinariques sa caractéristique, avec 28%
de sujets de plus de 190 cm, alors que les Néerlandais n’en comptent que 20% et la France 1,5%. Chez les filles, bien que l’on
ne dispose pas de beaucoup d’informations, les adolescentes dinariques, avec une stature moyenne de 171 cm, se situent juste
derrière les Néerlandaises. Pour citer cet article  J.-C. Pineau et al., C. R. Biologies 328 (2005).

Abstract
Average height of adolescents in the Dinaric Alps. This study contributes to an update of average heights among European
populations. Our investigation covering 2705 boys and 2842 girls aged 17 years, shows that, contrary to the general belief,
adolescents of the Dinaric Alps are, on average, the tallest in Europe. With an average height of 185,6 cm, they are taller than
Dutch adolescents (184 cm on average). Above all, the density of very tall subjects appears to be characteristic of the Dinaric
Alps, since 28% measure 190 cm or more in height, as opposed to only 20% in Holland and 1.5% in France. Although our
information is not complete, adolescent girls in the Dinaric Alps, with an average height of 171 cm come a close second to girls
in Holland. To cite this article: J.-C. Pineau et al., C. R. Biologies 328 (2005).

Abridged English version
The diachronic increase in the stature of European
peoples has always been of interest to anthropologists.
Since the 1960s and until now, Scandinavians of both
sexes had been the tallest Europeans, followed, in descending
order, by the Dutch, Danes, Norwegians and
Swedes.
With the recent enlargement of the European Community,
it has become necessary to establish which
European country has the tallest adolescents on average.
In 1968, Montenegrin teenagers, with an average
height of 176.9 cm, had already been found to be the
tallest, followed by Norwegians at 173.6 cm. Since
then, there has been a significant increase in average
heights in all European countries, especially Holland,
where the average height among adolescents increased
the fastest (8 cm in 40 years), to reach 184 cm in
2000. However, given the lack of recent data on average
heights among inhabitants of the Dinaric Alps, we
carried out a study to update the information available.
The study was conducted among 17 year-olds (2705
boys and 2844 girls) in schools in various towns in
Herzegovina and central Dalmatia. Boys, unlike girls,
are still growing in height at 17 years of age. Different
longitudinal studies have shown that boys, on
average, grow by at least one centimetre between the
ages of 17 and 20. We have therefore added one centimetre
to all average heights for boys. As in other
European countries, height is influenced by the social
environment: in our study, lycée pupils were found to
be 2–3 cm taller on average than pupils in vocational
schools. Taking these variations into account as well
as observed differences between coastal and inland
communities, we found that",0.0

"Nature of the holdings in Mimms and Miller/“Police” vs. “peace officer” 

In carefully reviewing these cases, I cannot find support for the language I used several years ago, so I’ve revised it to strictly reflect what the Court actually said. Although the Court did not expressly require that a peace officer cite particularized concern for his safety, they did not expressly say that it was unnecessary, either.

The clarification of “federal law” is also important, because the Supreme Court, empowered under Article III of the US Constitution, cannot really grant “authority” to a peace officer; rather, they are limited to interpretation of laws and review for conformance with the Constitution, as they make quite clear in the citation from Mimms.

I’ve added a tag to the assertion that state law may not allow drivers or passengers to be ordered to exit the vehicle; though this assertion may be correct, it’s pretty sweeping, and needs support. It may be particularly significant in light of the Death of Sandra Bland. Many pundits have insisted that Ms. Bland’s failure to exit her car when so ordered provided cause for arrest, usually citing Mimms and Miller, and perhaps Texas Transportation Code §542.501. The Supreme Court holdings were of course limited to the Fourth Amendment, and did not (and could not) consider whether refusal to exit a vehicle after being so ordered violated state law; unless the Commerce Clause of Article I is somehow involved (and this seems unlikely), that would be a matter for state legislators to regulate, and state courts to interpret. Some states well may have done so; however, I have been unable to find anything close to dispositive, and have not seen anyone else do so. I am not going to make a project of running this down, but if someone else can provide this information, it would seem a great addition. Hopefully, any such reference would cite real decisional law that is unambiguous to the average reader, rather than a mere assertion by a third party (if the third party cannot cite authority, that party’s assertion is suspect).   

 “Police” vs. “peace officer” 
I do not understand the suggestion that “peace officer” or “law enforcement officer” is strictly the proper term needs support; I think the linked WP article makes it quite clear that either of these terms—which refer to a superset of “police officer”—are the strictly correct usage. I used “police” simply because in some other articles, other editors—usually IP—kept changing it to “police officer,” and the bickering seemed a poor use of time. And I reasoned that if the Supreme Court can use “police”—correctly or otherwise—we cannot be faulted for doing so here. Whoever added that tag did not give a reason; absent some good reason to keep it (or perhaps a suggested rewording of the note), I’m inclined to remove the tag.",0.0

 Answer to my question re: web site for both sides controversial issues 

I'm interested in a wide range of issues.  I tend to be liberal politically and enjoy discussing issues with some conservative friends.  On some issues I have made up my mind but would like to understand the other side.  On other issues, I'd like to get more information or at least a good starting point of the the key points of both sides and places to looks further.  going on an issue-by-issue basis is OK but very time consuming. Also, you get a lot of misleading information by looking at sites that promote their point of view. it would be great if there was a web site that had already done this.  Like having an intelligent person research each issue and then give you a one-page summary like """" Here's the issue, here are the two or three main sides, here's the philisophical underpinning for each side, and here are the main points each side makes, backed up by these references."""" 

examples:

Global warming - Wiki is pretty good
guantanamo
stem cells
big government vs small
tax cuts for wealthy
alternative energy policy
civil liberties
separattion fo church and state.
funding for education

and on an on

Speedy deletion of Shree Swami Abhiramdasji Tyagi
 A tag has been placed on Shree Swami Abhiramdasji Tyagi requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. —  (say whaaat?!)

Hi Red - When you get a chance, take a look at the Charles E. Bassett article. I've addressed just about all of the suggestions that you have made - at least up to this point. It may require further tweaking, here and there, but I think you'll find my latest version very much closer to what you hand in mind. While I have your attention  I had an idea that you might be able to assist with - since your technical chops are undoubtedly better than mine. In short - Is it possible to move the """"Dodge City Peace Commission"""" photo from its current location, blow it up to a larger size, and place that enlarged photo so that it is placed in what is currently a large blank space next to the Table of Contents? I think it would make a far more attractive page. I probably should mention that, prior to turning to writing full-time, I worked for several years as a corporate art director - who specialized in page layouts. Let me know what you think about the idea. Also let me know if there are any remaining issues with the Bassett article that you think should be addressed. I'm sure we can work together.   """,0.0

Do you really want to have external links that have outdated/wrong info about an article in Wikipedia?

This link takes you to the earliest revision history page of UST Global. Please find when this page was initially drafted and when did the user Steve Ross started editing the page. This wikipedia page was started in 2005 and Steve came in to picture by 2007. The most interesting thing here you can find is the first few edits by Steve Ross. He added himself as co-founder of UST where right now he wants to mention himself as founder of the company. Don’t you find that this user is inconsistent with his edits and this proves that his intention is to advertise himslef? Also could you please check whether this user has contributed anything else in this Wiki page other than adding his name in different roles of UST Global?

All you want to know about UST Global is available in their website (www.ust-global.com).

"Daizus, what you need to do is find a reliable scholar that makes the same arguments you make about what Boia says, and cite him or her saying them  in reply to Boia (and not in a dialog that you set up), without introducing weasel words to raise your point from the ground, and without launching into your own theories about how ancient writers used to gather material. For starters. 
As for the rest: you need to find yourself reliable historians that say this and that, cite them saying it, and differentiate between them and Boia, with the knowledge of the fact that you will also allow other criticisms to be expressed. Regardless of my unfamiliarity with the subject, I know that historians of the antiquity in Romania and elsewhere also doubt the identification, and I know that it is prevalent in Romanian historiography for very political reasons.
For these reasons, the merger is POV. Even if the prevalent tone would be that historians agree Dacians and Gatae are one and the same (and I doubt it will ever be), the debate is likely to be open forever, and we need to give readers that information, not the one that suits us.",0.0

hey warrens, fuck you too. """"Uncivil manner, means me trying to elaborate on my arguments and getting  revert on revert that's what uncivil means. So yeah your a big winner champ and won't get banned. Asshole. 

Since the vista article contains information about the anti trust situation which, since it seems some people here have got a mouthful of gate's balls, is mislabelled anti trust controversy. Not really a controversy though is it when a court elected by over two hundred million people issues a decision, it'a court ruling, like it or not there's no controversy too that. Otherwise we should renaim the ted bundy trial, to the tend bundy controversy, since any court ruling merits this label. 

Since there's a section on anti trust laws and vista, it's worth noting the recent news that microsoft are going to be paying a hefty daily fine for completely ignoring the court's injuction. And this does have bearing on vista. You can't quote the m.s. pr saying we don't know what they want us to do, it's all questions, or whatever else he mentioned, without an adjunct sentence, of the head official regulating the anti trust actions quoting him too saying that our injuctions are crystal clear yet ms has ignored them for over two years now. 

But of course this has no bearing if this article is supposed to be a showcase for vista.

So like i said, if some fuckers had gone into the trouble of actually discussing any of that instead of reverted every single edit in a hitleric fashion, things would be different.

But for now this stategy of being a hawk on an article I wish to keep in a certain way, and being completely uncivil and rude about it, merits from my part a roayl, fuck y's all, take your mouths off of gate's balls and then we can talk.

its a fair point...... but why oh why did i do so much fulfilling all of the wikpedia guidlines for personal content , editting style , correct sourcing and referencing , wiki formatting etc .....months tireless work on an article which was to be so casually consigned to the dustbin....... 

however much i respect your views, a redirect to the clairvoyance article  would however be entirely meaningless... one is not exchangeable for the other...  like cheese isn`t milk etc.....

covering the groundwork general background to establish a context for understanding extra sensory phenomena in general needed to be done  and it might as well happen at the Clairsentience page for now.....  

the reason i did it there was because fundamental doubts were being expressed about my earliest article`s conents were concerned implicitly announcing that the background for understanding extra sensory phenomena in general had not been done.... which was  ... as remember saying to you a few weeks ago   the frustrating context which motivated the writing of the second article with all of its references to the background research of brennan , lylle , mckenna , bohm , wilber , sheldrake   etc......because this background had to be established before any specifics about clairsentience could even be begun to be aproached  ....... thus the many weeks days and months of toil which has been endured to even get this background matereal into a wikpedia format and guidlines shape  ......  all of which criterea have been met  .... or at leasst  were until the finished product was mindlessly deleted...

Your usual obfuscation. There is no reason even to bring up the mathematically complicated natural/free convection when forced convection (the common type that happens in car radiators) works just as well as illustration. Choaygame is technically and perfectly correct that only internal energy (not heat) can be advected as a bulk flow of matter containing energy within it and moved from here to there. That means heat pumps don't really pump heat but rather energy. Heat cannot because heat cannot be stored in matter since the amount of it there, cannot even be defined! If you can't put a number on it you can't claim it's """"real """".

Temperature and thus kinetic energy may  play only minor roles in this, when energy of phase transitions is involved. For example water can be turned to steam and sent down a pipe to transfer energy by condensing somewhere else, and yet the temp changes are very small as small as you like for a given transfer. They are markets for direction of transfer but cannot be used to quantitate how much energy is moved. That's a clue that they aren't fundamental and are in no way the core of what is happening physically. Physically it is potential energy being moved, not unlike moving a charged battery from here to there. It actually has nothing to do with """"heat"""" in a thermodynamic sense. 18:46, 14""",0.0

Thank you for your contribution to the Grand Army Plaza article in Wikipedia. However, I removed the edit for the following two reasons.

 You furnished no references. Please see Wikipedia:Verifiability
 Furnishing a nine year range as documentation for the statue's removal is, essentially, wordage that conveys no information.

"Sure they're subjective - they're rhetorical: I was arguing a case. I still think that the single arrival point (article to which all others direct) should be the most neutral. I believe that that, when dealing with periods in the past, should be assumed to be the title used in the subject's own time (necessarily adjusted for the English language, in an E Lang encyclopedia) - here, Philip the Tetrarch. The Herod Philips have to be there, because people will search for them. These pages should note that there is disagreement about the use of the name and that there is very little firm evidence surviving from that time, and then send the seeker to the historical name. If someone with more knowledge than my own adds a note to the effect that 'Theologians use ... and historians use ...', that would be a welcome addition. This means that all the terms would be in wikipedia; they would all be findable; and there would be a central page which would contain all relevant information, and I trust everything that any user of an encyclopedia might want. I don't want to MOVE any pages, just tidy up the way of finding them. I don't think this is as strong an advice as you do; more of a signpost (perhaps a better image than 'guide'?)

 Regarding your email 
Go ahead.  32 
I've looked things over.  I don't see anything that requires a block or administrative action in any way.  This is a new user who is unfamiliar with Wikipedia's conflict of interest guidelines and needs to be gently directed that way.  Ask him to use the article talk page and discuss the matter cordially with him.  The sort of things you sent me go one many times every day on Wikipedia.  I could find a dozen or more conversations in the last 24 hours that look functionally identical to the one you sent me, and it isn't particularly unusual or out of the norm.  It's just someone who is unfamiliar with Wikipedia, and upset because they don't understand how Wikipedia works.  In the spirit of WP:DOLT we need something like WP:DOCOI: Don't Overlook Conflicts of Interest.  People with conflicts of interest may have valid concerns about article content, we shouldn't brush them off as though they don't have something valuable to add to the discussion.  We should instead try to work with them in alleviating their concerns, or at least educate them in Wikipedia's policies (keeping in mind they are an outsider).  Be gentle and clear.  That's my advice.  Also, direct him to express his concerns on-wiki rather than via email; discussions of article content should happen in the open.  32 

Wondering what you think
Hello TOJ. I agree with your removal of the multitude of run times in the Once Upon a Time in America. On the other hand I would ask you to consider including the European run time of 229 minutes. Various considerations include the fact that runtime is the one that premiered at Cannes also we include both the Cannes and US release dates in the infobox and we could label the two runtimes the same way. One other thing, while I can't remember the exact time frame but I know the 229m version did get showings in the US within a few months (maybe weeks) of the short versions release because, much like the two releases of Brazil, I held off going to the theater until I could see the longer version. If you disagree that is okay this was just a suggestion. If you want to move this discussion to the films talk page that is okay too. Cheers and have a good week.  | Talk

Philosophy deals with such general and fundamental problems as the sorts of things which exist, and the nature, scope and limits of knowledge, understanding, moral judgments, mind and language. and their relationships with each other and the world Philosophy is distinguished from other ways of addressing these questions the theology by its critical approach using reasoned argument, accepting no higher authority than reason.

""":: Hmm, Thinking about it, getting involved in a more elaborate argument around the question the question of rigor or lack-there-of is fairly useless. To me, the SI's dismissal of Black Mask seems like a ideal example of rigor but I suspect we'd disagree about a lot. I'll boil the general argument down to the point that the intended mission of wikipedia is producing a neuteral summary of generally agreed facts about historically significant actors, in this case the SI. The question of Debord's dictatorial control is clearly a partisan position, therefore it should hardly be presented prominently (though it's certainly a fact the many have claimed this). The split with the Nashists was *A* significant event during period of development of the Situationists. But to call it *THE* significant event is to make earlier development of group more important than the latter development. Debord and Sanguinetti's book """"The Real Split In The International"""" could just as well be called the """"fundamental split"""" if you took later Situationist developments as more important. Naturally, a neuteral account would take neither position - it could still mention one or both. 
Your claims that my lack of interest in the Nashists represent anti-Scandinavians racism might perhaps be considered another instance of your humor, perhaps? In anycase, the studies of the SI that come to mind are Sadie Plant or Len Bracken. Even Greil Marcus has some useful stuff. Indeed, in the clearly partisan Bob Black essay the introductory paragraphs still winds-up with a somewhat more balanced view of the group than the current entry here (though clearly there's still a """"revive the honor of forgotten Second Situationist Internation"""" thing going on). 
In anycase, I reviewed the history of text and it seem that the first or two paragraphs are essentially tacked-on afterwards. This explains the disjointed quality of the text as a whole - it clearly needs rewriting. 
As far as links go, certainly inclusive links are another option - it is simply that the entry would have to be vastly MORE inclusive than the present entry if you wanted to include all links to comments and critiques on the Situationists.

 Nicosia and discrimination against Greek contributors and the Greek character of the city 

Dear Salvio,

You have accused me of abusive behaviour against other users and consequently blocked me from editing the article on Nicosia for a 24 hour period.

May I draw to your attention that it is fairly obvious that those three users namely Seb az86556 , Seric2  and Chesdovi) are clearly constantly creating a picture of Nicosia as a decadent muslim city that serves their religious beliefs and are all clearly hailing form Turkish backgrounds.

There is a constant undermining of the city´s Greek identity i.e. whenever a Greek flag, that is OMNIPRESENT in the Republic of Cyprus whether some people like it or detest it but this is the reality and an Encyclopedia that wishes to be UNBIASED should depict the REALITY and not the subjective views of a minority of readers that are furthermore based on extremist religious and nationalistic views. On the other hand, such users do find it appropriate to throw in pictures using the Turkish and the ILLEGAL, yes illegal according to United Nation referendums flat of the non-recognised internationally illegal self-proclaimed state of the so-called TRNC.

It is totally UNACCEPTABLE to have extremist nationalistic individuals, that strategically reached the level of administrators, deteriorating all the time the article on the city of Nicosia, promoting an unrealistic Turkish character and undermining the Greek character of the city AND  at the same time having an ADDITIONAL article on """"North Nicosia"""" that is depicting a totally FALSE picture w.r.t the city. The TRNC is illegal, not recognised by any state other than Turkey and some terrorist states that are non-democratic and yet Wikipedia has a page on Northern Nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of Cyprus. This is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on Northern Nicosia stressing how Turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for Nicosia and emphasize the Turkish character of the city, talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the Greek character.

This is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable Greek character of the area controlled by the   Republic of Cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the Republic of Cyprus the mere fact that Wikipedia has a site that is CONSTANTLY vandalised by several ethnic Turkish extremists and Wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour.

In the light of all of this, I shall stop contributing to Wikipedia as I consider it downgrading for my own self. Furthermore, I do not wish to participate in an """"encyclopedic"""" project that is totally biased and discriminatory.

"As far as Muslims are concerned any criticism of Islam is hate speech. I have been a Muslim for five years and know perfectly the hatred that Muslims have for apostates and the level of intolerance towards their critics. Been there, done that myself, without even being aware of it. It all seemed normal to do. Today I find myself on the other side of the fence. Quoting opinions contrary to those believed by Muslims is not hate speech. The Quran is filled with hate speech. Look at the article Ali Sina for example: that is hate speech. The very language is despiteful. My every contribution to Islamofascims, Islamofobia and Ali Sina are removed. The only reason is because they are not in agreement with Islamic creed. We must not allow Wikipedia to be converted into an Islamic tool of propaganda. Both views must be expressed equally. Take the example of Sina’s page. There we have six comments made by anonymous Muslims calling him all names including a mischievous liar, a rabid anti Islamist, Islamophobe, etc. In the paragraph that said “Ali Sina is a controversial personality” I quoted an example of how diverse are the opinions of Sina’s fans from those of his foes.  This is not to agree with those opinions. Muslims resisted this example tooth and nail, with all inane and invalid excuses. I made it clear that this is not an endorsement of those views and the notability of the people making those allegations or praises are not important. They are just a sample of what people say about him. It goes from one extreme to another. I think both examples should be stated so the claim that he is a controversial is supported with these examples. Why Muslims do not want to have any mention of what Sina’s fans say about him and only the insults of his foes are mentioned? Any fool will see this article is written by people with an axe to grind against it subject. 
Since I joined Wikipedia, every contribution I made was removed and reverted and incidentally those who removed them were invariably Muslims. Am I not allowed to put the two together and conclude that this is Islamic zealotry at work? OceanSplash13.Dec. 2005 18:20",0.0
""":Redthoreau, your contribution above in this section was highly interesting and educational, and hence was very appreciated. I have accepted most of your reasoning and as a result have decided not to repeat my sins and leave this article alone. But this last paragraph of yours (on those three Wikipedia policies) is nothing else than a spanking. All I did was to try to involve a very notable editor, fluent in Spanish, and familiar with current Latin American affairs, into this small controversy. Whatever the motivation, 'altering' (that is, editing) a Wikipedia article by adding true content is an absolutely legitimate endeavor, hence deserving respect. Which reminds me of an old itch, the scandalous contrast between fact and opinion in this encyclopedia. In Wikipedia opinions (sustained by references, namely, by other's opinions) seem to be valued better than facts, an impression that is frequently reinforced by the language used in discussions like this one. I remind you of the small detail that you have still not addressed the Third item in my preliminary response: (sic)""""...the objective of having Wikipedia tell the truth, which doesn't appear to be among the most important objectives or goals of this Encyclopedia (if it is, I'd appreciate anyone's help and tell me about it).""""

The wording you quote is mine  the article as I found it back in July 2006 did indeed only talk about  open systems as an interoperability phenomenon, with the exception of one line:
 It can also be defined as a system that allows access by other systems, hence 'open' system.
So the article really wasn't talking about social synergy even before then  but I changed the wording precisely because I thought that aspect, although not in the scope of this article (in my opinion), was still worth discussing.  (What I had been thinking about when I did my edit was the MIT AI Lab systems that were available for open access via the ARPANET back in the late '70s / early '80s.)
I think it would be great if you could create an article to discuss the social aspect, maybe using your article as the foundation for it, and it could be linked to from this article and others.  But I still do think it's a different topic from open systems as covered on this page.",0.0

Whoa.  I really lost you here.  The affine space was only an analogy.  I do not want to construct something new, only show that there are two classes in common usage: Clifford ring (my name) and Clifford algebra; furthermore, that some inaccuracy occurs because they are not adequately distinguished.  All I'm saying is that there exists a class of objects (Clifford ring) in which no specific subspace is necessarily known as the generating vector space V.  You can hide the identity of the subspace V (and the grading) by """"mysterious relabelling"""".  But here is the point: this relabelling truly does hide which of the basis vectors span V; it is possible to form a product for every element in the ring, but impossible to identify the original subspace V used in the construction.  The quaternions are a ring isomorphic to Cℓ0,2(ℝ), which has a 1,2,1 grading structure.  Yet, given ℍ, can you find a unique decomposition with this grading structure?  No.  In a CA, grading specifically refers to a unique/natural decomposition into (I think it is into a direct sum of) 0-vectors, 1-vectors, 2-vectors etc.  talkcontr 19:22""",0.0

 Josephine Baker 

I'd like to ask that you review the talk portion of the sexuality section on Josephine Baker's page. My discussion went off on a tangent with Malik Shabazz when it really should have included you as well. The Jean Claude Baker book on Josephine Baker seems biased and unacceptable. For example, he states at the beginning that he """"hated her"""" and refers to himself eighteen times on the first page. Since he did not meet her until she was 52 it seems inappropriate to rely on his claims about her life when she was 20 or 30. The blanket statement """"Baker was bisexual,"""" written as if it indisputable, really has to go, don't you think? There is no evidence given except the claim of a fan who changed his name to hitch onto her celebrity. Doesn't this kind of TMZ gossip presented as fact diminish the biographies of people who have the courage to acknowledge their sexuality up front?209.212.5.67  """,0.0

The lead vocals are by Mick Jagger and The Chieftens.  Originally they were performed by Bono, but were not used.  These had been recorded at Windmill Lane.

I don't think the definition from Webbs really works given the change that has happened since it was first written (1917) . The idea that professionals """"supply disinterested counsel and service to others, for a direct and definite compensation, wholly apart from expectation of other business gain"""" is a bit naive, particularly in the I think a more realistic and up to date defintion is required.

 I have emailed you with a precise answer to your question. But for other wikipedians:
 
 I hereby publicly certify that to the best of my knowledge I have not been the sock puppet of MyronWyn,  
 Loren Dillman, TheScienceGuy, Lars Koenig or Mirondella.

 [In my future writings on the Lamé equation and uniformization, I hope that I might become the sock puppet of Felix Klein.] My personal connection with the Evans affair is the same as yours, but perhaps less so -)

 There is nothing underhanded in adding references to mathscinet and UNCC documents that Evans himself made publicly available. Both these references speak volumes.

 I am very glad that Evans' wikipedia page has been reduced to a stub. In its present form, however, the statements presented there cannot be verified by a wikipedia reader. Some link to the historical notes on the aias website seems necessary to make these statements verifiable. 

 I cannot understand why there are wikipedia pages on scientific cranks. However if these pages exist, the crankery should be made immediately apparent. I think my additions to this page have been: the mathscinet references which exposed the crankery; pointing out that the University of Glamorgan is a former polytechnic with no prowess in pure science; that Evans got himself fired from UNCC; and his invention of the idiotic term """"Cartan geometry"""".

It is indeed necessary to define free will and it is easy. I think it is a big mistake to announce that """"This article covers the non-theological aspects of free will"""" as the root of the concept is at least partly theological.

Then warn the reader that a perrenial source of confusion has been about the (apparent) randomness or non-determination in human choices and that this point will be adressed seperately because both """"aspects"""" of free will are (apparently) at odds.
Then, maybe after some historical notes introduce compatibilits' (at least Hume-like) free will  the ability to choose in agreement to one's principles (or main goals).

In his ludicrous block against me Jdorney wrote the following """"Regarding the Irish Republican pages, this user pushes a POV agenda talking up the IRA's military effectiveness. He does this by inflating the casualty figures listed. He has used several methods to do this. Firstly, by changing the numbers given by sourced material, thereby falsifying it. Secondly, by inventing sources and or/citing them falsely. He refuses to engage with other users when asked detailed questions about this behaviour, but instead makes personal attacks (specifically calling users loyalist paramilitary supporters) and threatens to get other editors banned from wikipedia. This behaviour has been going on for nearly a year now and is hugely disruptive to the articles in question. This is not only due to the factual inaccuracies and POV he inserts, but also because his reverts delete all the work done on the articles since his previous edits. Additionally, his constant reverts have had the effect of re-posting copyrgiht material that had been removed. Finally, Devin79 has also defamed a living person, Irish journalist Henry McDonald, although he has not engaged in revert wars there when his edits were removed. Jdorney 

The most serious aspect of this dispute, in my opinion, is edits such as [2]. Devin79 alters properly cited figures (from BBC News [3]) about the Provisional IRA's weapons arsenal. This change was made not only without providing a reference for the different numbers, but without changing the reference itself. So the article was left in a highly unsatisfactory state where it contradicted its own references, and this has been done several times over the past few months [4] [5]. Not only has Devin79 not responded to attempts by myself and other editors to engage with him on the talk page [6], but he announced his intention to keep on reverting regardless [7]. Demiurge 

These accusations are completely false, and slanderous. Every single edit I have done of the PIRA article is based on a number of sources all of which have been cited in the article edits, and source page. Jdorney has infested this article with innacuracies and outright lies, due to his biasd view of the IRA. The edits I made are proven and the proof was cited again and again. I even gave him specific information on how to find this info, which not surprisingly he ignored. Jdorney is an arrogant little punk, he has no idea what makes a good article and is an example of why Wikipedia is ridiculed in academic circles. I have access to several other IP addresses, and I will be using them to continue to edit the sad, amateurish work of this biased little loser. 

All of the above is also relevant to Jdorney's girlfriend SWATJester. SWATJester wouldn't know anything about the SAD if it slapped him upside the head. Having served 4 years as a Force Recon Marine, I would argue that I am far more knoweldgeable about this particular subject then some basement dweller who runs around calling himself """"SwatJester"""".

Look, here's the deal: this website may be a reliable source for the radio frequencies used by some airports in the UK, but it certainly doesn't back up the sweeping generalizations that have been attributed to it recently. I'm assuming that someone confused the nicknames of the sources or something, so I've gone ahead and replaced most citations to that article with  tags in the hope that those people actively seeking out sources will correct their mistakes swiftly.

 Origin 
The evidence presented by the following paragraph does not convince me of the relation between the Orkhon script and the Rovás. I've heard that conclusion elsewhere, and I'm not necessarily doubting it, but I just don't see proof from the arguments made here:
""""Around 600 AD, the yet illiterate Hungarian tribes moved southwest from their earlier territories to the coastal region of the Eastern Black Sea. The Hungarian Runes are almost certainly related to the Orkhon or Turkic Runic script. 

Says who? 

""""This is supported by the Hungarian tribes' early geography propinquity [Is this supposed to be """"proximity?""""] to the Göktürks.""""

So what? At various times in history they were near Germanic, Slavic, Turkic, Mongolic, and maybe Greek peoples. It doesn't follow, from the evidence presented that the Turkic influence was the source of the writing.

""""Moreover, thirteen of the Hungarian rovás glyphs closely resemble characters of the Orkhon script.

Which ones? I don't count 13 convergences. I see a lot of resemblance in overall appearance between Futhark and Rovás; they seem to show a greater resemblance to each other than with Orkhon. Some prominent features of the Orkhon script are absent in Rovás, e.g. reduplicated characters, and the use of dots or other small characters detached from the main sign.

I'm not arguing that German Runes and Rovás are necessarily closely related; it's just that the evidence presented by this section of this article is hardly convincing. If someone can correct this, please do.  !""",0.0

New Heading - Opposition to circumcision

The genital integrity movement relates to an individual's rights to choose for himself. But this is only a recent phenomenon and there are many other reasons people have opposed circumcision in history which cannot be listed under this heading.  So i thimk this is a broader topic heading which means that the opposition to circumcison to circumcision in days gone by can properly be outlined.

Radiant barriers (a white roof) can reflect much of this energy away even before it reaches a conductive insulator.  However, if you place foam directly directly in contact under a dark roof much of that solar radiation is not reflected but will conduct inward and result in high surface temperature at the foam.  Even at good R values the underside surface temperature of the foam can be still quite significant - and the energy re-radiated downward on to the ceiling.  However, the article does not consider the effect of a white roof to reflect most the energy away and then spray foam below the much cooler roof to deal with the rest of the heat energy.",0.0

"I kinda liked the changes made by anon. But we can consider them later. I collapsed the template.

I did check out the article on Kaziranga National Park. I learned something new: the Main article link is indeed useful, but in a very specific circumstance: when there is an article already in existence that directly enlarges the subsection in question. For example, the subsection on Fauna is linked to a larger and more detailed article on the fauna of this national park. Another example is the article on Buckingham Palace. The subsection on The Garden and the Mews has a Main link to an article specifically dealing with the Buckingham Palace garden. In Sustainability, this is not the case, and there is often redundancy: for example, Main link points to acid rain and climate change when in fact that subsection already has those articles embedded in the text. 

The book is Principles of Sustainability, by Simon Dresner, 2002. The paperback is coming next month, but the hardback should be easy to get thru the library. I took a peek via Amazon, and it looks like most of the book is a very detailed history of the concept. It appears that it was actually the World Council of Churches that originated the term.",0.0

"""Those sections were incredibly huge and unwieldy. They needed to be trimmed. A large swath was removed. The burden of proof should be on the person re-introducing them. We can't just add in everything that might be tangentially related to the ZGM. For practical purposes it was just too huge and of no use to our readers. Pic the top absolutely most important and go with those. 

In regards BSD and Anarchism and issues related to love and sex, those are far too tangential. If someone at one time asked a question about Jacques Cartier, does that mean we should have a link for him under see also? And remember, this article is not about a RBE. It's about the TZM's advocacy of a RBE. There's a huge difference. Criticism sections should be about TGM and their views. Not about the larger issues they bring up. This is the same as any other page. For instance, a religious organization could have a """"criticism"""" sections and include anything that might potentially fall under the broader discussions relating to religion (which could be a lot of things). Same thing goes for Further Reading. If there's a book or article dealing with TGM, then add them. Adding sources that just talk about RBE or broader social or economic issues is too broad.

Tsuki no Misaki
Tsuki no Misaki will become an article with enormous quantity.

""""will"""" is simple future, used to express certainty:
Example: The sun will rise tomorrow
 
That is not certain here. More correctly
Tsuki no Misaki should become an article with enormous quantity. (that which you think is proper)
Tsuki no Misaki may become an article with enormous quantity. (that which you think is possible)
Tsuki no Misaki could become an article with enormous quantity. (that which you think is possible)
Tsuki no Misaki probably will become an article with enormous quantity. (that which you think is strongly possible, but not inevitable)

""""Enormous"""" is usually used for physical things and/or things which are larger than normal or too large:
Humpback whales are enormous mammals.
Global warming is an enormous problem.

Equally important, mere size is not the issue, since Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate (unsorted, unorganized) collection of information. Quality counts, since an encyclopedia is a digest  a summary  of information on topics.

The area may deserve an article: it does NOT deserve a block-by-block and street-by-street description of the entire chome, especially since there is NO organizational principle holding them together. Any reader from outside Tokyo  any reader outside that neighborhood, in fact  will NOT understand in the slightest how any part fits in with any other part.

Westside
You recently deleted my article on Westside, because it was not """"verifiable"""". You said that I needed to have Westside reviewed by newspapers, or something along those lines. My problem with this is that it is not a, um, well known publication, and as such would not likely be reviewed by any newspapers or such. Is there anything I can do (or in other words, what kind of external sources do I need?) to get my article back on Wikipedia? How can I get somebody that you define as reliable to verify that Westside, umm, exists? It just doesn't seem fair that I can't write an article about Westside just because the New York Times doesn't write about it. I thought the purpose of Wikipedia was to make information available to anyone who wants it. Several of Westside's readers have approached Wyatt (the co-creator) about a website to learn more about it, and, as of yet, he has no website to point them to. When he asked me to create a site about it (he's not great with these things) I of course immediately thought """"What better than Wikipedia?"""" Unfortunately, I wasn't aware of the difficulty of putting a simple article up on Wikipedia. I won't deny that this has made me very angry. Is there ANY way for me to get my article back up? There's pretty much no chance that anything like a newspaper will cite Westside. Is there some kind of other source that I can get to review Westside? Also, why was my article initially cited as an attack article? It seemed obvious to me that my description of Tucker and Jason were not in any way insulting, as their apparent lack of intelligence is a character trait. Thanks in advance for your response.""",0.0

A small edit: In the “Reception” section (formerly “Dickinson and Her Critics”), Susanne Juhasz is paraphrased as offering essays from a “female"""" perspective (from her book Feminist Critics Read Emily Dickinson). Historically speaking, I wasn’t aware there was a “female” outlook on any matter. I’ve never doubted there was a “feminist perspective”, however. 

If a “female” point-of-view has been established as biologically - or socially - predetermined, kindly provide the scientific evidence for this phenomenon. Until then, I’ve changed the entry to “a feminist perspective.”

Watch iDia de los Dangerous!, I guarantee you they name the move at least five times during the event. The fact that Ultimo Dragon uses the name for a different move doesn't matter. For example, in wrestling, for years and years, the name """"Last Call"""" was synonymous with a fallaway slam, but that didn't stop TNA from giving that SAME name to a superkick. Sometimes two different moves have the same name.

(b Grisone [Grizane], Croatia, 1498; d Rome, 3 Jan 1578). Italian painter and illuminator of Croatian birth. The most important illuminator of the 16th century, he was a 'Michelangelo of small works', according to Vasari. Many of his documented works are dispersed or untraced, and some attributions are controversial, but his secure oeuvre gives a clear idea of his stylistic influences and development. Although much of his inspiration came from Raphael and Michelangelo, he developed his own visual language, brilliantly translating their monumental forms for work on the smallest scale.

Ah, so now you spring your little argument youve been itching for a while to do. In otherwords, 'How can Wikipedia support the supernatural claims in the Bible, and not those in my particular brand new religion.' 

First of all, Wikipedia doesnt support anything. Articles are to be written NPOV - that doesnt mean that articles dont ever use Biblespeak, rather when it is used, its used in proper context: """"In the Bible, etc. etc."""" 
This is not the Schucmanism Encyclopedia. Even if the claim that Jesus wrote the thing was universal among Christians, this is not the Christian Encyclopedia.  

Im not particularly attached to the term ghostwriting, but your wording - that [whatever it was called] is like channeling, etc - was not neutral, and placed too much emphasis on a trivial matter - trivial, because supernatural claims, despite our understanding of them in faith, are not encyclopedically substantive. 
This is of course the problem with religion - a little knowledge is a dangerous thing, and a lot of knowledge of just one thing is just plain dogma. You seem to be asserting that there is a dogmatic bias in wikipedia regarding the Bible. Its interesting, but you need to poing out specific examples, and then you need to deal with them on a case by case basis. Maybe you have a point here - I cant tell ATP. Dont forget """"the log in your own"""" BTW.

Its obviously a very touchy subject, but we deal from time to time with people seeking to push a POV in their writing, and after a while they realize that theyve already added all the information necessary to the article, but leave the writing to others. Its an important distinction - I myself have a couple times had to defer to others sometimes in cases where a conflict arose between two different POV writing styles. The question is: are yours and mine different enought to require outside help in resolving any dispute. Finally, """"Ill let you..."""" doesnt work here - its not your article, though you have had more part than anyone in developing it. And I was simply rewriting it for sake of neutral tone - something which you should welcome, not reject - as it legitimizes and adds to your work, just as your work adds to the project.

"List of Mad Magazine issues 

Hi . Thanks for your recent improvement to this article. Collectonian's point is surely that keeping a list article with the combined tables of contents of all the issues is an honor that we accord to very few magazines. I personally believe that it's justified in the case of Mad, because famous publications deserve more coverage than obscure ones. Irrespective of Collectonian's particular viewpoint, a high-quality list article with lots of references is easier to defend against future requests for its deletion. I haven't studied this one enough to know how it could be improved, but I think your new intro is a step in the right direction. I hope to post again on the Talk but haven't had the time yet. 

You are one the of the people who I was hoping to get the attention of, because I think only someone familiar with the magazine would have good ideas for how to improve this article.  I read the magazine when I was a kid, but have no idea of how to explain its cultural significance.

"""::: Simple solution. Rename the article to """"Dhimmi, according to Bat Ye'or and Bernard Lewis"""". The article is overburdened with the views of a handful of orientalists. In addition to that, as Tony points out, the article is effectively a series of polemic statements deriding the historic practices that occured under the Dhimmi system. If this article isn't a commentary (and POV-driven indictment) on history, then there's the burden to prove that Shariah as practiced today also supports the kinds of restrictions on dhimma that the article claims it to. Sections discussing history should make it clear that their content is historical, and should not contrast events and policies practiced in the 8th or 10th century with standards we accept today. Sections dealing with contemporary usage of dhimma in countries that run under Shariah should make it clear what aspects of the dhimmi system are still being practiced.

no content
an infobox can be  contentthe one on Keenan Davis  just needs rewriting in sentences. Please check WP:CSD for the actual criteria for speedy deletion. '''''' ( talk ) 

Generally, a biography should have content about biographical information on the subject (not just player stats). Statistical information, such as date and place of birth, information on historical significance (N/A here), pictures, and information on accomplishments is usually accepted as the content of a biography on Wikipedia. What we have here are some of Keenan Davis' NFL stats. The page should be written from his childhood/early years up to how he got into the NFL and what he did to get there (such as being in minor leagues), like any normal biography.

I understand your point on how infoboxes can be content, but in this situation what we have is a biography with just NFL stats. How can we consider that a biography?   

 A1/A3 tag for NBEO 

Hey, MrScorch, I just wanted to let you know that I declined your CSD nomination of the NBEO article.  You nominated it under A1 (no context) and A3 (no content), but the article isn't really that close to meeting either criterion; it's pretty clear what the subject of the article is, and it isn't actually empty.  If there are other reasons to delete it (there certainly may be), feel free to bring it up at AfD, but just having little content or no references isn't enough for CSD on its own. Thanks,  ⚇♔

For willmcw

I think its high time you stopped trying to rearrange my words. The information contained on the biff rose site colelcts the pertinent info. It is not a billboard for his achievements, but an overview of his career. I think records that were pressed and sold are of worth. Ones that were not around in copies more than fifty or a hundred are not. I've interviewed Rose, I know which ones sold and which ones didn't. You can beef up a discog with murky details, but it won't help the whole wiki crowd. Stop being bullheaded, and agressive, because though you've been given power through edits, you have also become that which you supposedly fight against. You are not allowing the newer versions of this piece to come to life, but instead are so closely guarding the information disseminated from within that you have become like a fascist. Terrible!!!

[left unsigned by user:Steve espinola at ]

Why do you delete the number of """"Carson"""" appearances? Why are you deleting the name of his biggest song? What does it matter to you if the records sold 10 or 10,000 copies? Do you have some personal animus towards Rose? Please note that your personal feelings, and your personally-obtained interviews, should not be used to influence the article. It's a biography, and should present a comprehensive picture of his life. It's not a place to gain revenge on someone you don't like. -Willmcw 20:21, August 6, 2005 (UTC)

Any info deleted was moved from prominence to more esoteric reading of it, to make the article read better, and have a decent flow. That Rose was in Time magazine once in 1965 is not of note. That he wrote a song that was covered by both Tiny Tim and David Bowie is. That that song was co written Oscar winning musician Paul Williams is important. Also of note, it should be mentioned that Rose has disavowed the Williams connection in several interviews, until in late 2004 on his own website's message board he admitted he was falsefying William's own involvement in the song. But a small 200 word blurb in time 50 years ago is not of worth. As for Rose's appearnaces on Carson, there has been no reall connection with the amount of times Rose officia",0.0

 Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Cheongye Kwan 

Your post at the above AFD on a new martial art bothers me. This was the version at the time, that you based your post on. You posted:

 """"I just read the article, and to be quite honest, feel that it does satisfy Wikipedia's guidelines... it is reliably sourced... Since I believe the notability of the article is satisfied... It now has 11 independent sources. And to refute the argument posed by Wayne, it is determined by the Phillip Rhee source that the martial arts is not localised"""".

Please consider the concerns this post raises. Simple matters like references, notability and noobie basics of AFDs should be routine for any moderately experienced user, and bread-and-butter for any admin. In fact a cursory check shows that almost everything you stated was.. I don't have a word for it. """"Unreal"""" is close.

The """"eleven independent sources"""" that you stated established notability and non-localization at the time, were:
 Three references from 2004 [coates, robinson, shaw], certainly before the topic even existed (!) and all related to a passing piece of news about its founder being on the team of a completely different sport in any event (!)
 Two references from 1st half 2005 [davies, white], almost certainly identical and identically irrelevant to the topic's notability.
 The promoter's personal page on his local town website, almost certainly self-published [official village website].
 A 2008 casual interview in a non-notable and possibly non-reliable university magazine (apparently) of the promoter's travels to see experts in a different sport, with tangential tiny (< 1 sentence) mention that he'd discussed his new sport with them too. [ the Lau Philip """"LA"""" interview].
 3 entries marked """"Reference and support of , Written Reference"""" [chris, cook, rhee], obviously a request by the founder to a friend/colleague write a letter of support, that was never published anyway and isn't cited so you can't have read it (not that it was even possibly valid evidence).
 A short writeup of a """"local information"""" kind, on the award of the first 4 black belts by the school, in its local paper.

In brief of the 11:
 5 were before the sport existed and were not even remotely to do with the topic itself much less """"sourced"""" material on it or """"substantial"""" coverage (they had precisely zero coverage); 
 3 were claims of personal """"I think  is a great guy"""" letters of support, evidently solicited and/or written on request, with zero evidence of verifiable existence, and certainly in no way reliably sourced or independent; 
 1 was self-written
 1 was the briefest of non-mentions in a non-reliable source (pretty much """"I discussed the topic with them"""" in a college magazine interview)
 1 is local press coverage of his courses that's not even """"news for a day""""  or evidence of anything beyond """"a course by this name is taught twice weekly in our local village hall"""".

Your assessment of these, at AFD, was:
 It is reliably sourced
{| style=""""border:#c0c0c0 solid 1px"""" width=""""90%""""
| 
 There is barely one reliable source in all of those 11 that the sport even exists in the first place (!) - a local newspaper mention that it meets in a village hall on tuesdays and fridays and just awarded its first 4 black belts. Probably via self-promotional input. 
 There is zero reliable sourcing for any of the rest.

"I agree that we should be representing the sources, if the source says that a Palestinian medic said such and such we should say the same. But it goes both ways, just as we should not assume that everything a Palestinian source says about this is true, we should not assume as Israeli sources. If the IDF says that there were shot fired from a location, we should say that 'The IDF says . . .' or if the foreign ministry says such and such, we should say 'the Isreali MFA says.' As far as the Israeli officer goes, Ill keep the faith, and im proud of you that you didnt fire a shot too ). But while I don't assume that Israeli soldiers never target civilians with intent, I likewise dont assume that they never do. I have seen too many videos of Israeli soldiers behaving in a brutal matter to Palestinians who are already on their knees with their hands up to think that it never happens.  And likewise I dont think that a pilot fires on a building with civilians knowing it is full of them and only them, but I dont that their superiors would never order it without their knowledge.  Atrocities happen, oftentimes unintentionally, others with full intent, like My Lai Massacre, Sabra and Shatila massacre for which high ranking officers were held at least indirectly responsible, and many others.

 Michael Jackson 

About the new song, I'm not going to debate you about this because there shouldn't been any doubt in a few days. But I think you're being far, far too strict in your inclusion of information here. We don't have an exact confirmation by Michael Jackson that he sang the song. That's because, as far as I know, there wasn't much doubt. A singer is not going to release a statement """"Hey I sang this song"""" everytime a song that is suspected to be his is leaked. I doubt any singer will do that, much less Michael Jackson. And if Billboard Magazine and MTV news could confidently claim that it is sang by Michael Jackson, there is no doubt whatsoever. This similar reasoning should be applied to other things as well. Wikipedia relies on sources only when common sense does not suffice. We don't need exact statements on everything to merit their inclusion or notability.

Your response confirms to me that you have obviously sided with the other users who attacked me. Perhaps Users such as Blixx are good friends of yours.

I find it astounding that you have gone to great lengths to supress my views by blocking me from editing, blocking me from contacting the head as well as yourself and for added measure you have blocked me from emailing. All because I complained about my treatment, lets face it the excuse about me edit warring is just a smokescreen, you just don't like it when I diagree with a point of view.

 MediaWiki:Duplicate-defaultsort 

Do you realize what a wonderful thing this is?  When you created it eight weeks ago was it your intention to address the conflict that pupped up in the category it created?  I hope not because I have been, although if you want to jump in and take care of the ones under """"S"""" and """"T"""" while I finish """"L"""" and do """"M"""" through """"R"""" I will not complain.

When I stumbled across the category there were 2,777 pages in it.  By the end of today there will be fewer than 1,000.  My goal is to get all the non-trivial items resolved by the end of next week so I can start on the pages in Category:Biography articles without listas parameter, a project that should keep me out of trouble for the rest of my life.  

Because I am resolving the conflicts in the first category I have learned more about how banners work than probably anyone else except the folks, like you, who know why the banners work as they do.  I have also leaned what items can set the DEFAULTSORT. As an added bonus I have leaned a couple of keyboard shortcuts I did not know before and I have become almost addicted to Preview.

The absolutely best part about the Dup-DS is that the category it has created, that I will continue to monitor on a daily basis, is a safety net for me when I mess something up on a page in  Category:Biography articles without listas parameter.  The easiest error to make is for me to neglect to put a listas value in a template that uses it, wants it, and will throw a fit if it is not there.

Thank you!

 Vietnam War is NOT genocide 

Genocide is the deliberate killing of a certain religious, ethnic, or national group. The Vietnam War was never a deliberate and systematic killing of any religious, ethnic or national group. Using Agent Orange is not genocide, because genocide must be deliberate. Agent Orange's purpose was to destroy crops and trees. The human side-effects were not fully understood at the time.

I have removed the Agent Orange part, in addition to this part:
""""A film called U.S. Techniques of Genocide in Vietnam describes the use of elaborate U.S. weapons against civilian targets in Vietnam such as anti-personnel weapons designed to kill human targets while causing minimal damage to buildings, steel pellet bombs that zigzag in all directions and the internationally banned dum-dum bullet.http://jonestream.blogspot.com/2010/05/vietnam-united-states-agent-orange.html""""

When I saw the edits and MPLX's addition yesterday, I found it rather anti-GWB (which I happen to share, but...) POV and unfounded. The connection seems absurdly weak and tenuous; for decades if not centuries politicians all the world over have been speaking of peace while waging or preparing war, and assuring the populace that it is a just war to bring a better tomorrow for everybody (in my country, we have rich experience with """"fighting for peace"""").
So, first of all, I don't think the speech was particularly paradoxical, let alone """"[[Orwellian]"""" - although I don't follow the US media; if MLPX can provide links of other commentators noting this, he has a case in point.
Secondly, even if the speech was meant to explicitly refer to FDR's Four Freedoms, I think that the mediated connection to 1984 is too loose and willed for an encyclopedia.
Thirdly and most importantly, even if the section had a place in the article, it's certainly not squat in the middle of the section """"The World of 1984"""". Move it down among late references, if it must be kept (and I agree with Alavery7 that it concerns more the speech than the novel so it should be better moved there).

Dennis, I'd really love to hear an answer as to why my Coal edits are relevant here. I've stopped editing coal, and this consitutesDouble Jeopardy since I've already been punished for this and have done nothing since then. 

Dan is also missspeaking when he says there were 4 blocks, there were 3, and one """"change of block settings"""".

Obviously my edits have improved from my first week at the encylopedia, but I keep getting unloaded on for my youthful indiscretions. Also, Flyer22 has been following me around reverting my edits since I first did her the indignity of adding a minor, brief, referenced note on Sigmund Freud's theories to her beloved childhood page, which has little to no useful philosophical material, and yet is classed as a high importance, low quality philosophy, with begging for improvement (""""If you can improve this page, please do so. It has little or no material"""") then afterwards, she began to follow me around to other philosophy pages, and reverting my work with dishonest comments in the edit summary given as reasons. Yes, I did get annoyed at this, but I think it was rather uncivil to tell a new editor that their edits are """"poor, pure and simple"""" don't you? Especially when she doesn't seem to actually posssess any abiding interest in the topics I edit other than the fact that they are my topics, and she wishes to see me be annoyed and removed from editing this website?

 I am encouraged by your feedback.  Let me clear it up a bit first: my version is written basically with Paul Graham's article on this topic in my mind.  I think that article is neither an undue appraisal nor an unfair dismissal of the term, and I think it would be a good and neutral starting point for me when I re-write the lead.
 According to that article, Web 2.0 can be boiled down into three things: democracy, Ajax, and focus on user.  This is how I structure the lead sentence: democracy (ie architecture of participation in Tim O'Reilly's words, and folksonomy in realisation) and user focus in the first part, and better UI powered with Ajax in the second.
 Specific replies as follows:
 lengthy list: agree, although the current version also features a long list as well.  Perhaps we can break down that clause into two, like this:
 ... that put emphasis on allowing users to share and collaborate information online in new ways as part of the service, presented in a user-friendly, interactive, and often Ajax-enabled, user interface.
 """"collaborate information"""": my wrong.  Let's preserve the order in the current version, ie """"collaborate and share information"""".
 folksonomy: see my point re: democracy and architecture of participation above.  I do believe that this is an important feature that distinguish Web 2.0 from the old: a platform, built-in as part of the service, that allows users to actively contribute to the grouping and ranking of contents.  You won't have that pre-Web 2.0.  Even the readers' ranking at Amazon.com was initially a secondary feature.
 cluttering the lead: please see if the revised version above would make it better presented.  And as I have mentioned above, the original version suffers from the same problem as well.
 focus on what web 2.0 is: I believe this is what I am doing with the revised version.  The current version simply mentions too much of O'Reilly Media, but the term has evolved far beyond their reach and control.  And I do believe the revised version does sufficiently address the fact that it has become a buzzword in the marketing sense.   """,0.0

In my own defense: A man has a right to his opinion. I do feel Timothy Usher is a bigot. I do feel that Jews are screwing up the planet (though admittedly Muslims, by far, surpass the Jews in their capacity to destroy things). Look at history. Only recently has it become the norm to like Jews. That only came about after certain countries (eg America) adopted them as the collective dame-in-distress needing shelter and protection. Sort of the precursor to the chihuahua. Before then, Jews were hated in Europe and America alike..And everywhere else. We all know Jews were once banished from most culturally superior European countries. The only reason why Poland took them in was that they had loads of money. Probably the same reason why Washington panders to the now. Point is, alot of people dislike Jews. I'm entitled to, so long as I don't demonstrate that dislike on articles dealing with the topic of Jews. We don't penalize people for not liking things, do we? His Excellency...

But I also read what you wrote before that and it is obvious you're trying to cover up your arrogant attitude despite your obvious ignorance of basic facts: """"Until you can produce a reliable linguistic source that has conducted more recent linguistic surveys in northern Greece, then Ethnologue is the most recent, most reliable source."""" and then """"I'm not sure what the """"howler"""" is at the link to Macedonian that you provided."""" and then """"If you have an exact reference to it then use it to edit the number in the article (and include the reference) since it looks like a more recent survey. I'm not wedded to Ethnologue or its number, but it just required a reliable source with a new number to supplant the only other reliable source available."""" Even after FPS (for Pete's sake not some pesky Greek nationalist with a POV agenda) explains more than once that there was no census in 1986 and that Ethnologue's number is bogus you insist on talking about """"more recent"""" and """"only other reliable"""". So if Britanica (a far more serious outfit than Ethnologue) claimed that Greece had a population of 20 million according to the 1986 census you'd call that reliable even though it is an obvious error (both the magnitude of the number as well as the year of the census)?

This whole conversation is rediculous as the colors on a flag are meant to represent different ideas or ideals. What we decide to call that color has everything to do with what is meant by that color. By calling it yellow one is neglecting to fully appreciate the meaning behind the choice of gold as a flag color is meant to convey an idea, that of eternal and original wealth and prosperity. It has nothing to do with being high and mighty regarding the naming of a color. That is a reactionary and frankly stupid position to hold. Flags are symbols meant to illustrate various ideas and they use images and colors, like all other forms of symbolism, to do this.

Answere:- No I have not supported lotsd of groups. I have only supported the CPW , AWP (formally known as the NCPA). I was never a member of the People's Think Tank Association plus the PTTA never had a president. Plus I have only ever been one person. And that person is Peter Watson. This nazi must have a lot of time on his hands to look for information on me. So I can only come up with only one conclusion and that is simply that this man has no social or sex life. So I can only say on thing """"go get a life man and get a women"""".

Peter was President of the """"People's Think Tank Association"""" based in Warwick, which he says """"split from the Communist Party of Australia just recently and they publish the Caller""""

Answere:- I was never the president of the PTTA. The PTTA was never ever created. The Caller was a fake news paper. As fare as I know it was only ever printed once by some nazi. Since the PTTA was never realy so how cna it split from the CPA. So many questions and not enough answeres. The man just doesn't have a life.

Peter was """"President of the New Communist Party of Australia"""" and """"Chairman of the Central Committee"""" (this is in his Communist International News)

Answere:- I was the president but not the had of the NCPA. I was the chairman of the central commitee. But as you might know the NCPA and the AWP are the same group. The AWP change its name to NCPA but change it's name back soon after remember you stupid nazi.

Peter was """"President of the Communist Party of Warwick""""

Answere:- Only for a short number of times in the hsitory fot he party that I was the presidnet of it.

Peter also says: """"the New Communist Party of Australia (NCPA) , The People Think Tank Association (PTTA) and the Communist Socialist Workers Front (CSWF) did dissolve and absorbed into the Australia First Party (AFP)"""".

Answere:- The Communist Socialist Worker's Front never ever was created and never was real. It just goes to show that nazis just makes things up to help them selvs. The PTTA was never real. If you are aksing why I made the CSWF and the PTTA up well it was just for fun.

Peter has also set up the """"Australian Worker's Party""""

Answere:- This nazi (FairDinkum) is a idiot. I have said this many times that it was started in april was a split from the CPW that changed it's name to NCPA than change it's name back to AWP when it was kicked out fo the AFP. Not only are nazis stupid like FairDinkum but they also don't listen.

I am a Communist and believe in Marxist-Leninism. I am not retarted. Plus I am not troubled person or retarted. I have never said in my life that I was the king of the Communists or the Nazis.

"The criticism from Clive James is not a critique of Ashbery so much as it is about the poetry establishment or poetry industry. James is saying that it converts promising poets like Ashbery into product factories, and that the product is deemed by the establishment to be amenable to further reshaping by the industry to suit its purposes. That's what James says, but what he is getting at, is praise for Ashbery, rather than the negative that was suggested above by Sighrik: that Ashbery could have produced more great stuff if he had not been so converted by the industry. I would say that this is an important piece of criticism on Ashbery, to the extent that those who consider themselves to be working outside the industry (oddly, this includes many university professors) have come to view Ashbery as something less than the real thing, or that he became part of the established industry because he was not a true innovator. James's suggestion is that the conventional university attitude toward Ashbery is not fair or accurate. Even though it is a bit roundabout, I would put the James critique back in the article.",0.0

24.243.187.152 has committed a mild amount of vandalism on The Andy Milonakis Show. It appears that he was attempting to make a joke, but after other users have reverted him, I left him a vandalism warning. He has only made one vandalistic edit since then.

Hi, in the above article, you claim that Ken Livingstone repeated allegations by Fred Holroyd of a plot against Harold Wilson. I haven't read Holroyd's book, but I have read secondhand accounts of his allegations (and the New Statesman articles by Duncan Campbell that broke the story) and I recall that they didn't relate to plots against Harold Wilson, but more towards Army collusion with Loyalist paramilitaries and sundry dirty tricks of that nature. Are you perhaps thinking of the entirely seperate Colin Wallace/Clockwork Orange allegations that came out at roughly the same time? I did pop a 'See Also' to Clockwork Orange already...  

Hi, I was unfamiliar with the Colin Wallace allegations.  I only came across Holroyd on the page for Holroyd I just included what was mentioned about Nairac (long speech), some of which I didnt photocopy. There was other stuff in his speech. The Nairac stuff quoted alludes to some of it, but I will post the other references below it: 
""""His complaint, which eventually led to his removal from the Army and an attempt to discredit him, which has been largely successful, was made when the MI6 operation was taken over by MI5 in 1975- 'by many of the same people who are dealt with in Peter Wright's book [Spycatcher], and many of the same people who are alleged to have ben practising treason against the elected Labour Government of the time'""""

""""It [Miami showband massacre] took place in the midst of the ceasefire that had been negotiated by the then Labor Government and the IRA.  The right hon member for morley and leeds, south (Mr.Rees) pushed it through and sustained it, although there was a considerable opposition from within the security services and within many political parties.  The Labour Government did everything possible to make the ceasefire work, but it was not wholly accepted within the appartus of MI5- our operatuves who alledegly were working on behalf of the British State in Northern Ireland.""""

then later in the speech Livingstone says:

We saw in last Sunday's edition of The Observer that another intelligence officer, Colin Wallace, who was closely linked with Fred Holroyd in a campaign to expose what was going on, has been dismissed as irrelevant by the British Government.  We see now that The Observer, using forensic tests, has been able to demonstrate that the notes that he wrote were not written in the past couple of years by somebody who is embittere and is trying to cash in on what has started to come out.""""

then later:

""""Wallace and Holroyd are making these quite specific allegations""""

That is all I have on it now, BUT I will check Holroyds book next week and see exactly what he alledges, then update on your talk page.  Hows that?  """,0.0

"Weak support:This came to my attention when I started in doing a disambiguation back when The Nation went to The Nation (disambiguation).  It is true (this is also said above) that the majority of links which went to The Nation (disambiguation) were meant to go to The Nation (U.S. periodical).  However, I found that in all the cases where this was not true (e.g. when the Irish or Thai periodical was meant) the editors of those articles seemed to not be aware of the U.S. periodical.  (This makes sense, incidentally, as this periodical is not entirely well known even in the U.S.)  In short, the old situation was that there were a ton of links to a disambiguation page, which is to be avoided, but in this new situation, I think we'll eventually see a ton of links to simply the wrong thing, which strikes me as worse.
Moreover, a remark:  although the majority of the inbound links were meant for the U.S. periodical, I think there is a systemic bias at work here.  A vast majority of those were in bibliographies, where a web article from The Nation was referenced.  Many (almost all?) sources in Wikipedia bibliographies are web-based, and thus we should not be surprised to see a current magazine overrepresented, especially when constrasted with a 19th century publication. 
But all in all, weak support in that I think the oppose position is also quite reasonable.  (Talk)",0.0

"This is total tripe!!  A bunch of brainwaahed, Glasweigian, nutters running down Goodison Rd does not prove a Catholic bias at EFC. Or, some loons in the Kop on a derby day.   Neither does Mr Baxter being a Catholic.  I doubt he knocked on the doors of catholic homes and goaded them to EFC.  Most people would not have heard of him.  The EFC committee was predominately Liberal and Houlding Tory being councillor.  Many of the EFC committee were in temperance societies, Houlding was a brewer and they viewed he wanted to sell his ales at Anfield - he wanted sole refreshments rights.  Houlding insisted the teams changed at his Sandon pub and walk to the ground.  Holding made money from this in sales. 

The split at EFC creating Liverpool was purely principles.  No religion at all.  Everton wanted a community based club with a spread of shares. Houlding wanted a few rich owners holding most of the shares - the corporate model which is still the same today.  Everton on going to Goodison Park issued 5,000 shares for the fans. EFC were the first to have a shareholders association and the meets are always in the Liverpool Echo.  Everton put the profits back into the club for the benefit of the fans, and by the 1930s had 4 double-decked stands, while Anfield was primitive in comparison because the owners creamed off - despite both clubs having about the same sized fanbase.  Anfield was only uprated in 1963 with the Kemlyn Rd stand, the rest being 1906 at the latest - two years later EFC were hosting a world cup semi-final, the difference was so marked.

Leeds University Study:-

Both of the city’s major clubs share a common origin. An Everton football club was established as a small chapel team in 1878, it became a founder member of the Football League in 1888, first won the championship in 1890-91, and at that time played its home matches at Anfield. By the early 1890s, however, the club was in serious difficulties, experiencing a traumatic internal schism that tore through its management and ownership and led to the creation of a second club.

The club’s main financial backer was Houlding, a prominent brewer and Tory politician but, amidst allegations of financial exploitation, in 1892 the majority of the club’s members abandoned the Anfield site, removed the club from Houlding’s control and set out for Goodison – in retaliation, Houlding incorporated a new club, Liverpool F.C, based at Anfield.

The story of the schism provides an important illustration of how far a successful professional football organization had become integrated into community identity and politics by the late Victorian period. In an early manifestation of today’s frictions between commercial backers and fans, the research shows that the intensity of the wrangling over the governance and ownership of the club bore witness to the importance, even at that early date, of perceptions of the club as a worthy political prize, as a means by which wealthy individuals could gain influence and prestige.

The historical dispute at Everton also emphasises significant contemporary perceptions of the role an iconic football club could play in moulding social behaviour. The owners and directors of the new Everton F.C. believed such an important social institution could be a bastion of ‘purity’, a model of Christian sobriety, of Nonconformist, Liberal ideals. In governance terms they sought to carry over the original ideal of a more democratic ‘members’ club’ into the era of incorporation.

Houlding, too, was well aware of the importance of a successful football club for community identity and involvement, but he believed a corporate structure based on a ‘modern’ business model (wherein investors had control and could expect a reasonable rate of return) was more appropriate. His behaviour at Everton F.C., and his subsequent success in establishing Liverpool F.C., reveal his attempts to weld together politics and sport in such a way as to wield influence in both, to help secure the support base for his brand of ‘Tory Democracy’.

However, the difficulties he encountered at Everton F.C. also show the strength of opposing political perceptions. The alternative Liberal vision of the sober artisan football supporter, closely involved in the affairs of his club through membership and diverse shareholdings, and wary of autocratic manipulations from the drinks trade, proved capable of wrenching Everton F.C. from Houlding’s control even if, after only a short time, he was able to establish a successful rival club.

Another feature of the schism was that it occurred within Protestant ranks for, despite the prominence often assigned to the role of sectarianism in Liverpool politics – and despite the political importance of Irish Home",0.0

Same applies to modern times. Not to mention that nomads did NOT develop the breed initially, because the breed was originally established by whoever was raising sheep or goats, while nomads were traveling, so they helped to spread it. As per fighting dogs of this breed in some countries, there is already a clear outline in this article already.   

However, there are factual materials that some of so-called """"fight test"""" aimed to measure the aggression towards strange unfriendly dogs or other large predators entering  protected premises. This applies to dogs of either gender. As well, there are several cases of successful re-introduction of dogs from kennels that run so-called """"fighting tests"""" to livestock guardians duties, in different countries. As well, the free range farming is on the rise in Russia, and the livestock guardian dogs are in demand. The pit-like dogs, pit mixes and commercial fights is one thing; the necessity to maintain aggression towards predators to protect the herd from strays is a totally different issue.

:This review is transcluded from Talk:Seekers (novel series)/GA1. The edit link for this section can be used to add comments to the review.

Reviewer: Hello, dear Derild! You might remember me from MOTD. This is a nice article, simply written, informative, and readable. ) I've done a quick see-through, though, and found a few okay, nitpicky, merciless person that I am, a bunch of concerns. Here they are!  talk 
 Seekers follows four young bear cubs: Kallik (a polar bear), Lusa (a black bear), Ujurak (a small grizzly bear who can change into any animal), and Toklo (a grizzly bear). I think """"...follows the adventures of..."""" might sound better.
 Dogs were considered but rejected because they were too close to cats in their hierarchal social organization, their pack and hunting lifestyles, and their territoriality. <""""their"""" is unnecessary in its second and third usage.
 The company wanted her to write another series on animals just not about cats. This sounds slightly awkward, maybe a comma or two will make it flow more smoothly.
 HarperCollins suggested dogs, but Holmes """"was reluctant...they guard their territories"""".. Direct quotes need direct references. The statement about HarperCollins suggesting dogs especially needs a reference because it's referred to in the introduction.
 """"the all-action excitement that the Erins love so much"""". Same here.
 the company then thought about horses knowing how Holmes also like them.. This sentence sounds a bit awkward, too (there's something grammatically incorrect in that sentence, methinks, but unfortunately, I'm too dumb to lay my finger on it myself).
 ...the main inspiration for the series is Inuit beliefs and the Native American languages The great grammar mystery..again.
 Lusa means black in Choctaw while Kallik means lightning or storm in Inuit.[2] Shouldn't Choctaw be linked to Choctaw language?
 However, even there, Ujurak, who leads the journey feels that they need to go further, into the Arctic. I think a comma after """"journey"""" might make the prose smoother.
 Seekers follows four young bear cubs: Kallik (a polar bear), Lusa (a black bear), Ujurak (a small grizzly bear who can change into any animal), and Toklo (a grizzly bear). Here, a serial comma is used, while in other examples such as Lusa, Kallik and Toklo and The Last Wilderness, Fire in the Sky and Spirits in the Stars. the extra comma is omitted. Either can be used, but it has to be consistent throughout the article.
 The """"First Series"""" section could be expanded quite a lot, I think (especially since the books don't get articles of their own yet).
 Children's Literature picked up the environmental theme, it also commented themes such as """"commented on"""" is probably better.
 approach - three bears mdash;, mdash;, otherwise you crash..
 """"She also cleverly deals with the theme of racism through a unique and honest approach - three bears of different color, different backgrounds and different beliefs turn to each other for survival and friendship""""
 Kirkus Review  thought """"Hunter creates a richly sensuous world filled with cruelty, beauty, tenderness, savagery and just enough underlying legendary background to add mystery""""; they also wrote that too much detail went into developing the characters and setting and there was very little plot.[7] At first they're complimenting the book, and then they're """"also"""" criticizing it. Maybe something along the lines of ...mystery""""; however, they criticized the weakness of the plot and the excessive detail in character development and setting.
 """"Other media"""" could simply be """"External links"""", no? )
All in all, this article has a solid base and good references, but it needs much improvement to get there. I'm sure thattyping like crazy waay after midnight and getting up in the morning with bleary, bloodshot eyes some good effort will benefit it greatly, though. Keep up the good work!

Would you give your consideration to signing this pledge from doc Glasgow. Thanks,  
Thank you for calling it to my attention.  Since this is my only account and it's easily linkable to my real name, I have no problem signing the pledge, though I would not support it as a mandatory rule for anyone other than myself.  Interesting concept, and I appreciate that you brought it to me.  It's something to think about, clearly.  - Philippe 

 Question 

I'm working on an article about the Old Stone House in one of my sandboxes. I stopped by the house a few days ago and picked up a brochure for research. Some of the info is not accessible online (or else I'm just not finding it) and I'm wondering how I reference a brochure. It was made by the National Park Service, so it's definitely a RS. Also, I laughed when I read your comment and I responded. Thanks.  yada yada 
 You said you'd never tell!    I think for citation purposes, I'd treat a brochure as a book (although, obviously) without the ISBN number.  Details are at Wikipedia:CITE#FULL.  To be sure, though, you might ask over at the WP:REFDESK, because I've never done that before.  - Philippe 
Ok, thanks. I use the HD alot, but the one time I used the RD I didn't get an answer. I'll try there again. [[User:AgnosticPreachersKid|APK",0.0

Your inability to admit facts in the face of overwhelming evidence

Well if the shoe fits and the logic lacks, then you are laughing at your own lack of logic in your previous and last contributions to the NWPL deletion page.

I note that you and other editors of Gatineau Park material are aviation enthusiasts...

     
 
- Sparks was founder of the park, researcher says,    
- By Dave Rogers, Ottawa Citizen, May 9, 2004, p. A9   
- Mackenzie King is often credited with founding the park, but an ex-journalist says Roderick Percy Sparks was the driving force, Dave Rogers reports.   
- The NCC has hired a pair of Outaouais historians to study the origins of Gatineau Park after it received information that contradicts the popular notion that William Lyon Mackenzie King was the father of the park.   
- The evidence, gathered by Chelsea resident and Senate speechwriter Jean-Paul Murray, suggests Roderick Percy Sparks played a far more influential role than the former prime minister in creating the park.   
- Mr. Sparks dedicated 25 years of his life to the creation of a national park in the Gatineau Hills and for 10 years was chairman of the Federal Woodlands Preservation League, a lobby group that encouraged the first government purchase of Gatineau Park.   
- During the 1930s, Mr. Sparks and other members of the league argued there should be a national park in the Gatineau Hills because the widespread cutting of trees for firewood endangered the area's scenic beauty. The government created Gatineau Park in 1938, but it is not a national park and has no legal protection as a park.   
- Mr. Sparks wrote the master plan for development of the park in 1952. The plan recommended that all private property in the area, including his home, be expropriated. Mr. Sparks' vacant house on Meech Lake Road in the park burned under mysterious circumstances in 2001 two months after Mr. Murray, the former managing editor of the federalist Cite libre magazine began asking questions about its owner.   
- There was no electricity or combustible material, other than the building itself, to create a fire risk, nor was there evidence of fire starting from the nearby woods.   
- No cause for the fire was ever made public. The police did not release a report and the report from the fire authorities was almost a blank. There was no cause, no suspects and no investigation.   
- An obituary on Mr. Sparks in the Ottawa Journal of March 30, 1959 called him the “father of the Gatineau Park,” adding that as chairman of the Federal Woodlands Preservation League, he “brought about the first purchase by the Dominion government of what is now the Gatineau Park.”   
- Born in 1880, where the Supreme Court of Canada stands today, Percy Sparks was the great grandnephew of Ottawa pioneer Nicholas Sparks. He played a leading role in the customs investigation that led to the King-Byng Affair and to the subsequent defeat of the Liberal government. Mr. Sparks' contemporaries generally acknowledged him as the park's founder.   
- “Percy Sparks was a giant who brought down Mackenzie King's government in 1926,” Mr. Murray said. """"He was the man who did more to create Gatineau Park than anybody else from lobbying to writing the first master plans.   
- Mr. Murray said Mr. King was cautious about the creation of the park. “I found an interesting passage in his diary from 1937, a few months before the park was created, that showed he wasn't enthusiastic about the park because people might think he was trying to improve his property.”   
- “The NCC says that he was one of the major architects of the park, but this disproves it.”   
- Mr. Murray said the NCC never mentioned Mr. Sparks' role in creating the park so people wouldn't be tempted to advocate it",0.0

Bolsheviks? Are you suggesting that i shouldn't forcefully challenge the proposed introduction of the topic of Bolsheviks into this article??? That's roughly equivalent to the old red-baiting practice of calling union organizers commies.

But that's just one of the obvious examples, and therefore easy to challenge. An example of the more subtle bias that has crept in  the article has been edited to claim,

Union Busting is a term used by labor organizations and trade unions to describe the activities that may be undertaken by employers, their proxies, workers and in certain instances states and governments usually triggered by events such as picketing, card check, organizing, and strike actions...

In other words, the workers begin to organize, or the union takes some sort of concrete action, and there is a response.

Well, (the reader may conclude,) if the union advocates would just go away, everything would be peachy-keen.

But that doesn't hint at the reality faced by some of my friends and family who have worked at Wal-Mart, where even a vague rumor brings a special visit (together with their indoctrination program) the suits from their corporate union busting division. And they eavesdrop on phone and email conversations of their employees to pick out any such rumor. They've even used high tech bugs, and infiltrators to police their employees for any suggestion of concerted activity.

Or how about my nephew who worked as a chef for a major hotel chain; when a new corporate conglomerate bought out the chain, they issued an edict which they claimed was for """"the privacy of associates."""" Anyone employed at the hotel chain was no longer allowed to use the last name of any other employee, under any circumstances, except when required for official business. My nephew (who has never been a union activist) says it was an obvious new rule aimed at making it more difficult for employees to communicate with each other outside of their place of employment. He described it as pre-emptive union busting. Not in any sense a reaction to """"events such as picketing, card check, organizing, and strike actions..."""" 

In brief, this article used to be pretty well focused on the issue of union busting. But in some places it has been edited to create a false impression about the reality of union busting. I won't say the editors are biased, but the edits sure the heck are. Others may draw their own conclusions.   """,0.0

Yes, I understand that the technical proposal is to rename the article, but I also appreciate that names matter.  It's also worth noting that this is the longest rename discussion I've ever seen at WP.  Apparently, I'm not the only one who thinks the name of this article matters more than usual.  

I may be missing some very notable exceptions, as I have not been involved in the dispute until now, but I see no unbiased editors.  I see editors who either support the concept of men's rights or feminists.  That is to say, without belaboring the topic, I see two diametrically opposed ways of viewing the world.  One way says men of every society in every corner of the world developed abusive and patriarchal social structures that oppressed women.  The other way says that gender roles evolved by men and women working together in accordance with biological imperatives like survival.  That these gender roles limited, benefited and oppressed both sexes in different ways by forcing them to conform to the roles that society dictated.  Feminist patriarchy theory has a fundamental need to attach male malice in the way gender relations evolved and inculcate guilt in modern-day males for the supposed sins of their male predecessors.  Tangential rant aside, if we can appreciate that there are two opposing sides here we can achieve a much better and balanced article.  But, instead, what we have on one side are a bunch of feminist editors, armed with all the sources that 30 of feminist dominated academia can churn out disingenuously feigning to be unbiased, disinterested editors who are merely trying to apply WP policy to produce the best article possible.  On the other side, we have the men's rights activists.  """"Men's Rights"""" are, essentially, what men's rights activists say they are.  If the article, """"men's rights,"""" doesn't have at least 50% of its content from sources that point to """"men rights activists"""" (a term that I see used pretty pejoratively on the """"Men's Rights"""" talk page) then the article is hopelessly biased.  All feminist sources regarding men's rights are, essentially, sources that respond to the arguments and/or actions of men's rights activists (male or female.)  To base more than 50% of the article on the feminist response to the article's topic is a poor way to write an article.  Such an article can easily occur here if we try to stick to the best WP:RS without including both sides (because we have failed to acknowledge that there are, in fact, two sides here,) as we will end up with an article that amounts to """"Men's Rights according to Feminists.""""  The reason for which being that the men's rights activist source may be from some small publisher or self-published but the women's studies text will be published from Oxford Press.  """,0.0

The fact that the building was once a prison is in fact less relevant as it betrays the idea of what the encyclopedia is all about. Currently, the focus should remain on its current use.

 sockpuppets on Physician

Thank you for reverting these edits.

I don' know why, but this article attracts lots of anonymous editors who like to delete without any explanation. I have asked a sysop (User:Shii) to semiprotect the article  he did this a month ago.

About 15 kilobytes (3/7 of the then total), including 2 large subsections, kept on being deleted by an apparent User:Nq0x77. One of the subsections (Other designations) has been in the article largely unchanged for well over a year; the wording here was earlier the subject of much discussion & editing because it concerned potentially controversial matters, but this was apparently resolved. When I tried Nq0x77's page to ask why, there was'nt one! No explanation of why the deletions are wise is shown on the Talk page. I've restored the article to the version left by User:Cubs197 earlier today, and you restored a further revert. The article has (or had)reached B class status, and is rated as top-importance, so I suggest major edits may merit at least some discussion, and I couldn't do this because User:Nq0x77 doesn't seem to be available.

 User:Shii wrote to me: just blocked the sockpuppet instead.  (tock) , and I have just replied: Thank you very much but, sadly, I think the same person is at it again, this time using a new and different sockpuppet (User: Pednursing ?), who has just made the same ~15kb deletion. Would semi-protect status stop this, or at least make it harder for him/her/it?

Well, you almost have it right, but not quite. Its like going over a hill.  To quote Chaiken, """"It was as if the moonship were coasting up a hill, one that became less and less steep as it went along.  About two days from now, on the afternoon of December 23, Apollo 8 would reach the gentle crest of that hill, the place where the earth's gravitational influence gave way to the moon's.  From then on it would begin falling toward its destination."""" (Chaiken, p. 95)  All bodies in space have a gravitational field, even an astronaut on an EVA has a gravitational field around them.  In this case, the moon's gravitational influence becomes stronger, and the earth's disappears, even though the moon orbits the earth, it's the moon's gravity that is having an effect on the spacecraft when it reaches a certain point in space.  Therefore, it is correct to say that Apollo 8 was the first manned mission to leave the earth's influence. """,0.0

This is Qatarihistorian
First of all, user Mttll was conducting vandalism on a hidden agenda. He didn't like the fact the Sultanate of Rum is identified as a Persianate state, even though sources clearly indicated the Persianate nature/identity of the state due to two factors: 1) that the state was based on a Persianate court culture. 2) that the state's official language was Persian. 

Nevertheless, user Mttll decided to move the term """"Persianate"""" to the section of arts and architecture, in order to disguise historical facts. When I prompted him of this, he tried to FURTHER disguise his actions by renaming the arts and architecture section to > culture, but that still was invalid.

The irony is, even though he wanted to discuss this issue with me on the article's talk page, he didn't want to compromise, therefore he said something along the lines of """"I don't care what you think"""" and went ahead with his pathetic actions of distorting facts. 

I even showed in my edits that I had no problem with him wanting to call the Sultanate of Rum a """"Turkish"""" state, so long as he provided references for it. By the way, LONELYPLANET travel guides are not reliable references, I hope you people realize that.

Therefore in my recent edits, I wrote the Sultanate of Rum was a Persianate AND Seljuk Turkish state. It can be both at the time. They don't conflict each other by any means. Now the problem with user Mttll is his clear nationalistic agenda in the article, whereby he tries to promote only the Turkish aspect of the state while negating the sources to suggest the Persianate aspect.

In his user talk page, he is blatantly lying to the admin by telling him that I reached agreements with him. I certainly did not. And for the sake of wikipedia's reliability, I will ensure the information regarding Sultanate of Rum being a Persianate state will be restored because nothing warranted its move in that article, unless a hidden nationalistic agenda was intended.

"The sentence that both of you want added is completely irrelevant to what anarchocapitalism is, and is dealt with in the body of the text. I'll give you an example via wikiprecedent: christianity. The lede does say that protestantism came from catholicism, just as the lede for anarchocapitalism says that it is an individualist anarchism form (parent). But the lede of christianity does not say (though it could with references) that the catholics did not consider protestants to be christian (and vice-versa). And given that historically western christianity was catholic only for a thousand years, we see the argument from antiquity attempt clearly fail.

As to what you misunderstand, Binksternet, it is due weight. I'll give another wikiprecedent: evolution. There is neither mention of creationism nor ID in the lede for evolution. At all. Period. But it is clearly significant enough to have been brought up in court in the US many times regarding the teaching of it and of ID. One would think, then, that it would get mentioned. But no, it's not. Why? Because it's irrelevant to what evolution is. Similarly, that some people view anarchocapitalism as not part of anarchism is irrelevant to the lede as well. -",0.0

""" For example, a prior discussion: The whole story of Frank Dux and the Kumite is a fraud. There is no such thing as the """"Kumite"""" tournament.

Does anyone honestly believe that such a world class underground full contact tournament could have gone on, and there would remain no evidence of it beside Dux's testimony? Anyone who could produce evidence of such a thing would have a million dollar story, but no one has. Wouldn't someone eventually come forward, or one or two fighters maybe speak out against it? What about the families of the fighters? Wouldn't they notice that their loved ones come home with broken bones and missing teeth? Dux himself claims that there were fatalities. In that case wouldn't the families of the dead fighters investigate what happened? Dux further claims that there were spectators gambling in the event (as in the movie), then how could they keep the silence of the spectators for all these years? To this day there remains no video, or pictures or anything to substantiate Dux's claims.

Dux further claims that he holds the record for the fastest """"kick with a knockout"""" at 72 mph. This makes no sense whatsoever. Is there a cop with a radar gun next to ring, measuring the speed of every strike? A 72 mph kick seems impossible, as swords don't even swing that fast. Someone wouldn't just """"jump into"""" such an event either, but they would have training partners, and a record of their fighting career. They would have won tournaments, and fought in other full-contact venues (like ones that actually exist), yet their is no footage or evidence of Dux's participation in such events. He is a martial artist, but nothing like he claims.

The only thing that's been knocked out here is Dux's credibility. Soldier of Fortune magazine exposed his lies about his military career. Using the Freedom of information act they showed that the actual years of his service in the military don't match up with his claims. He could have never served in Vietnam, and was never a special op like he claims. They exposed a picture of him in the military as a hoax, by showing that the ribbons and medals on his uniform are inconsistent with his branch of service. His own response to this is that the uniform was a costume that he was wearing on the way to a halloween party. You gotta be kidding me. Dux sued them for libel and lost.

He also sued Jean Claude Van Damme, saying that he (Dux) had come up with the story for the movie """"The Quest"""", and that Van Damme had made a contract with him for royalties that were never paid. Dux failed to produce any evidence of such a contract, and claimed that the missing evidence was destroyed in an earthquake. Van Damme's lawyer ripped Dux's credibility to shreds, showing that Dux's apartment was not damaged like he said it was, and produced a cast of witnesses to support that Dux is a story teller and pathological liar.

In his book, Dux goes on to make other astounding claims about being a real life James Bond character working for the CIA during the 80's, and many more fantastic tales. The publisher (Harper Collins) pulled the book, and not due to poor sales either. Maybe because they realized they had been duped by this guy, just like the producers of the movie Bloodsport. Just goes to show how little credibility Hollywood has, even when they make the claim that something is based on a true story. 71.233.140.67 (talk) 

    * First, let me say I agree with you. I want to make that clear, because you're not going to like the answer I have to give you. Read WP:TRUTH and one of the first things you will see is: """"Truth is not the criteria for inclusion of any idea or statement in a Wikipedia article, even if it is on a scientific topic. The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth—that is, whether readers are able to check that material added to Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source, not whether we think it is true."""" I don't like that. You probably won't either, but that is the state of affairs. Those excellent questions you asked? Those are considered original research WP:OR. If someone else asks them in a reliable source, then we can add that to this article. But until they do, we can't. Although we can all edit here, we don't own Wikipedia. So when Dux disagrees with something and decides to sue, he doesn't come after Niteshift36 (although he might try), he comes after Wikipedia. The standard for biographies of living people WP:BLP is even higher than for articles about the deceased or other topics. I can't, for example say that Mr. John Doe is a lying a-hole on Wikipedia if he is still alive. I can't even say it on a talk page or my own user page. But if a writer in Time magazine does an interview where his former boss calls Doe a lying a-hole, we can possibly include that. There are a lot of people who have asked the questions you did. I",0.0

 Autograph Pages. 

I saw your message on ANNAfoxlover's talk page. Tell me, what do you think should be done with all the autograph books? I'm probably sounding zealous, but I would like to see them deleted. They don't seem to be of any use to Wikipedia. Sure, my own subpages don't help Wikipedia much, but at least they are of some use. Autograph books sound like the sort of thing you have to sign when going into a fancy restaurant to show that you ate there (not a brilliant analogy, but it's reasonable).  

I shouldn't comment since I just launched an alternative site for autograph books but the reason I did that was because I strongly suspect these will be deleted from Wikipedia - but not by me. .

 Taking this to your own talk page as you don't seem quite as keen on listening to what I've got to say over on my page as you are hellbent on defiling everyone's edits for your enjoyment 

Alright, I've just had it up to here with you and your blasphemous claims of everyone's edits being """"unreferenced crap"""" because you're the only one who can't remain content of having others contribute to the site. I can put up with your labels of every edit you find disastisfactory to your bigoted tastes as """"vandalism,"""" but going through everyone's freaking contributions list to make it some White Man's Burden to undo every small trimmings of blatantly incorrect or dingy information is just pushing the line, so I suggest you don't break the 3-edit rule yourself if you're so pompously insisting the rules and law enforcements here are on your side.

Let's see back where this started in the Freeza section, for example. Like I said on my edits page, I haven't familiarized myself with making those neat little references at the bottom to add to my edits, so in straight, bold text as clear as day, I posted the chapter number where the psychic ability itself was displayed, and could well post an image to back up my claims, while each and every one of the rest of the information I posted was seen throughout his extended fight sequences with Goku and co., you can bet your money on it; it's not Berserk or Blade of the Immortal we're talking about here, but plain-out, simple everyday Dragonball, which everyone (save you) would be fully capable of seeing. 

Then, the Vegeta article? Please, Vegeta himself professed about the 17 million zenos required to initiate his Ozaru transformation which can only be produced by a full moon or his power ball that mixes with the planet's oxygen to create a replacement, which both he and Gohan used to transform, and after his tail was sliced off by Yajirobe, he fled to the Freeza Planet and stated that his tail would grow back after he came out of the healing tank with the tail stump in plain view. None of this is uncited information by any means, and you're well striking a chord with everyone's anger by hellbenting on removing all that on the crappy pretense that because you can't deal with someone else making contributions, you're right in labeling them """"unreferenced crap"""" or """"vandal"""" and digging through everyone's records like a 40-year old wanker to annul every effort.

And again, the Piccolo article? I simply added that Nail was the one he first fused with to gain his """"massive increase"""" and that he was the one who kicked Freeza away to help buy time for Goku's Genki Dama to charge, and I myself removed some so-called """"crap"""" information like """"Piccolo's bukujutsu being a different technique"""" when the Japanese manga simply states that his technique is a superior kind. What little others there were (my contributions, I mean) are simple, medial additions like """"scientist Gero"""" added to the unclear information that simply said """"Red Ribbon"""" at first, when it was just the one guy and nobody else that was working for vengeance. 

And finally, I've been on this site since back in 2005 or 6 or so since I was 14 and fully know my rules and qualifications, and haven't been blocked once, so I'd suggest that you take it to my profile if you've got such a beef with my edits that you need to act like a petulant, 4-year old child who wants his toy back destroying everyone's contributions on your whim when you yourself are no authority.

 One Buzzfeed article has suggested that this accolade has since been surpassed by Desperate Housewives. However, this claim has not appeared in any other mainstream publication and it has not been discussed by cast or crew of either series. While several of the main cast members of Desperate Housewives are female, two male actors, James Denton and Ricardo Antonio Chavira, have appeared in every episode of the series. In the title credits, the mixed-gender cast is credited together; in the first season, the series is billed as 'Starring Terri Hatcher', [et al], Steven Culp, Ricardo Antonio Chavira, [...] and James Denton'. By contrast, only female cast members, Holly Marie Combs and Alyssa Milano, have appeared in every episode of Charmed and have been credited as main cast members in every series. The introductory credits bill the series as 'Starring Shannen Doherty, Holly Marie Combs, and Alyssa Milano' (for seasons 1-3) or as 'Starring Alyssa Milano, Rose McGowan, and Holly Marie Combs as """"Piper""""' (seasons 4-8), followed by supporting and guest actors. While several published monographs, including the Handbook to Life in America by Rodney P. Carlisle (Rutgers University) and the Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World, have analysed Charmed as 'the longest-running show in history featuring female leads', no reference to this accolade in relation to Desperate Housewives has ever appeared in print. Aaron Spelling, Brad Kern, and the cast members, Milano, McGowan, and Combs, have all publicly recognized and discussed the accolade.

 James Burke (science historian) 

Hi. The problem at James Burke (science historian), is that the link you've added leads to White, which is about the colour white, not about the ethnicity.  If you had linked to white people, that would make more sense. Always remember to check your work ;) 

However, the """"ethnicity"""" field in the infobox seems quite bizarre to me. As you said about """"caucasian"""", it's an """"outdated racial categorisation"""", and I havne't seen it used before in other articles. I'm going to remove it entirely from that article, until I get some feedback from the folks who know about these things at Template_talk:Infobox_Person#Ethnicity.

Change of title
The peer review assessment mentioned that the article is clearly not about a legend, but about a personage, Red Horn, who is the protagonist of various stories (legends, myths, etc.). The object is not just to give an account of legends, but to describe the state of knowledge on this deity. The Winnebago describe him as a man, but in a very broad sense, like the Norse mann, which denotes not only mortal humans, but members of various divine races. Given that English is a little more restrictive in this way, I don't advise """"man"""" in the parenthetical part of the title. """"Deity"""" is probably safe enough when broadly construed. He is at least a supernatural being. He is not found in Algonquian sources, nor in Caddoan. One can adduce by argument other cognates all of which are from Siouan tribes. It is probably safe, therefore, to describe him as a """"Siouan diety"""". This is based on what we know, archaeological speculations aside.""",0.0

 notability and sourcing 
Dear 74

thank you for your answer. I really appreciate the way you propose to communicate as it gives more comfort for both of us and builds dialog and consensus.

Thank you for your suggestions on how to improve this article. I agree with them but I think I should first follow Fiddle Faddle's suggestion """"that the first task is to show and prove notability though""""

I fully understand and agree with wikipedia rules - thanks to which the quality of articles is high and I want to follow that. This is why I prepared (it took a lot of my time - believe me) a detailed info proving notability and the fact that I mostly use secondary sources (It's available here  Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/SORCER). Unfortunately, till now from those who have doubts on notability and sources - there was no single comment showing directly what in their opinion is not enough within presented proves.

So as I appreciate our way of communication I would like to ask you for your opinion about the proves of notability and sourcing which I have provided here: Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/SORCER. I encourage you to read all of it but if you would like to focus on proves only - they are listed with following dates/signatures:

Additionally in Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/SORCER you can find opinions of 2 members who are specializing in computing:

"I'm glad the question has been settle as it has. I think the article is better, but still needs work on the history (I will try to do that). Although it is not important now, you can also see that these beers are not related here: 
http://www.brauer-bund.de/bierfans/sorten/inhalt.htm That page does list related styles, but clearly Dortmunder and Märzen are not. This page, by the way, is from the Association of German Brewers.

I would like to end on two points: 1. the fact that Mr. Daniels is not aware that these two beers are not related is evidence that he violates WP:RS. I should also point out that this is not an obscure topic, but something anyone who knows about German beer would know. 2. On a personal level, I regret to tell you that I was very insulted by your idea that an American home brewer knows more about my culture than I do. An apology would be appreciated.",0.0

Actually, Alberuni, I was cynically reffering to the rude way you use the word """"Zionist"""" in reference to certain users and/or edits. It would be no different than if I accused every edit by users with Pro-Palestinian views as """"Jihadist POV hacks"""" (or similar wording, you get the idea). It is the manner you conduct yourself, not your POV, that has caused many to dislike you. A little bit of courteousy goes a long way. 20:05, 21 Oct 2004 (UTC)

"Another amazing and neutral wikipedia article *cough* *cough*...(yes it is an irony) ==

Another Zodiac article full of Npov issues and even misinterprations of the sources.Why...? 
Well because some people add to much negative traits or some others add way to much positive traits. There are even people that when they give a source they totally misinterpretate that source for their own personal agenta (i do not believe in coincidences in this site) 

Taurus is not a perfect zodiac. IT HAS GOOD BUT ALSO BAD QUALITIES just like every zodiac.
Some people must get that into their arrogant heads and stay neutral when they contribute or some reports to the Administrator will start happening around here for Non-neutral point of view activity. I am not a professional astrologer but i have enough astrological knowledge and i understand when someone is being neutral and contributes 100% exactly from what a source says...and who is not doing that.

 Choosing an easement curve 

I'd like to be clear about:
(a) which curves are actually used in practice ...
(b) in the various railways administrations; not just North American but also others, e.g. Australian, European, Indian etc.  (This would help with NPOV.)

My main concern is with (a).  Although the article mostly discusses Euler spirals, it seems to give the impression that's the only curve used, under varying names.  However, consider this quotation (from the AREMA reference in the article):
There are several different types of mathematical spirals available for use, including the clothoid, the cubic parabola and the lemniscate.  Of more common use on railways are the Searles, the Talbot and the AREMA 10-Chord spirals, which are empirical approximations of true spirals.
This reference is, of course, discussing common use on American railways; but even in this limited context, it appears there are at least three ideal mathematical spiral forms involved: """"the clothoid, the cubic parabola and the lemniscate"""", along with various practical approximations to them.

The article would ideally give the history of the use and adaptation of these various spiral forms.  Doing so would provide a solid illustration of how technological innovation was both necessitated and encouraged by the Age of Rail - a valuable insight into the social impact of rail.

I'm guessing that the AREMA reference probably continues on from the quote above to give some further detail about those approximations, their inventors and their history; but it may not.  In any case, can anybody provide suitable references to help flesh out this story?

 World View Tag

As such the world view of this article is correct since the article itself correctly describes the history on the world view.  Because the Internet was created in the USA and with funds from the NSF does not mean it is not correctly showing the world view.

 Shrug. You can say that for any kingdom. The Germanic concept of a """"kingdom"""" is not a geographic area, it is a political area, defined by folks, not acres.  The area (often a Latin term) will always be an informal shorthand for a collection of dominions of barons owing allegiance to a king. """"East Franks"""" are a folk, """"Germany"""" is an area. """"Lombards"""" are a folk. """"Italy"""" is an area, etc. The """"Kingdom of Germany"""" refers to the collection of barons in the area that once constituted the lands of the East Franks and their subject tribes (Swabians, Bavarians, Saxons, Thuringians, etc.), which by the 10th-11th C. is now settled down into large duchies (the royal duchy of Franconia, plus Swabia, Bavaria, Saxony, etc.).  This specific collection of barons acclaim their king, who is crowned in Aachen (usually) by the Archbishop of Mainz (almost always).  This is the """"King of Germany"""", and the area these barons cover we can call the """"Kingdom of Germany"""".  There really is no term more convenient to call him or it.    """,0.0

Quote; """"I understand that many Irish don't like the term British Isles.""""'. Not totally true, the term is rarely used in Ireland, most Irish people don't care what people in Britain want to call the group, and would consider the term outdated in a modern forward democratic world, and thus avoid its usage. The term is occasionally used throughout the world, its usage is the exception, rather than the rule. I think the problem with the term is that it started out in life as a political term, of Great Britain claiming ownership of all the islands in the group, and to many people that original meaning still stands.

Ernie: Well, I'm not surprised at all.  Of course I'll support the templates. They provide a super purpose in linking films.  To be honmest, that's one of the reasons I started editing Argentine films.  I saw the cohesiveness of the section.  The template is very important.

The problem is ego and the """"psychology"""" of some wikipedians.  Some may feel they should have control in the section they work in.  People begin to take """"quasi"""" proprietary thoughts about not only their area of expertise on wiki, but in the edits they make in that area.

In a de facto way you take care of the Cinema of Argentina.  There are others who may take the same approach to other areas of the cinema world but place ego very much into it (I've never found you that way).  They subconsciously took it as an affront that you did not talk to them first.   That's why I'm hesitant to take on other areas in the world of cinema, there are so many footprints and egos to deal with.

I agree with Hoverfish completely as to the approach you take vis a-vis the arguments you make in this matter.  I also state that I'm in """"touch with your emotions.""""

I'm glad to be working on the cinema of Argentina and have a very understanding majordomo such as yourself.  You always see the bigger picture and have been of tremendous help.

 The article is incomplete 

Well written and interesting. Good.

I think the article would benefit from identifying the former bands of the members. What I find frustrating is that the article seems to assume knowledge of UK indie music. Why is it a supergroup? Who is Damon Albarn? Paul Simonon? Tony Allen? Simon Tong? I knew Damon, but I had to click 3 more links to find out the others. As an international wiki, anyone outside the UK will have no idea who these people are. The article should explain to anyone assuming no prior knowledge. Mention and link to the Clash, the Verve, Blur etc as well. 

After all, this is meant to be an encyclopaedia. It's not an article in NME, and space isn't an issue. Identifying the history of the members and explaining why it was considered a """"supergroup"""" is surely relevant to the article.

On another note - I only noticed who produced the album was here when I returned to it and looked at the top right side panel. I was expecting to find this at the bottom under the list of personnel. On my first visit I had to click other links to be certain that Danger Mouse had done it.

Hope that didn't sound too much of a complaint.

"""few more issues that need to be addressed.  Perhaps interested editors could post new issues or try to fix them. Here is an initial list, put together in a peer review by Dana Boomer:

Here are some concerns that I found in the article on a quick run-through:
 resolved Please make sure that the discussion regarding naming is completed and the decision is finalized with consensus one way or the other before you nominate for GA status.
 There are two citation banners in the article, both for lack of inline citations, and both were placed there several months ago.
 resolved There are several sections in the article (Working, utility and assistance dogs, Show and sport (competition) dogs, Dangerous substances) that are composed almost completely of lists.  MOS discourages lists in articles, so these should be turned into prose as much as possible.
 There are a lot of short sections in the article.  For as many of these as possible, please either expand them or combine them with other sections.
 resolved There shouldn't be external links in the body of the article as there are at the end of the Ancestry and history of domestication section.  Instead, these should be turned into references, moved to the external links section, or removed altogether.
 The article needs quite a bit more referencing.  For example, in the Ancestry and history of domestication section, six out of seven paragraphs are completely unreferenced.
 Make sure that all of your web references have publishers and last access dates.  Also, please make sure that you are actually using the publisher, and not the work.  For example, with current ref #41 (The Case for Tail Docking), the publisher should be Council of Docked Breeds, not cdb.org.  
 resolved References that are in English do not need to be marked as such.  References that are in any language other than English do need to be marked.
 resolved Current ref #70 (Wolf at my door) deadlinks.
 resolved The Australian National Kennel Club external link deadlinks
I didn't go through the article line by line, so there are probably things that I missed.  The above are just fairly big issues that jumped out at me on a quick look through the article.  Also, I was recently involved in bringing Horse (another article about an animal with significant human interaction) to GA status...you may want to take a look there to pick up some ideas about layout, referencing, style, etc.  Drop me a note on my talk page if you have any questions, and good luck on your quest for GA.     —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  """,0.0

After Arkansas Preservation redesigned their web site a few weeks ago, there are a number of issues with the NRHP part of the site.  I have found at least two instances of listings that are missing from search results, and numerous PDFs of listings are also missing.  If you find what seem to be missing entries, you can try to find them the NRIS mirror run by Elkman, which has all listings up to about April 2010 (i.e. it has no listings or delistings after then).  If they show up in Elkman but not on the Arkansas Preservation site, contact them (info@arkansaspreservation.com), they're pretty good about responding.  On the old web site, I would report errors or omissions that would be fixed within a business day.  Sometimes the omission from their site is caused by an imminent delisting.  For bridges, you can also see if Bridgehunter has images or other information (like better lat/lon, which these two listings need).

In this case, listings for """"Cove Creek Bridge"""" and """"Cove Creek Tributary Bridge"""" both show up in Elkman (Tributary=95000644, Creek=95000645), and are given separate resource identifiers (in the """"Other Names"""" field in Elkman: Tributary=LO0051, Creek=LO0050).

There is another source for Tavernor on his derivation of """"plus or minus"""" 
and why he chose """"Smoot's Ear"""" for his title:
http://tech.mit.edu/V127/N43/smoot.html
This is an account by Marie Y. Thibault of Tavernor's speech at MIT 
about his book, with Smoot in attendance.

Both his Preface and his speech have similar structures concerning 
Smoot's Ear and """"plus or minus"""".
Both appear to be explanations of his choice of title.
Both open with """"+ 1 ear"""".
It's presented by Tavernor as the historical basis, i.e., the 
historical measurement as shown by the 1987 plaque, and the 
decades of paint on the bridge.
Both derive """"plus or minus"""" from """"+ 1 ear"""".
Neither states that the historical measurement was """"plus or minus"""". 
Thibault gives a direct quote from Tavernor 'The significance of
Smoot’s Ear is that is stands for an approximation, a “plus or
minus”'.
""""Smoot's Ear"""" is a component of the historical measurement,
""""+ 1 ear"""".
""""stands for"""" is clearly not an historical recounting,
but a reference to Tavernor's interpretation.
He's distinguishing the earlier """"Ear"""" from his contribution,
""""plus or minus"""".

If """"plus or minus"""" were already part of the historical record, it
wouldn't be necessary or desirable to begin with """"+ 1 ear"""".

""""Plus or minus"""" was not part of the historical record, it was
introduced (for purposes of this discussion) by Tavernor as
his interpretation, not part of the historical record.   
Tavernor's account in the Thibault article is clearer on some of 
these points than the Preface, but both seem to achieve the same 
basic end, explaining how the """"ear"""" in """"+ 1 ear"""" from the
measurement on the bridge leads to the ideas in the book, beginning
with """"plus or minus"""", i.e., uncertainty.

Tavernor isn't trying to say that his treatment was on the bridge,
nor measured on the bridge,
quite the contrary, that he took this human measurement, with a
component obviously intended to provoke, inter alia, the notion
of uncertainty, and related it to the whole history of
measurement and made a book of it.

It doesn't matter how many times Tavernor says
the bridge measures 364.4 Smoots plus/minus an Ear.
He could say it 300 times.
He might even say the length of the bridge is 360
Smoots plus or minus an ear.
That has its own truth.
These are only a couple of simple derivative forms 
out of a host of possible derivative forms.
From what are they derived?
Tavernor tells us.
He begins his Preface and book and speech on this subject with
the historical measurement, 364.4 smoots + 1 ear.

Tavernor's first reference citation within his book, for the 
Preface, which certainly seems to be the one he considers most
important, is to what he calls a corroborating interview 
http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5043041
That's the one I quoted earlier 
[ 2005-12-07 ]
""""Now how long is the Harvard Bridge if it's measured in smoots?""""
Mr. SMOOT [himself]: 
""""Three hundred and sixty-four point four, plus one ear.""""
It'd be pretty incongruous to argue that he found """"plus or minus""""
there.
Also, he repeatedly cites WP, which at the time, didn't have
""""plus or minus"""".
Contrary to my initial thoughts when his Preface was being
put forward to re-write history, that he was 
not well situated to know about this, he does make it clear 
that he carefully checked into the bridge.
He is a distinguished scholar and an architect who
happens to be in a Dept. of Sociology, who wrote a book that 
seems to be a good read.

Tavernor's Preface was cited on the 
morning of New Year's Day, 2008, as support for the edit of 
Smoot to add ±, but the Preface actually refutes the 
edit by its reference to + 1 ear.
± didn't arise on the bridge; it showed up in Tavernor's
Preface.
Tavernor quotes the 1987 plaque to that effect.

If no one can say what from Tavernor's Preface seems to a) conform 
to WP:NOR and b) support the current language of the 5 
articles, then, yes, this would be an excellent time to revert to 
something only a minor copy-edit different than the language which",0.0

Abrazo fraternal
Hi Rockero! I just wanted to give you a big brotherly hug. You made me proud by paticipating on the May 1 march, the Great American March.

Due to things off my hands, (appointments, car broken, my neighbor is not legal so she chose not to go because Arpaio allegedly threatened to arrest illegals, only small groups gathered here) and just plain bad luck I wasn;'t able to march but I protested too, wearing White that day and resisting my ever attacking urges to shop and shop, which are like the munchies to me. Today Im already looking forward to what Im gonna buy tonight..lol!!

Anyways, banderas arriba!! We gotta peacefully fight the racists, show them we are here to stay. Spain's and Chile's consulate urged their citizens to protest, and I saw Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, Chilean, Venezuelan and Salvadorean flags on the march when I looked at the news. Aquel vato from Walkout! said """"what a beautiful day to be a Chicano!"""" I kept thinking about those words on May 1, what a beautiful day to be Hispano. 

Im getting a book, Growing up Chicano...have you read it? How good is it? I want to get the entire Hispanic experience in me, not just the Puerto Rican-Caribbean Hispanic experience and to be honest if it was Growing up Bolivian or Spainard Id buy it too, but I cant wait til I read this book Growing up Chicano.

By the way, Feliz 5 de Mayo!

On second thought, Max, I just took a look at the history and saw that you posted not only the link that you say you're not defending, but also the link to the material from the white supremacist antisemite, William Pierce. There's no need to keep the link on the page while discussing its merits (although that link has no merits to discuss). Wikipedia's editors know how to look at edit histories. When a link is that egregious and beyond the pale, any responsible editor will remove it until it's existence can be justified. Also, I didn't """"remove an external link """"without cause."""" I explained my cause, both here and in the edit summary. That cause was not a """"claim that it's offensive in some way,"""" but a clear, obvious violation of WP:EL and WP:RS with regard to fringe websites.

However, I've just taken a look at your edit history, and can honestly say that, outside of your edits to this article, I can't see any evidence of an antisemitic agenda on your part, so I'm going to continue to WP:AGF. However, it will be to your advantage to recognize that editors who are accustomed to working on Judaism-related articles have long experience with users who """"just innocently raise the question"""" of whether there might be racist material in the Talmud, or whether there just might be a Jewish conspiracy for world domination, or whether we've fairly portrayed the views of folks who think that The Protocols of the Elders of Zion is a genuine document, and shouldn't we leave the material up while we discuss it? The answer to that question is no, and if my assumption of good faith is justified, you'll have no trouble seeing why.

Again, Max, follow those links and you'll see why neither you, nor I, nor any responsible editor would want them to stay on this article or any other that we had a hand in. I'm honestly not trying to start a feud or a flame war or anything else, and I do wish you the best experience possible on Wikipedia.  """,0.0

"So what it seems you are mentioning here is that the only American film from an American famous short story, that is required reading in most high schools, with famous American actors, that can be identified on numerous internet sources, is not notable? Two famous studios have released it at this point as well. 

Wikipedia Guidelines: The common theme in the notability guidelines is that there must be verifiable, objective evidence that the subject has received significant attention from independent sources to support a claim of notability. The absence of citations in an article (as distinct from the non-existence of sources) does not indicate that the subject is not notable.

Wikipedia Guideliens: No subject is automatically or inherently notable merely because it exists: The evidence must show the topic has gained significant independent coverage or recognition, and that this was not a mere short-term interest, nor a result of promotional activity or indiscriminate publicity, nor is the topic unsuitable for any other reason. Sources of evidence include recognized peer reviewed publications, credible and authoritative books, reputable media sources, and other reliable sources generally.

The Harbrace Guide to Writing books (both of them, published and distributed to colleges throughout the U.S. referencing the film) falls under credible and authoritative books.

Since I am a long-term donor of Wikipedia, it seems that this is a direct violation of what Wikipedia professes their site is. 'The Free Encyclopedia'. An Encyclopedia is a reference for documented, written sources. Together, all the sources add up to an article, which deems notability as referenced above.  I am not trying to be argumentative, but factual in what Wikipedia claims they are as a source, and what they have told me they are in terms of my donations as a supporter over the years. 

With the extra reference you have acknowledge above, the third reference of the Harbrace Guide to Writing (100,000 print copies) is yet another verifiable source. Again, this is not a confrontation. thank you.",0.0

wikipedia's censorship

I looked up Bash Back (The sodomite terrorist group that attacked the Church in Michigan) on wikipedia  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_Back) just to see what liberal bias they would have. Under the section """"Antifascist action at 2008 Milwaukee Pridefest"""" Wakopedia says """"In response, Bash Back! Milwaukee planned a confrontation of the hate group."""" the """"hate group they are talking about is the NAZIs but then if the NAZIs are a hate group then Bash back must also be a hate group so I edited it to say """"In response, The hate group Bash Back! Milwaukee planned a confrontation of the hate group.""""

Since they also didn't have any topic for the new terrorist attack on the church I added a few lines & was attacked by the Admins. So they added the following paragraph
2008 Disruption at Mt. Hope Church in Lansing, MI

Bash Back! members disrupted a Sunday sermon at Mt. Hope Church in Lansing, Michigan on November 9th, 2008. They dropped a banner in the church, threw thousands of fliers, made out in front of the congregation, yelled """"Jesus was a Homo"""", pulled the fire alarm and initiated pro-gay chants. Mt. Hope is an Assemblies of God church which holds and promotes """"ex-gay"""" events and preaches that homosexuality is a sin.

I edited the first line of the paragraph to read """"Christaphobic Bash Back! members disrupted.... & added the following footnote 

""""Christphobia (from Greek Christós: Messiah; phóbos: fear, phobia) is an irrational fear of, aversion to, or discrimination against Christianity.""""

I took the defanition word for wors from Wakopedia's definition for Homophobia & just changed the Homo/Christos & Homo/ Christian parts.

For this I received the following note from the admin

This is the last warning you will receive for your disruptive edits, such as those you made to Bash Back. If you vandalize Wikipedia again, you will be blocked from editing. Please maintain a neutral point of view. ukexpat (talk)

Although the (German) dukes of Prussia were obliged to render homage to the Polish monach for 150 years or so, this was a result of the defeat of the Teutonic Order and its aftermath, not a symptom of Königsberg's ethnicity, which remained German until 1945-46, when Königsberg as such ceased to exist.

"""==Passion Killing in Namibia==
Introduction

In the Cambridge Advance Learner’s Dictionary, passion is defined as a very powerful feeling, for example of sexual attraction, love, hate, anger or other emotions and killing is defined as the act of murder. In this context Passion Killing is combined.Passion Killing can be defined as the act of killing someone out of the feeling of extreme anger, love, hate or other emotions.

In the past passion killing in Namibia was very minimal but now the number has gone up and it has become a trend. Recently, a large number of continuous Passion killing cases have been reported. So far it is only men that have been reported to have murdered women, breakups and infidelities being 2 of the main reasons amongst many.In this article I’m going to contemplate and discuss the causes of this aggravated passion killing in our society, who is at fault and recommendations as to what can be done to stop this type of violence.

The causes
The question on everyone’s lips is, “why are men killing women?”

 Amongst many causes, the most popular causes of passion killing reported have usually followed from women who depend on men for financial support, for things such as accommodation, tuition fees in a case of a student, food, clothes and other essential basic needs and in this case, men tend to become possessive and feel they own the women and when women call it quits, the men usually feels betrayed and sour and end up killing the women.The Namibian, 2012Namibian

 Another major cause that leads to Passion killing in our society is infidelity from women. When a woman cheats and the men finds out, the feeling of betrayal usually overpowers the man and they end up killing.

 A possible cause could be the lack of self control and lack of respect towards women.Causes

Who is at fault?
As I have observed, both men and women are to be blamed in different cases.

Firstly, certain men are at fault are because they don’t seem to understand the real meaning of love. """"The country should cry out for help. True love is patient, love is kind - it does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. Love always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.. Bishop Kleopas Dumeni, 2012 

Even if love is not involved, as it is in some cases, one would often feel that their ego is bruised or that their money has gone down the drain because they felt they had invested in something that they can own as property.In other cases men tend to become desperate for love and affection and end up offering material things and money to women to get some sort of affection even though the women have not demanded for it, In the end they feel they own the women and when they cheat or end the relationship they result to killing. 

Women are at fault in cases such as when they do not work hard to be independent and they accept all this material things because they want a chance at a luxurious and easy life at little to no cost. But little do they know that they might up paying with their lives when they do not stick to the person who is supplying with them with this sort of life. 

Women or both men and women are also at fault because they enter or initiate relationships for the wrong reasons, be it for money or sex and soon and in the end the differences start to surface, then there are misunderstandings and pain to one or both parties. 
Either way there are many different cases regarding passion killing and in  different cases either sexes are at fault but this still does not justify passion killing.

Recommendations
Recommendations 
The solution to this problem is a hard one to solve because it would require some sort of reaching out to the people of this Nation. Knowing the diversity of people, it’s hard to figure out what would impact certain people.  Never –the –less, the nation cannot sit back and watch this type of evil carry on. Informante

First, stop deleting without cause. 

Johnuniq, my suggestion is to either provide a peer-reviewed journal article for the methods of falsifiability listed in the article or provide detail as to why they would be valid methods of falsifiability or deleted that portion of the article. 

24.27 - I was referencing """"4.) observations of organisms being created;"""" from above and am saying that anything that references the necessity of a deity is not allowed into science. Thus this cannot be a method of falsifiability.  We do not allow creationism into science, so why would we allow it as a method of falsifiability.  Thanks you for being open-minded enough to not just flame me.

HRAFN  the platypus is not a transitional species because it currently exists and little is known about the Australian fossil record. Do you have a peer-reviewed journal article backing your claim or are you also committing WP:SOAP WP:SYN??

Dave  I have never been called an original thinker as an insult before, so thanks. These, however, are not original thoughts

1. It is not original thought to check that a listed method of falsifiability falls under the definition of falsifiability. The definition of falsifiability is """"Falsifiability (or refutability) is the logical possibility that an assertion can be shown false by an observation or a physical experiment."""" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability.  A static fossil record is not an assertion that can be shown false by an observation or a physical experiment. The fact that the record is not static is a fact that tends to support evolution, but not a method for falsifiability.

2. It is not an original thought that the idea of a deity is not allowed into science. Why would """"observations of organisms being created"""" be listed as a method of falsifiability for a scientific theory when they require a deity?

3. The definition of falsifiability is """"Falsifiability (or refutability) is the logical possibility that an assertion can be shown false by an observation or a physical experiment."""" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability. If one of these """"true chimeras"""" were to be found, it could still be hypothesized that they were two individual species living in symbiosis and that they evolved into what you see.  Since an observation of this kind would not prove evolution false, it is not a method for falsifiability.

4. """"A mechanism that would prevent mutations from accumulating"""" is not a method of falsifiability because http://books.google.com/books?id=JjLWYKqehRsC&pg;=PA157&lpg;=%20PA157&dq;=Drosophila+Fruit+fly+mutations&source;=web&ots;=%20V5yPPBPE6h&sig;=fOkUS_qLsARelWNDqpe5uhq70mI&hl;=en shows that death is a mechanism to at least temporarily stop mutations from accumulating for an entire population, yet evolution has not been deemed false.  

Dave, you may be right. These may be original thoughts, but if they are, then the science backing evolution is in a pathetic state and founded by scientists not smart enough to look at the definition of falsifiability. Or more likely I cannot find peer-reviewed journal articles making my claim because there are no peer-reviewed journal articles stating that these or valid methods of falsifiability in the first place. Thus, either provide a peer-reviewed journal article for the methods of falsifiability listed in the article or provide detail as to why they would be valid methods of falsifiability or deleted that portion of the article.""",0.0

 Coming to an understanding 

I've done most of the lion's share of edits on this article, but I want to make it clear that my interest is in having a neutral article, and that I'm not trying to push the idea that the Seth Material is true or valid (that's a judgement that the article can't make).  For example, the first use of the word """"channeled"""" had quotes around it.  I was the one who put those quotes in, though someone else removed them.  I inserted the first instance of the word """"purportedly"""" (even though it is on the list of words to avoid) because I felt it was needed, and I have reinstated it when other editors removed it.  Someone named """"Itsmejudith"""" has just changed the word """"awareness"""" to """"the idea"""", and I support that change.  I'm mentioning these small things simply as examples to show people that the neutrality of the article is important to me.  And despite what you may have thought (speaking to Verbal now), when I substituted """"Jane Roberts, speaking as Seth, said"""" for """"the Seth personality said"""", I believed that I was making a change that was a leap forward in neutrality (since Roberts was the one who actually uttered the words).

Verbal, I would like to try to bury the hatchet and work together on this article.  Your interest in the article appears to me to be negative, but I am willing to consider the possibility that I am wrong and to see your point of view.  In order to work together, we'll have to discuss specifics of the article on this page.  We'll need to discuss individual passages as well as the broader issues of the article's size and the proportion of primary to secondary cites.  If we make a concerted effort to work together, I'm sure we can come to an understanding and improve the article.  Are you with me on this?  """,0.0

 Perhaps... 

Perhaps you didn't read the article, which did have cited evidence of IP users being effective members of the community, and evidence. So I shall quote a piece of it here:

""""A large portion of our good edits come from IP addresses; positive experiences with initial IP edits lead users to create accounts who otherwise would not do so; recent changes disabling IPs from creating new or editing semiprotected articles are sufficient. According to Jimbo Wales, """"what is commonly called 'anonymous' editing is not particularly anonymous ... and there are good reasons to want vandals on ip numbers instead of accounts."""" While about 97% of vandalism comes from anonymous users, about  or 82% of anonymous edits are intended to improve the encyclopedia. (Prohibiting IP edits would not eliminate 97% of all vandalism, because if they have to, those inclined to vandalism could easily take the 10 seconds to register.) The ability of anyone to edit articles without registering is a Foundation issue.""""

IP users are an important part of the community. Don't hate.

"Greetings 

Greetings,

I edited a page, and you changed it back.  My information came from a Ranking Member of American Jujitsu and a Ranking Member of Australia Martial Arts (Chris Parker).  It is confirmed information.  The individuals name Krista Jacobson used to be Chris Brooks.  None on my contacts who have contacts in Japan can find any of her Dojos in Japan.  

I understand you are well versed in the subject matter or Martial Arts, so am I. I am also well versed in History of Warrior Societies.  She is claiming things that do not link up with History.

Is there a better way that it should have been edited on my part?

Hi. It's from the same user who was changing the images before on similar articles. Not to mention that, both images are good resolutions, contrary to what the user says, which is why I don't see the need to change images, delete galleries and remove content. It's unnecessary.   
It is nevertheless a content dispute. Neither the repeated switching of images nor the edit summaries that you consider misleading amount to vandalism, per Wikipedia:Vandalism#Types of vandalism and Wikipedia:Vandalism#What is not vandalism.  Donald Albury 

It was vandalism, but not mine.  Your images have extremely bad lighting and are not encyclopedic quality in the least.  One of them replaced a photo of a street in the article for that street Brickell Avenue and doesn't even show the street.  THE ARTICLE IS ABOUT THE STREET.  Also, you're supposed to answer a talk on the same page (Yours') that it initiated on, not put the answer on the initiators page so there are 2 half conversations on two separate pages.  I suggest you read a bit more about Wikipedia rules and stop vandalizing articles with your crappy poor lighting amateur photography from car windows.  66.176.139.222  """,0.14285714285714285

You have evidence from ME!  I presented you with tone of evidence, but you reject it because it goes against your fictional ideas of what New England is or should be.

 Promotional writing and non-free content 

The tone of this article is not factual and neutral, but comes across as a promotional brochure aimed at people who belong to to Lee's particular denomination or doctrine of Christianity. Cases in point: """"Lee knows that Christians lives are to be holy and should be empowered by the Holy Spirit"""",  """"Rev. Dr. Lee movingly testified to messages"""", """"...the fiery and explosive work of the Holy Spirit..."""", """"Blind eyes were opened to see and ears that could not hear came to hear"""" - those are a very few examples of utterly inappropriate and unencyclopedic phrases that abound in this text.  Add to this the fact that this article seems to make the claim that Lee can actually perform miracles of healing, in direct contravention of Wikipedia policies.  In addition, criticism and counter arguments have been removed or whitewashed, sometimes to the point of saying the exact opposite of what the sources state.

The article needs a lot of work by people who are not affiliated with Lee's organisation. At the moment, there are many editors who work only on articles connected to Lee and his work, and it seems probable that there is a strong conflict of interest here.

Another important issue is to do with non-free content. Bits of the promotional blurbs of Lee's books, and text taken straight from press releases, have been pasted into the article. It's difficult to find all the individual instances, because they crop up everywhere, and that's a very big problem. '''' contributions talk """,0.0

I moved the 69-72 Markham and Dixie championships from the Central B/Mid-Ontario to the Metro League, where they played.

DIXIE BEEHIVES 

(1957 - 1986)

Perhaps the first team to operate in the OHA under the Dixie name was the Dixie Staffords of the pre-Metro Junior 'B' Grouping that operated during the 1949-50 season. In 1952, the East York Rockets of the Metro grouping moved to become the Dixie Rockets. A few years later, the team changed its name to the Dixie Beehives. The Metro Junior 'B' Hockey League was a strong league and the Beehives were the league's most stable team. In 1972, a new Tier II Junior 'A' Provincial League was formed and the Dixie Beehives were one of six Metro teams to move up to the new league. The Beehives played in the league until 1986 when they ceased operations. The league managed to last only one additional season.

PATEY, Larry
Hockey
Born: March 19, 1953
Toronto, Ontario
Lary Patey played most of his young career in Mississauga, first in the Port Credit Hockey Association and later with the Metro Junior B Dixie Beehives. It was with the Beehives in March of 1971 that Patey suffered a near fatal accident during the Metro Junior B final against the Markham Waxers that Dixie would eventually go on to win in five games.

Hammered into the boards by 6- foot-6 defenceman Bob Dailey, Patsey slumped to the ice. While trying to get up, Patsey's teammate Rick Cornacchia took on Dailey in a tussle and the ensuing melee, Patey was caught in the face by a skate blade. 

From that horrific evening, Patey went on to a long and successful 12-year National Hockey League career as a centreman. After leading the Western League in scoring while with Sault Lake City Golden Eagles where captured rookie of the year honors, Patey was soon called up to the now defunct California Golden Seals. Later, Patey was traded to the St. Louis Blues in 1975-76 for Wayne Merrick and he concluded his career with New York Rangers before having to retire because of lower back injury.

A workaholic on the ice throughout his career, Patey later applied the same hard work ethic in the world of real estate and earned President's Club Honors as one of the Gundaker Better Homes and Gardens in St. Louis after only being in the business for four years.

While Patey had his most productive season offensively for California in 1974- 75 when he scored 25 goals to go along with 20 assists, it was during his stay with the Blues that the seventh-round draft choice drew the most attention for his strong two-way play.

""""St. Louis didn't care how many goals I scored- they had Red Berenson, Derek Sanderson and Gary Unger up front to do that. They wanted me to play defensively and aggressively."""" Patey combined both skills to set a St. Louis club record for most shorthanded goals in a season and was always called on to line up against the Bryan Trottiers, Bobby Clarkes and Phil Espositos of the NHL.

""""I enjoyed doing it because there was less pressure in having to score goals and I took a lot of pride in my role.""""

Living the life as a shadow, Patey did manage to score 153 goals in his 12 year professional career before retiring after the 1984-85 season.

While the league's fans didn't always notice Patey, or the fine job he did in shutting down opponents, his peers throughout the league certainly did.""",0.0

Haven't you noticed how many regulars have simply stopped editing out of frustration? Haven't you noticed how pretty much every question is answered by the same person? Do you not realize how responsibile you are for having actively participated in the transformation of the Humanities RefDesk from once being a vibrant place where one could find a multifaceted, multidimensional answer written by a variety of differing editors, each with his own invaluable unique insights and perspectives, into the stale, single-faceted unidimensional, useless place it is now?

No. It's not worth it. It's futile. Worse actually. Perhaps I share in some of the blame myself. If it wasn't for my relentless protestations, perhaps the whole thing would have blown over, Clio would have gotten bored of the Humanities RefDesk, moved on, and it wouldn't be the cold, sterile place it is now.

Perhaps I lost perspective, and didn't realize the magnitude of the harm that my persistent challenges could potentially inflict on a very fragile and terribly imbalanced young mind.

Just please read the damn thing over, Rockpocket. Here it is:  . Those rants of hers are clearly not the product of a healthy mind. I recognize that now. I have to stop. What I'm doing is wrong. So to all who will inevitably read this, I say publicly to Clio:

You win. I lose. You're right. I'm wrong. You're smart and you were right all along, I'm an intellectually impoverished imbecile. Yes, as you say, I'm pathetic. I'm honestly, genuinely sorry for having caused you such grief. I don't belong editing here on Wikipedia as I can't even approach your level of intelligence. I wish you nothing but health and happiness. Be well.

 Removed content 

I removed the following content which seems to be not particularly well-sourced, and a bit off topic - seems more related to a public relations type page, but I can't find exactly where it'd fit best, if anywhere at all.

""""==Two-Way Communication in Public Relations==
Two-way communication can be contrasted with [[broadcasting]], a one-way form of communication.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Two-way communication uses communication to negotiate with the public, resolve conflict, and promote mutual understanding and respect between the organization and its public(s). 

There are different types of two-way communication in public relations; symmetric and asymmetric.

'''Two-way asymmetric'''
*Employs social science methods to develop more:'''Persuasive communication'''
*Generally focuses on achieving short-term attitude change;
*Incorporates lots of feedback from target audiences and publics;
*Is used by an organization primarily interested in having its publics come around to its way of thinking rather changing the organization, its policies, or its views.

'''Two-way symmetric public relations'''
*Relies on honest and open two-way communication and mutual give-and-take rather than one-way persuasion;
*Focuses on mutual respect and efforts to achieve mutual understanding;
*Emphasizes negotiation and a willingness to adapt and make compromises;
*Requires organizations engaging in public relations to be willing to make significant adjustments in how they operate in order to accommodate their publics;
*Seems to be used more by non-profit organizations, government agencies, and heavily regulated businesses such as public utilities than by competitive, profit-driven companies.Source: Managing Public Relations by James E. Grunig and Todd Hunt, 1984

 Holodomor origin and use 

Hi, I'm sorry I referred to the topic in question as a 'conspiracy theory' - I need to learn to censor myself better on Wikipedia. -) 

In any case, I can share my experience with the word growing up in the Soviet Union in the 1980-90s. I was aware of the term ('Golodomor' in Russian transliteration) as the """"the great famine of early 1930s throughout the Soviet Union, predominantly in the Ukraine, but also in Southern Russia, due to the policies of the collectivisation and de-kulakization."""" There was no connection or comparisons to Holocaust in my mind, in part because the term Holocaust was not in use in the general discourse. It was as if WWII happened but Holocaust did not. That was really weird. 

Now, the term Holocaust in Russian is much more common. However, the two words look differently in Russian - Gogolomor and Holokost; so that's why (with my background) is hard to see a connection, although I'm more aware now of how it became a political rather than just a historic term. 

Hope this clarifies my perspective. Again, sorry about the choice of language on the Holodomor Talk page.

Hindu nationalism has an already an article. I don't see the point of reiterating it here again.
The article was NOT created as an extension of Hindi-Muslim conflict. That part is already mentioned here: Islam_in_India#Hindu-Muslim_conflict. If you think that is what needs to be done, please move it to Hindu-Muslim_conflict.
Anti-Buddhist can be removed, specially since his son himself corrected the mistakes. But on the otherhand, anti-christian, muslim, sikhism, hindu - they are fought over petty local policies and given the color of religion by recalling ancient atrocities. It would be akin to Spanish acquisition causing anti-Spanish violence now.

While you and me know what 'Religious Violence in India' typically refers to, a year from now it will refer to what the article's name suggest, with a new batch of trolls and POV pushers revert warring every edit. The article was created to quench the India-bashing thirst. At least I fail to see any other reason for its existence, because otherwise we wouldn't be discussing what the article really refers to etc.
Also, don't forget then the anti-Hindu violence, specially in southern India and eastern India - places where Hindus are in minority. And don't forget that the riots are never one sided. Right now the article looks like a list of religious atrocities committed in India, which is a ridiculous topic, but I believe it can be turned into a comprehensible and well cited article.

It seems at the end of the day, I'm convinced that both you and Vintagekits are to blame for a series of Wikipedia-as-battleground incidents, and you do not. From where I sit however, when he went straight to his old battleground, you welcomed him back in kind - and the fact is on Wiki experienced users are expected to do better than that. Some sort of attempt at peacemaking is best, or some sort of dialogue or somesuch. When you ran straight to an admin and then AN/I to get the topicban reinstated, it showed me that you are not interested (probably because you believe it is impossible) in working together with Vintagekits - and possibly others who share his viewpoint. You see it as more Vintagekits' fault, but from my chair, you're both beyond the cutoff. Please remember, my job is to not create parity, equity, equality, or even justice, though I flatter myself and think I can produce it in my own life on occasion. No, I am an administrator not a philosopher-king, and at the end of the day Wikipedia needs no one, not you, Vintagekits, or I, more than it needs a productive working environment as a whole.

When I was involved with Vintagekits' topic ban, at the previous round with the Baronets and troubles bans, I can tell you that they worked to great effect, maintaining him in a topic of interest - despite his protestations of injustice. I hope you can find something you're interested in as well outside your original main content. Try stretching outwards a little - perhaps the history of the British Parliament as a whole, and our articles on parliamentary procedure need to be updated badly and are Americentric.

"""YOUR SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AND ADDICTION==

This is the most """"contructive"""" thing that can ever be contributed as it relates to you and your involvement here: Please stop and think about the depth of your sickness, sitting there, with your face glued to your computer screen, uncompensated day after day, week after week, for YEARS, tinkering with the biographies of people you don't even know, who actually are out living real lives while you are imprisoned by your addiction.  You have literally wasted years of your life with this lonely, self-destructive addiction and illness, which has been at the expense of living your own life.  The depth of your mental illness must make it difficult for you to see the extraordinary insanity of your actions and how your addiction has stripped you of the life that was given you.  

I know a few others have evaluated what you do here and laugh at you and your sickness.  It's something of an inside joke, and I guess few share it with you because they consider you hopeless.  That's not right either, and I'd ask them to please stop that and try to help you.  Don't laugh at this person behind their back and then just communicate with them on routine matters.  That lacks all caring for a person who has an obvious and very serious illness. Something is very wrong with him/her, and while it may not be for us to diagnose the exact problem, we should pause to help with advice.  Please share with him/her what we all know.  It's only humane to do so. 

I will do so now too:

Jerzy (or whatever your name isconsciously concealed, I'm sure, to keep your illness as private as possible), please consider some uncomfortable facts:  Years of your life have now been totally consumed and absolutely wasted by your deep, deep sickness and obvious addiction.  Please don't make excuses for yourself.  You cannot go on like this any longer.  You need to stop, and you need to stop today.  Reject this advice, and I worry that your sickness will probably only deepen and your addiction will waste whatever is left of your life.  Please stop.  It's over.  Enough.  Move on.  I do wish you the best and hope you will take this friendly advice seriously.  It will be the first and last time I share it, and I hope you know that I share it only with your best interests in mind.  It's sad what has happened to you, but I wish you good luck and hope this advice is helpful.  But please take itand do so today.  You cannot go on like this.

"Philatelic categorization 

Hello.  Can you please bear with me re the categories as I have a massive amount of data to input.  Unfortunately, I do not have very much time to spend on the project and all my data has to be reformatted to meet Wikipedia’s tagging standard.

I have amended the categories because they lacked structure and there is need for a systematic approach.  A friend, who is a postal expert but only an occasional computer user, told me he was going round in circles trying to tie up relevant articles.  I am an IT professional and even I struggled to make any sense of the category structure.  

There should be a single root category and in this case philately is the obvious choice since that is the umbrella term for the entire pursuit.  Philately itself is a hobby or pastime or subject or whatever so it is entirely reasonable that it should also be a sub-category of those wider categories.  I found that philately had such as postage stamps, postal markings and postal history as sub-categories but philately was also a sub-category of each of those, which is nonsense and does not help new users.  Equally, similar articles such as the postage stamps of a particular country were categorised across the board instead of being allocated to a single category within a hierarchical or relative structure which non-IT people like my friend can easily navigate.

After I made a few amendments to the philatelic/postal categories, I asked my friend to try again and he found what he was looking for immediately.  This is the benefit of a structured, systematic approach.

Whereas philately is the root, it splits into two main sub-categories.  One of these is philately ‘’per se’’ which could be defined as the study of the physical aspects of stamps (e.g., watermarks, types of paper, gums, etc.).  The other aspect is the actual issue of the stamps for postal purposes and this is all done at the behest of a postal authority (on the chicken before egg principle).  Anything to do with issuing stamps and organising collection, sorting and delivery of mail is done by a postal authority which is why we believe it must rank as a main sub-category along with “physical” philately.  The term “postal authority” is a catchall for any organisation that has issued stamps and processed mail: national government, army of occupation, foreign postal agency, etc.

Having said all that, I agree that it is a good idea to categorise types of stamp independently of a country’s issues and, on that basis, “postage stamps” should be a sub-category of “philately”.  There is a clear difference between the two disciplines.  I will endeavour to make use of that difference, especially as our inputs will fall into both of those categories.

As I say, please bear with us as we have a massive input to make and it will take some time to accomplish.",0.0

"I agree that a split should occur, but my understanding of the situation differs from Jeremy's in two respects: 1) A split down purely ethnic lines is not going to be helpful, particularly because there is no colonial Hawaiian ethnic cuisine; there are only non-Hawaiian ethnic cuisines that have been introduced in Hawaii, and these already have articles (ex. English cuisine, Cantonese cuisine, Vietnamese cuisine, etc.). I agree that there should be a separate article for the cuisine of ethnic Hawaiians, but the other article should not be about colonial Hawaiian cuisine; it should be called Cuisine of Hawaii and be about the cuisine of the island of Hawaii, documenting all the cuisines found there, including ethnic Hawaiian cuisine. It will not be a parent article for the ethnic Hawaiian cuisine article because that article will include the introduction of Hawaiian cuisine into other regions of the world. 2) The name of the article about the cuisine of ethnic Hawaiians should remain at Hawaiian cuisine, not be moved to Native Hawaiian cuisine.

Images
I am sorry you had all this trouble with images. In Wikipedia, m:Comyright paranoia is pervasive and some users enjoy harassing others about images since the pretense of doing so to protect the Foundation gives them a perception of impunity while in many cases it would take less than a minute to simply retag the image uploaded by an inexperienced uses with the tag. Anyway, I will watch your talk page and when I see you being warned about some image I will take a look to see whether it can be saved from deletion. But even if you are unsure about copyright, please always provide the image source. It will make preserving it a whole lot easier. Happy edits,

Regarding images
Hi Bogdan. Regarding this your talk message: you can use the image request templates for filing standard images requests that will be automatically put to the respective category. I'd even ask you to do so. I requested that category to be populated: we need thousands of images on UA-related pages, so potential photographers (mappers etc.) need a consistent to-do list. 

And talking about images: I think placing our national flag next to """"the page looks bad"""" text on your userpage was a bad idea. Cheers,

"Well I suggest you read that file again and turn your thinking cap on this time. I do not need a lecture about the 'meaning' of George Wrights actions from you. George Wright has destroyed the organization along with a couple of editors here, and others at Techinc Washing. I also think that your use of the term 'Technocracy fundamentalist movement' is ignorant and demeaning. I posit that you being a 'self styled expert' that bit off the whole thing, and has instantly digested it is a little comical. You are dead wrong in your appraisal. If anything those people are the ones that are more in the genre you are suggesting. Building church`s in a Technate ? Special Interest groups in a Technate. Kolzene wrote and edited much of the Q&A;, and according to wiki that is self generated original conclusion stuff then that is a form of 'advertising' and blog 'driving' to original conclusions. To say what they are doing is a movement is sad. There are two people their that self publish stuff, and have sucked in the unwary who do not stay long. 
Further more you imply that movement has made 'progress' over time and become more interesting and more representative of the current status of things. That is not true. Technocracy was thought out originally to a purpose by a handful of brilliant scientists. Your implication of fundamentalism is just plain 'stupid'. You say that you have not read the book for a while ?
Well I suggest you read the last two chapters with a view to opening your mind a little, and with a view to thinking about the design.  http://technocracy-incorporated.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/Technocracy%2520study%2520guide.pdf
Technocracy%20study%20guide.pdf  There were 200 to 300,000 people for a while that thought this was not only the way to go but worked toward that end. Now there are 4 people on the NET site and Two people on the TechCa site that claim they and their 'belief system' , reward and punishment, 'contract', and church building, and referendum Democracy voting voting is 'smart'
These people are ignorant. You sound ignorant now also. Technocracy is important. It deserves to be fairly brought out. As to your suggestion about what I can do, you suck, and so does the horse you road in on.

In the HBO mini-series From the Earth to the Moon , a geology professor from Caltech met with Apollo 15 astronauts, and helped to raise their interest in the history and origin of granite. He pointed out that without a deep sense of observation, the astronauts would just be as good as small robots sent to the moon to collect rock samples.
All this says is """"some Caltech professor explained rocks and the importance of human observation to the astronauts"""". It certainly doesn't put across the degree of emphasis you suggest here. ∇∆∇∆ """,0.0

Calling it the white stolen generation doesn't exclude Aboriginals from being recognized, on the contrary it is the other way around. For example when the apology to the stolen generations was made was there any reference to white mothers or children? No there wasn't, only Aboriginals and TSI were recognized. Thus this is why the term """"white"""" stolen generation was created to help distinguish it.
Even Aboriginals recognize the white stolen generation by the following:
After the 2008 Apology to the Stolen Generation, Indigenous leader Max Dulumunmun Harrison, an elder of the Yuin people, helped bring it out last November, when he wrote: “I applaud the Prime Minister’s apology to our mob, but what about the white stolen generation that suffered the same fate?

 Inaccuracies in Modern day legacy: France 

Hello, to whomever may be watching this page. Although I have introduced myself elsewhere on Wikipedia, primarily on the SNCF page, this is my first message here. My name is Jerry Ray, and I am a consultant to SNCF, the French railway company, in Washington, DC. Last year I began reaching out to editors to help address inaccuracies related to the Holocaust in the SNCF article. Now I would like to bring editors' attention to similar issues within this article. 

As editors here will no doubt agree, this is a difficult subject, but one in which it is highly important to get the facts right. My aim here is to provide a revised version of the current """"Modern day legacy"""" section. This new version, with which I have had some assistance in researching and writing, represents an improvement in several ways. First, it presents a clearer overview of what was at stake in the Liepitz case. Second, it describes the US controversy more accurately, which was not limited to California. Third, it better describes how SNCF handled it and other viewpoints in the case, some of which is retained from the current entry. Lastly, there is a short final paragraph describing actions taken by SNCF in the modern era relating to this episode. 

Here is what I suggest:

{{Collapse|1=
France

In 2001, a lawsuit was filed against French government-owned rail company SNCF by Georges Lipietz, a Holocaust survivor, who was transported by SNCF to the Drancy internment camp in 1944. Lipietz was held at the internment camp for several months before the camp was liberated. After Lipietz's death the lawsuit was pursued by his family and in 2006 an administrative court in Toulouse ruled in favor of the Lipietz family. SNCF was ordered to pay 61,000 Euros in restitution. SNCF appealed the ruling at an administrative appeals court in Bordeaux, where in March 2007 the original ruling was overturned. According to historian Michael Marrus the court in Bordeaux """"declared the railway company had acted under the authority of the Vichy government and the German occupation"""" and as such could not be held independently liable.

Following the Lipietz trial, SNCF's involvement in World War II became the subject of attention in the United States when SNCF explored bids on rail projects in Florida and California, and SNCF's partly-owned subsidiary, Keolis Rail Services America bid on projects in Virginia and Maryland. While bidding on these rail contracts, SNCF was criticized for not formally acknowledging and apologizing for its involvement in World War II. In 2011, SNCF chairman Guillaume Pepy released a formal statement of regrets for the company's actions during World War II.{{cite news |title=SNCF, French Railro",0.0

LOL. Well, I was about to post this to the ANI thread below in response to Bbb23's 3RR analogy. It seems a shame to let it go to waste, particularly as it seems it was very prescient.

Here's an even better analogy. User A makes 4 reverts in 24 hours, without a valid reason. User B tells him that was a violation of 3RR, and not to do it again. User A tells him it wasn't, and gives a whole list of gobbledygook links as some kind of justification for the reverts, which to any normal user looks like nonsense, borne out of fundemental failure to understand both 3RR and all the other links they threw out there. User A then proceeds to make 4 further reverts. User B tells him he's incompetent, and advises them to buck their ideas up. User A gets upset and comes to ANI. User B has done nothing wrong, so stands by his actions. Users C/D/E/F/G/H form a kangaroo court, and while expressing no concern whatsoever about user A, proceed to focus solely on User B, full of their own self importance at their chance to fuck over someone with heavy doses of selective hearing/reading. Probable outcome: User B, a productive editor, decides that Wikipedia is a basket case with completely backwards priorities, and is lost to the project forever, either through force, or by his choice. User A continues to be an incompent editor, messes up a whole bunch more articles, and propogates his poor understanding of policy to even less experienced users by spreading it all over random talk pages. Long term, User A either finally learns the ropes, having no doubt destroyed an unknowable amount of content and confused an unknowable amount of inexperienced editors in the meantime, or they screw up and they get blocked after applying their incompetence to a disupte which involves some power user or other, and finally gets the block they deserve, still no doubt not having any idea what they've done wrong, because here's the kicker - they have been incompetent all along.   

With that, I'm out of here. You all have fun now editting articles while others who don't know a BLP from a loaf of bread get in your way, and when you highlight it, it's dismissed as nothing but a """"content dispute"""". Good job everyone!""",0.0

While it's clear that the new editors' behaviour is inappropriate, I'd be remiss if I didn't also suggest to you that you might want to be a bit more careful in the future not to get involved in discussions where you might be perceived as having a personal bias. Whether you do or don't isn't even really the point — sometimes all that's necessary to spark this kind of ruckus is the perception that you have a vested interest. They obviously believe that your nomination was politically motivated rather than based on a neutral assessment of Wikipedia policy.

In future, it might be best to just avoid putting yourself in a situation where your motivations might be questioned in this way. You can always ask other editors, or the Canadian notice board, to review a situation if you think your motivations for proposing a course of action might be questioned.

Hello Ceekay89. I just saw you started adding content to NVA Entertainment Group, and also saw the page has been speedy deleted before. I added a speedy-delete tag because the relevance and significance of the articles subject is not established, see Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#A7.

"Sorry dude, as a physicist I know that there is not any generally accepted position on whether the universe had a prime mover or whether one was necessary or not or whether there is a necessary being.  Our only two cites for this section, which claims the argument has been scientifically refuted, which is not true, are a popular science book and a popular science lecture.  Now I'm not disrespecting Kaku or Hawking, but Hawking's statement that there was not time before the universe began is not his, it goes back to Augustine of Hippo, which Hawking says in I believe A Brief History of Time, and so is not in opposition to any basic Christian philosophy about God.  And as I pointed out, physicists and cosmologists do investigate what might have happened before the big bang.  It's not a scientifically meaningless question as this section is trying to claim.  And Kaku's description of the molecules in the jar not being moved, as I pointed out, is not motion from nothing.  The molecules had to have a probability or potential to move.  The reason things can move without another body moving them is they had a probability to move based on the uncertainty principle.  When you ask physicists why a particle just started moving or why for instance the particles are generated in a vacuum, they would say because of the uncertainty principle and the laws of quantum physics.  That's implying a cause.  There was a cause for the motion or the creation, not something out of nothing.  Now laws of physics and probabilities are not nothing.  And where did they come from?  Hawking I believe in a actual paper he wrote had the universe jumpstarted from a primeordial wave function, see Hartle-Hawking state, but where did that come from?  And this idea, as most ideas about the initial conditions of the universe, has been in no way accepted by all or even most scientists.  So unless it can be shown from a credible cited source that the vast majority of physicists and cosmologists hold that the cosmological argument has actually been scientifically refuted, not that they just don't personally accept it or something like that, we should not be making that claim.  For instance the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy makes no such claim, and has several pros and cons for the argument based on modern science, including the example of vacuum motion and vacuum genesis.  And as for popular science sources, Carl Sagan always held that the idea of a creator and generator of the universe had neither been proven nor disproven by science.",0.0

I hope you enjoy editing here and being a Wikipedian! Please sign your name on talk pages using four tildes (~~~~); this will automatically produce your name and the date. If you need help, check out Wikipedia:Questions, ask me on my talk page, or place {{helpme}} on your talk page and someone will show up shortly to answer your questions. Again, welcome! 

The reason I am leaving this welcome message is because I noticed your additions to Mumia Abu-Jamal.  Thanks for you additions, and I hope you continue to contribute here, but I'm letting you know that I removed what you added for a couple of reasons.  First of all, the additions were from a very strong point-of-view (POV) and here in Wikipedia we strive to only add information which is from a Neutral Point of View.  Please read that policy if you have time and it might make things clearer.

Also, another problem with the addition is that it is almost a verbatim copy of this web page; we are not allowed to violate whatever copyright that site holds on the information.  Moreover, I think it should be clear that we should not directly add information from freemumia.com into Wikipedia, this web site will of course have a strong POV and a reason for writing what they do.

Again, I encourage you to continue to contribute to Wikipedia, but please understand that we must strive to give an NPOV presentation.  That is what makes this an encyclopedia and not someone's blog.  Cheers,   (Talk)",0.0

If I never questioned the statement that E3b is """"common"""" in Europe to begin with (although I did say the word was vague) it would indeed be odd if I then went on to say that the statement is extreme. How could something be vague be extreme? I also, to say it once more, do not question that the referenced source about Pakistan might indeed have said that """"E3b is common in Europe"""" though referring to what we can also read in articles about more specifically about Europe. So I am questioning the type of referencing in the Wikipedia of which this is a discussion page, which seems extreme. Nothing else. Please address that. I have also explained specifically why I think this. Please read what I wrote again and respond to what I really wrote? The way I understand it, an article on Pakistan is being used simply in order to justify the word """"common"""", whereas the articles about Europe, which both the Wikipedia article and the Pakistan E3b article must refer to, perhaps do not use that exact word, but rather give more detailed and less vague numbers and comments? If this is so, then maybe that is the way we should go - less vague?  """,0.0

Evils of Atheism

It's about damn time somebody taught atheists their own medicine, and before you ask, I do not generalize, I think there's a cultural distinction between atheism and nonbelievers. Atheists tend to be enraged over religion of any kind, and spend a lot of time elevating Darwin and bemoaning the Crusades. Nonbelievers in general - say, someone who's raised a Christian, believes the Bible is an allegory, and only attends church for a funeral or perhaps at Christmastime - tend to adopt a """"Whatever gets you through the night"""" philosophy and be quiet on matters of faith. It's sort of like the difference between a devout vegetarian and someone who hates the taste of meat. Atheists are proud of their hate. It is something that they love devoutly and use it to hate christians.""",0.14285714285714285

1.  Gwen Gale has dominated the article “Death of Adolf Hitler” for years.

2.  Gwen Gale is not informed about the “Death of Adolf Hitler”.

"Could anyone explain me what happened on the film commentary? At the beginning Vince Vaughn started eating chips. Then Ben Stiller arrived 10 minutes after the commentary started and then started arguing with the director Rawson Marshall Thurber and even burping sometimes. After about 25 minutes Thurber becomes very annoyed with the stupidity of Ben Stiller and leaves the studio. Then both Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn did anything besides commenting the film, with Vaughn even threatening the crew at the studio. After about 40 minutes from the beginning of the commentary a woman comes in the studio and tells Ben that if he doesn't move his car it will be towed. After this both Stiller and Vaughn leave the studio with almost an hour left in the film! The two men of the studio crew then, in total embarassment, put on the commentary of There's Something about Mary. This proves the complete unprofessionality of Vaughn and Stiller. They behaved awfully, Stiller, after 5 minutes of his arrival wanted to leave and Vaughn insulted one of the studio crew members and, after Thurber went away they began criticizing him. This episode totally changed my perception of Stiller.",0.0

"""== Purges in the Red Army ==

The late 1930s saw the so-called """"Purges of the Red Army cadres"""", occurring against the historical background of the Great Purge. The Purges had the objective of cleansing the Red Army of the """"politically unreliable element"""", mainly among the higher-ranking officers. This inevitably provided a convenient pretext for settling personal vendettas and eventually resulted in a witch hunt. Some observers believe that the Purges weakened the Red Army considerably, but this remains a hotly debated subject. Many commentators overlook the fact that the Red Army grew significantly in numbers during the peak of the Purges. In 1937, the Red Army numbered around 1.3 million, and it grew to almost three times that number by June 1941. This necessitated quick promotion of junior officers, often despite their lack of experience or training, with obvious grave implications. In another important consideration, by the end of the Purges the pendulum swung back, restoring and promoting many of the purged officers.

Recently declassified data indicate that in 1937, during the culmination of the Purges, the Red Army had 114,300 officers, of whom 11,034 suffered repression and did not gain rehabilitation until 1940. Yet, in 1938, the Red Army had 179,000 officers (56% more compared to 1937), of whom a further 6,742 suffered repression and did not gain rehabilitation until 1940

In the highest echelons of the Red Army the Purges removed 3 of 5 marshals, 13 of 15 army generals, 8 of 9 admirals, 50 of 57 army corps generals, 154 out of 186 division generals, 16 of 16 army commissars, and 25 of 28 army corps commissars.

"Why Lineal shouldn't be here 

Let's go back to when the Lineal/The Ring title didn't exist. Back then, there was only a World Champion.

Then the title's were split. First between the WBA (Known also by othernames) and WBC, then later the IBF was recognized and even later the WBO.

When the titles were first split, The Ring Magazine created a The Ring title. This belt was awarded to all reigning World Champions. Challengers could win it by beating them. Should someone vacate it, the only way to win it would be to be recognized by The Ring as the No.1 or No.2 fighter in your division and beat the other man ranked 1 or 2 (Some exceptions were made for No.3)

Then came the unfortunate decision in the 1990s by The Ring to stop awarding these titles. But they did not stop ranking fighters. When the No.1 and No.2 fighters fought and a victor came out, that person was dubbed the Lineal Champion.

An example is Floyd Mayweather, Jr.; Lineal Super Featherweight Champion from 1998-2001 (Ring belts were awarded again in 2002).

Mayweather worked his way up to the No.2 spot and challenged No.1 and WBC Champion Genaro Hernández. He was considered the Lineal Champion because there was no The Ring Champion.

Naseem Hamed won the Lineal title and lost it in a period when The Ring titles weren't being awarded. The man who beat him for his title, Marco Antonio Barrera, was later awarded The Ring title. His Lineal title was switched with the The Ring title because the Lineal title only existed as a substitute. 

This applies for Lennox Lewis. He was awarded the The Ring title when awarding them began again in 2002. Therefore, the Lineal title was NOT on the line in his fight with Vitali Klitschko. Any objections?",0.0

 Brian Chen's analysis of Apple and Flash 

The article quotes Brian Chen:
Allowing Flash — which is a development platform of its own — would just be too dangerous for Apple, a company that enjoys exerting total dominance over its hardware and the software that runs on it. Flash has evolved from being a mere animation player into a multimedia platform capable of running applications of its own. That means Flash would open a new door for application developers to get their software onto the iPhone: Just code them in Flash and put them on a web page. In so doing, Flash would divert business from the App Store, as well as enable publishers to distribute music, videos and movies that could compete with the iTunes Store.
Because this quote is heavy in opinion, analysis, and POV – in other words, unbalanced – I think it's best to summarize the author's factual statements and use a short quote to capture the tone of the source. Including the full quote compromises the article's neutral POV.

I replaced the text with this, which was 
In November 2010, a Wired columnist said """"allowing Flash — which is a development platform of its own — [on the iPhone] would just be too dangerous for Apple, a company that enjoys exerting total dominance over its hardware and the software that runs on it,"""" and that it would allow developers to circumvent Apple's App Store.

moonless night.

In the middle of the night, Watson is suddenly, and perhaps even indignantly
awakened, by the famed detective, who says to him, """"Watson, look up at the
night sky, and tell me what you deduce?"""" To which Watson, rubbing his eyes
for a moment, responds, saying, """"Well, let me see now. There are stars,
countless stars in the sky, and I can even see the Milky Way galaxy. And so,
if those stars that I can see clearly with the naked eye are themselves only
a small fraction of the total number of stars, then by logical deduction
there may be and likely are countless more that I cannot see. Now, if only a
small percentage of those stars were to have planets, and of those, if only
a small portion would to contain solar systems like our own, and of all of
THOSE stars, even if only a small portion were to contain planets similar to
ours, which have the capability to house life, and THEN IF, of all THOSE
living planets encircling THOSE stars, there were some, which were able to
house intelligent life, then I would be forced to conclude by logical
inference, that there may be countless stars, around which circle planets
just like ours housing intelligent sentient life forms, perhaps not unlike
ourselves even, right here, and now.

But - quite surprisingly - those trains (the majority of the G's) that I believe are going to Shanghai Hongqiao Railway Station are shown as arriving to some place called """"上海东"""" (""""Shanghai East"""") instead! So apparently this is how tielu.org chose to call the new Hongqiao Station... Moreover, Wuhan's two """"old"""" stations, the Wuchang Railway Station and the Hankou Railway Station got new monikers as well - 武汉南 (""""Wuhan South"""") and 武汉西 (""""Wuhan West"""") respectively! (See e.g. the schedule for D3010, Wuchang - Shanghai Hongqiao, or, under tielu.org's new dispensation, """"Wuhan West - Shanghai East"""". Now, I have used the tielu.org site long enough, and know that until quite recently Wuchang and Hankou always appeared there under their usual names, none of this """"Wuhan West"""" / """"Wuhan South"""" business.  A quick web search did not find anything particularly useful about this matter, other than a few people's comments on the 武汉南 label for the Wuchang Station on a discussion forum.

Oh right, my pen-name is The Persian Cataphract, so let me try to decipher your next tactical move. The race card? Oh right, your name's not Al Sharpton or Jesse Jackson. Let me guess the next one. Nationalist. That's right, you'll throw each and every syllable of content present in my message, in favour of this preconceived straw-man, fallacy and red herring. You'll probably even point to my liberal use of profanity. I just must be nothing else than this lion-and-sun foam-at-mouth Persian nationalist with an inferiority complex spiced with a pinch of victim mentality. And certainly I must be dumb, as you so eloquently have arbitrated above.

You said it yourself, right here:

...I am used to being attacked by editors whose very account names show they are here for single-topic pov-pushing. Who do you expect to be neutral on topics of Iranian nationalism? A user called """"IranianGuy"""", or a Swiss editor contributing under his real name and no stakes in the matter? Who, for that matter, do you expect to be neutral on topics of Armenian nationalism, an editor called """"AraratArev"""" (vel sim.)...

Is that how you assess content? By making a shallow assumption on pen-names? Expectations? The God-given right to anonymity on the Internet? How fucking petty are you and the idiot who made you an administrator? What next, are you going to ban Iranians from editing or contributing to Iran-related articles? Indeed not just a laughable policy, but indeed a dangerous one as well. Most of the world-class authorities are Iranians. With your fucked up logic, we should dismiss their contributions because irrespective of their content, you'll instead look at their political affiliations and their names and put it into the bin of rejection. Oh right, you're Swiss and because Switzerland is this shining paragon of neutrality hosting thousands of bank accounts of Islamic terror organization, you're obviously this stereotypical neutralist... Good lord, listen to yourself. 

Luckily academia doesn't work like that. Scholarly enterprise and political affiliations remain strictly separated. So it doesn't really matter if Kaveh Farrokh or anyone else is a self-declared outspoken Nazi, Communist, Socialist, Liberal, Conservative or what have you, it has no bearing on content that must be assessed purely by content. That's NPOV. A sober, neutral, objective approach, just bare-bones, bare-knuckles source critique. Source. Critique. Make an assessment on the content, not the person(s). You marginalized IranianGuy. Period. And as conveniently as you shrugged him off because of his pen-name, you shrugged off his fully legitimate criticism of your approach. No matter what country or pen-name or real name you have, it has a universal stamp: Asshole behaviour.

OK, I just tried to merge Cloud telephony into Web-based VoIP, and it did not work.  The reason is that the intros in both of those articles did not correctly define the concepts.  
 Cloud telephony is a subset of Cloud communications; it means third-party, off-site VoIP services in general.  This includes both web-based and non-web-based VoIP (it could just integrate with conventional telephones as a PBX replacement).
 Web-based VoIP simply uses a web page running a multimedia applet or whatever instead of dedicated non-web VoIP software

I propose merging Cloud telephony into Cloud communications instead; they are both very short and weak and there is substantial overlap.  I tagged both of those articles.

There is no section in Voice over IP into which to merge Web-based VoIP, since it defines a class of client software; though I did add an awkward link from the """"Protocols"""" section.  Clients are described at Comparison of VoIP software.  Web-based software is included there but not necessarily marked as such.  That's another potential merge target, but I don't have any problem leaving web-based VoIP as its own article for a while and letting it grow.  It may be handy to just be able to link there from several other articles. I removed the merge tag from Web-based VoIP for now, but feel free to rekindle the debate if you see fit.    """,0.0

 Comment intended for Schlafly page 
I received a 7-day block for my previous comments, and now an indefinite block. Here
is a comment that I intended for the Schlafly talk page.

I believe that the Phyllis Schlafly article falsely maligns Schlafly by misinterpreting a NY Times book review.

 The article implies that Schlafly opposed Nixon over """"segregation and discrimination"""",
while the source only says that she was with conservatives who were going to oppose whatever Rockefeller proposed.
 The article relies on a Jewish NY Times columnist raising a Jewish issue,
without mentioning that the columnist is a Jew who writes about Jewish issues, and that no one else raises this Jewish issue.
 The article implies that Schlafly used Jewish code words, while the source
does not explicitly say so. All the source really says is that her opinion is that
the biography should have commented on the matter further.

Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view demands both stories side by side
That means both the terror terror story and that what actually happened. This also means there is no need to continue the debate about terror, as it is much more important to get the whole secondary explanation on the page.

Any material that is challenged and for which no source is provided may be removed by any editor. So we don't need a poll, all we need is to remove a lot of things from the page. It needs to be rewritten having both published versions, the scientific one and the warmongering story.

Here are some references:

[]
Why the 9/11 Conspiracy Theories Won't Go Away makes it clear there are 2 mainstream views that should be displayed side by side attributing as much hardcoded quotations as possible. 

[]

Around 75 top professors and leading scientists believe the attacks were puppeteered by war mongers in the White House to justify the invasion and the occupation of oil-rich Arab countries.

Unless anyone has a good reason not to add those to the page and not to mention this documented information?

William Rodríguez RICO lawsuit
In October 2004, Rodríguez filed a civil RICO lawsuit directed against George W. Bush, Richard B. Cheney, Donald H. Rumsfeld and others, including a total of 100 defendants, together with Ellen Mariani and lawyer Phil Berg. The government filed a motion to dismiss, or at least transfer, the case on grounds of national security. is worthy of it's own paragraph.

no Osama means no Muslims
[FBI says]: The reason why 9/11 is not mentioned on Usama Bin Laden’s Most Wanted page is because the FBI has no hard evidence connecting Bin Laden to 9/11 thus the word Muslim may only be quoted at best.

The use of the word terrorist
Similarities between the Reichstag fire and The September 11 Attacks are as striking as those between the Reichstag Fire Decree and the Patriot act there is no need to use the word terrorist to explain the event, I do think a separate paragraph dedicated to the media calling it a Muslim terrorist attack would be appropriate. Wikipedia:Avoid_peacock_terms Let the facts speak for themselves..

Wikipedia:No original research

As long as it's not in a peer review journal kerosene cant melt reinforced steel. 
Structural failure
In a well-designed system, a localized failure should not cause immediate or even progressive collapse of the entire structure.

Which makes this pseudoscience: September_11_attacks#The_attacks: Three buildings in the World Trade Center Complex collapsed due to structural failure on the day of the attack. Because that is not what the structural failure of well designed systems works like in any previous historical event. Here the standards of wikipedia go far beyond those of the mainstream media. The buildings where blown up.

Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words
Avoid phrases such as """"some people say"""" without sources.. 
Hiding all the evidence incriminates the Bush administration. Further evidence of anything is just weasel wording. Hijackers, fires, explosions, demolition all perfectly good to describe the story.

Thanks again , the mid-19th century embellishing has been sort of attributed to John Elkington Gill, but that seems to be based on no more the fact that he worked on the nearby parish church. My guess if that looking at the architecture, Raikes Davy designed it himself and probably got a surveyor or perhaps even Gill to draw up some working plans. I'll keep searching. If there's any clues, they are in that strange tower, which is why I likened it to the work of Alexander Thomson, but that's more for explaining to readers the ideas and architectural concepts that were floating about at that time, rather than suggesting he designed it - it's not accomplished enough for him anyway.

Hi there, I see you've been having some trouble with adding the attendance to the Hawthorn vs. West Coast match. The reason that it kept being removed is one of Wikipedia's core policies, Wikipedia:Verifiability, which means we can't add any information to articles that isn't supported by a reference in a reliable source. Editors are actually encouraged to remove information that isn't verified (that being said, it is almost always more productive to start a dialogue than blindly revert). Anyway, I saw you add the info back, so I added a reference to it so it doesn't get reverted again. I encourage you to add references yourself in future, so that hopefully this doesn't happen again (and please note that references don't have to be online, they can be offline, such as the reference I added to the 2011 season article).

"Neurodevelopmental insults 

I would like to suggest that the first paragraph of this article describe schizophrenia as a neurodevelopmental disease, possibly in addition to being a mental illness. I am reading the book Origins of Schizophrenia''', published 2012 by Columbia University Press, and chapter 1 (page 25) says [quote]In recent years, evidence has accumulated in support of a role for neurodevelopmental insults in the etiopathogenesis of schizophrenia (Brown, 2011). The dramatic changes in brain structure and function cron conception to birth underscore the particular vulnerability to insults during this stage of development with regard to both short- and long-term disease outcomes (Tau & Peterson, 2010). Hence, the determinants of detal brain development- both genes and environmental factors- deserve consideration as potential risk factors for schizophrenia.[/quote] This scholarly book is summarizing the most recent scientific consensus on this terrible disease and it is pointing to schizophrenia as a neurological issue more than it is a mental health issue.

Hello, and welcome to Wikipedia!

I hope that I don't seem unfriendly or make you feel unwelcome, but I noticed your username, and I am concerned that it might not meet Wikipedia's username policy for the following reason: Your username appears to represent an organization that you are promoting. First, you shouldn't write articles about yourself, or your organization. Second, usernames must correspond to individuals (for legal license reasons), so having a username for your group would be against our policies.. After you look over that policy, could we discuss that concern here?

I'd appreciate learning your views, for instance, your reasons for wanting this particular name, and what alternative username you might accept that avoids raising this concern.

There are several options available to you:
 We can talk about it, here. 
 You can abandon the contributions made under this name and create a new account that meets our username policy and addresses the concern(s) noted above.
 Or, if you want to keep your contributions history under a new name, then you should visit Wikipedia:Changing username and follow the instructions there.

If we can't resolve this on our own, we can ask for help through Wikipedia's dispute resolution process, such as requesting comments from other Wikipedians.  Wikipedia administrators usually abide by agreements reached through this process.      """,0.0

 Scientists Discuss """"Evolution"""" 

“My attempts to demonstrate evolution by an experiment carried on for more than 40 years have completely failed. It is not even possible to make a caricature of an evolution out of paleobiological facts. The idea of an evolution rests on pure belief”. (Nils Heribert Nilsson, noted Swedish botanist and geneticist, of Lund University and evolutionist).

“I think in fifty years, Darwinian evolution will be gone from the science curriculum. I think people will look back on it and ask how anyone could, in their right mind, have believed this, because it's so implausible when you look at the evidence”. (Johnathan Wells, 'Icons of Evolution').

“I have come to the conclusion that Darwinism is not a testable scientific theory, but a metaphysical research program”. (Karl Popper, German born philosopher of science, called by Nobel Prize winner Peter Medawar, 'Incomparably the greatest philosopher of science who has ever lived').

“Scientists who go about teaching that evolution is a fact of life are great con-men, and the story they are telling may be the greatest hoax ever! In explaining evolution we do not have one iota of fact”. (Newton Tahmisian, Atomic Energy Commission).

“The pathetic thing about it is that many scientists are trying to prove the doctrine of evolution, which no science can do”. (Robert A. Milikan, physicist by provision and a Nobel Prize winner, speech before the American Chemical Society).

“The miracles required to make evolution feasible are far greater in number and far harder to believe than the miracle of creation”. (Richard Bliss, former professor of biology and science education as Christian Heritage College, ‘It Takes a Miracle for Evolution).

“The only competing explanation for the order we all see in the biological world is the notion of special creation”. (Colin Patterson, evolutionist and senior Paleontologist at the British Museum of Natural History, which houses more than 60.000.000 fossils).

“Evolution is a fairy tale for grown ups. This theory has helped nothing in the progress of science. It is useless”. (Prof. Louis Bounoure, Director of Research, National Center of Scientific Research).

“All of us who study the origin of life find that the more we look into it, the more we feel it is too complex to have evolved anywhere. We all believe as an article of faith that life evolved from dead matter on this planet. It is just that life’s complexity is so great, it is hard for us to imagine that it did”. (Dr. Harold Urey, Nobel Prize winner).

“A growing number of respectable scientists are defecting from the evolutionist camp, moreover, for the most part these ‘Experts’ have abandoned Darwinism, not on the basis of religious faith or biblical persuasions, but on strictly scientific grounds, and in some instances, regretfully”. (Dr. Wolfgang Smith, physicist and mathematician).

“The evolution theory is purely the product of the imagination”. (Dr. Ambrose Flemming, Pres. Philosophical Society of United Kingdom).

“I have always been slightly suspicious of the theory of evolution because of its ability to account for any property of living beings. I have therefore tried to see whether biological discoveries over the last thirty years or so fit in with Darwin’s theory. I do not think that they do. To my mind, the theory does not stand up at all”. (H. Lipson, “A Physicist Looks at Evolution“, Physic Bulletin, Page 138).

“The talk of evolution is sheer nonsense not founded on observation and wholly unsupported by fact. This Museum is full of proof of the utter falsity of their view”. (Niles Ethredge, British Museum of Science).

“(Evolution is) a great cosmologic myth of the twentieth century”. (Michael Denton, molecular biochemist, ‘Evolution, Theory in Crisis’).

“The evolutionary establishment fears creation science, because evolution itself crumbles when challenged by evidence. In the 1970s and 1980s, hundreds of public debates were arranged between evolutionary scientists and creation scientists. The latter scored resounding victories, with the result that, today, few evolutionists will debate. Isaac Asimov, Stephen Jay Gould, and the late Carl Sagan, while highly critical of creationism, all declined to debate”. (James Perloff, ‘Tornado in a Junkyard’, This book was published in the year 1999, Page 241).

“Evolution is faith, a religion”. (Louis T. More, professor of paleontology at Princeton University).

“Evolution is baseless and quite incredible”. (John Ambrose, ‘The Unleashing of Evolutionary Thought’).

“Darwinism itself has become a religion”. (Norman Macbeth).

“There is no evidence, scientific or otherwise, to support the theory of evolution”. (Cecil Wakely).

"""Saab lofton was a radio personality for about two months of his before loosing his show on digital radio network. He will not provide proof of his comic roofis (as in did he actuall draw it himself or did he contract out the work while writing the storie. Both of his books (pamplets) are home published and could be considered very racist! This is not someone that has any creditibily as he has lied several times on his wikipedia page.

No RESULTS!
On June 12th, 2008 GLOBETREKER says:
This is not an example and cannot be proven that YOU actually drew THE strip.

Like I said I have been informed this comic in nothing more than 2 or 3 sheets of zerox paper stapled together. Not in the usual format as a printed affair. He uses the term loosely since it’s not a real printed comic. He has no examples of his drawing, what kind of cartoonist doesn’t put their work online. PROVE THAT SHIT!

He stated in this post to Wikipedia that his book Battle Neverending’s 3 thousand copies sold out in one year which is a total lie. He printed them in 1998 and was still selling them as recent as 2006

http://www.popocculture.com/28/battle-neverending-by-saab-l

“Jarvis Marlow is the man who paid out of his own pocket for the second printing (one thousand copies) and third printing (two thousand copies) of Battle Neverending. I sold all three thousand copies of Btl Nvrg within the span of a year”. 

(Example #1 of his lies)

2000 copies of A.D. supposedly sold in one year or as Saab states (Record Time) which is also unverifiable whether it actually sold that fast since he out an out lied about Battle Neverendings.
The first A.D. was published by a small defunct anarchist publisher which describes itself as publishing """"pamphlets"""", sold out and was not reprinted.

“However, his claim to fame is the novel he wrote while still in the dorms at San Francisco State University, A.D., which was so radical a book it got him kicked out of college in 1997.”

When in reality

“Lofton wrote """"A.D."""" while a student at San Francisco State University and spent so much time hawking the book when it was published three years ago that his grades began to fall and the university cut off his financial aid”.

(Example #2 of his lies)

I ‘m not admitting any mistake about BERKELEY (you always want to appear very radical so I’m sure you told him you were homeless on the streets of Berkeley) because you made that up as well as being homeless! The only place you’ve been homeless was on your mothers couch for THREE YEARS ALL THE WHILE REFUSING TO WORK A DAY JOB, IM SURE TO YOUR MOTHERS AMAZEMENT ON JUST HOW MUCH OF A BUM HER SON TURNED OUT TO BE!

(Example #3 of his lies)

“In all the WEEKS you've been STALKING me, NOT ONE motherfucker has so much as e-mailed me and asked, """"is this anonymous, psuedonym-using piece of shit correct about anything?""""”.

I know nobody reads your shit anyway so I wouldn’t expect any response. I write these things simply because I know that you can’t handle risking your supposed fame! (Which is all you are interested in anyway). Your not an activist you’re an opportunist masking yourself in anarchy.

And finally I have this victory over your Racist Spoiled Black Privileged ass!

Here’s the dialog about shutting Saabs Wikepedia page because firstly it’s chalked full of made up shit and secondly they finally realize that he’s just another home publishing hack!

I've looked into the books listed in the bibliography... The first was published by a small defunct anarchist publisher which describes itself as publishing """"pamphlets"""", sold out and was not reprinted. The second was described by Pop Occulture Magazine as """"obviously a low-budget and quite-possibly home-printed affair"""". There is no evidence that either of these books received a credible review, much less meet WP:BOOK. Journalists are a dime-a-dozen and not automatically notable, and these books don't appear to establish notability either.

Therefore I am proposing deletion of the article. If the tag is remove, would someone please nominate for deletion? I can't as I can't create the deletion page... 67.67.219.223 (talk)

  Look, I understand that Wikipedia doesn't try to add to knowledge, and only reports on what already exists. I brought up all of my little scenarios about being a preacher or author or internet essayist to prove a common point- it's not like an idea has to be written down to exist.
  I just wrote a lengthy counter argument but then realized that I was essentially restating what I had said before, and so the whole thing would be of no aid.

I mean, angel means messenger, so how is it impossible that some Biblical passages concerning angels aren't actually speaking about human messengers? Tell me. Prove me wrong. If angel means messenger then how can it perhaps not sometimes be referring to human messengers? Say something better than """"the onus is on you"""", because the argument is airtight- I already proved it. If I didn't then simply say what is illogical in my reasoning. I think that my contributions were blocked mostly because you don't agree with me.
  And I think Wikipedia's sourcing policy is illogical. I know that if I were to write a book with my opinions in it and then quote it on Wikipedia saying, """"page 10 of John Smith's book says..."""" it would not be blocked, because it is 100% true that my book would have those contents.

In this change, Mike Halterman says """"no need to go through redirects, the point of piped links is for them to go to the correct name"""".

Yes, I know, but as I cited above, the disambiguation guidelines appear to recommend having the DAB page link to the """"full"""" name rather than to directly to the real name.  Rome (disambiguation) links to Rome, Italy even though the real article is at Rome.

Now, maybe you're saying that as long as I needed a piped link to satisfy MoS:DAB#Piping exception #3

I might as well go directly to the """"right"""" page.

Note a later sentence in MoS:DAB:
This guidance to avoid piping means that a link to a redirect term will sometimes be preferred to a direct link, if the redirect term contains the disambiguation title and the redirect target does not.
That could be read two ways:  as a way to avoid piping, or as a preference for linking to the disambiguated name in preference to the ambiguous one.

"""Also it is a neutral point of view to say something can be played. Playable means not winning losing or drawing. Just playable. The Krabbe site agrees. Its you that does not and you push your POV with a dusty old Kaufman line. He got awarded his GM title because he won a tournament for old people FYI. His line is dusty and old. You should actually sit down, look at the analysis and just undo your own revisions yourself. But I have a feeling you know me personally and I even think I know who you are. I have a few guesses. The non-neutral point of view is to insist something is traditionally refuted when I supplied evidence to the contrary. You insist that something is refuted in a way that it is not. This is not WP:NPOV it is very biased. It is YOUR point of view. You are not a grandmaster. If you were you would have looked at my revision in your head. Or if you were, you would have looked at my site. Krabbe himself says he would be interested in playing it. Winds analysis was improved on by me. If you look at the analysis you will see that Houdini thinks everything I came up with is sound.

Edits in history of the tank

A while back you added some considerable information to the section /*Between the Wars*/, which was more in its place in the Tanks (1919-1939) article. I've moved/merged this information into the latter article and would appreciate it if you could look over both articles to see if nothing has been lost or inadvertely been duplicated?  

 Thanks, I made a few edits to it. I also removed a few small items that were correct, but not 'between the wars' info.  

 Superdeng warned 

 

 This and that 

Firstly, I edited a chapter of my Meltyukhov translation a couple of days ago, but lamentably after my last save the Word annaounced that the file was 'corrupt'. Problems emerged while I was trying to send it via mail, as the copy of text I tried to add from recovered version of this 'corrupt' file was declared to 'contain no data'. The same thing occured, as I tried to post the whole text into my wikipage. I don't know what to do about it, I actually need this text for preparing an article in wikipedia as well (rough notes on my page) .

Secondly, (another unpleasant news) 'our mutual friend' Deng has become active again! See his changes to WW2 Eastern front proposal page. 

(Is it necessary to add, that he is obviously trying to revive the old story of 'bad Germanns and goodd Soviets'? He replaced a paragraph on Vlasov etc with his version of the events (a rather belletristic 'improvement', BTW), and usual English with his understanding of the English grammar...)  - Talk

 GREEN POLITICS AND BIAS CLOUDS THIS ARTICLE. 

Too much of this article is about petty environmental politics and in-fighting, with a bias against Moore.

The article should be about the man and his views, not about why some environmentalists disagree with him. Much of the latter part of the article has the tone of putting up Moore for criticism and then criticising him. The section """"Criticism by other environmentalist"""" does not belong at all, certainly not as a seperate section. The article should not be a """"for"""" and """"against"""" debate.

It is petty politics when some environmentalists object against describing him as an """"environmentalist"""" simply because he has alternate views on method and tactics (albeit critical views).

Example of bias:
Under the heading """"Views"""", we do not get an insight into Moore's views, (vision, ideology, tactics, philosophy etc), what we get is only Moore's views in opposition to the environmental movement.

An example of subtle bias:

""""Moore is supported by the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI), a national organization of pro-nuclear industries which hopes to enlist Moore's help in bringing about a nuclear renaissance.[22]""""

(Note that the link [22] is broken).
The fact that an organisation supports Moore, and """"hope"""" to enlist him, does not establish any alliance between Moore and them.
This is clearly an attempt to establish guilt by association, by those who are against nuclear as a green option. 
The factual information is as follows (from Wikipedia):
""""NEI founded the Clean and Safe Energy Coalition (CASEnergy) to help build local support around the country for new nuclear build. The co-chairs of the coalition are Greenpeace co-founder Patrick Moore..""""

The statement in this article should be replaced by stating Moore's proper association and the relevant context i.e. why he supports them or what they stand for, e.g. Clean and Safe Energy.""",0.0

 Re: Justification for comment left which took the piss out of everything to do with your faith it seems

Well, that was longer than I anticipated for a title. Oh well. Anyway, do you think I am an arrogant, 'shithead' by reading that? or just a tad 'rant'headed?

Sorry, but your comment was abusive to me aswell, mate. 'I think you should tell him how to treat people'. Okay, I might of took the piss out of some person and I don't know if I did the 'christian' """"faith"""" aswell, I can't remeber to be honest.

But anyway, Justification...I am nice anyhow, but do get pissed. When I get pissed off with people, I get nasty. I was reading Aristophanes earlier that day (thats why it was in a poem). And all my poems have Underlying critical elements or 'praise' in them. You got the 'abusive tone' of the poem, but probably not the underlying bit. Or by the reaction of the first, you be deeply off the scale. I wonder what I said what made the 'christians' came into factor...I really can't remeber. Dam should've saved it. 

About the 'tell him that capps are for shotuing on the internet', I know that all ready. I used it for something called 'emphasis, may of heard it. Also, I was FUCKING PISSED AT THE TIME SO YOU DO FUCKING SHOUT AND SWEAR. don't you? yep...if you don't, your not human...well the swearing part you can reframe from. But your a man, so swearing is allowed. Only women where you say 'sorry for my french' (again justification, I am english that is a phrase over here > i am not just digging at the french)

So, yeah...I was on a rant for a bit...won't happen again. Unless a person is abusive to me.

"""::::1. Croats had, according to the DAI, been a fighting folk who subdued Avars, repelled Franks and saved Serbs from Bulgarian captivity 

2. Serbs were a docile folk who, essentially, didn't fight """"their place under the sun"""". Their very name signified servitude of a sort, as evidenced by the DAI's etymology. They lost every battle  with foreigners they ever fought, placed themselves under Byzantine suzerainty amd were saved from extinction by Croats who crushed Bulgarian aggression

3. there are historical documents galore, which testify about Croatian legal, parliamentary and cultural continuity: from the times of Trpimir and Krešimir to the later corpora.

4. Croatian language heritage in the vernacular is well attested in from the 13th century on (at least). They Croatian name is explicitly mentioned in various sources, both Čakavian and Štokavian, particularly in Dalmatia, Dubrovnik and Bosnia. Moreover, linguistic characteristics are the same as with contemporary (mid-19th century) Croatian language. On the other hand, Serbian written works, up until Dositej and Vuk (1780-1820), were written exclusively in Church Slavic language. Serbian literature until Vuk is, essentially, a variant of Church Slavic literature flourishing in Byzantium influenced area. Hence-Vuk's linguistic pan-Serbism, which tried to appropriate all štokavian vernacular literature is, evidently, a falsity and concoction.

5. early Slavic studies (Šarařik et al.) were deluded in ascribing parts of the Croatian literature to the Serbian heritage.

6. Serbian ethnic affiliation, in modern terms, is a relatively new phenomenon in Croatia. The major part of Eastern Orthodox inhabitants of Croatia, who actively participated in the Croatian cultural life (Illyrian movemont) have begun to show Serbian national allegiance only in recent (1850s) years. 

Virtually all Starčević's claims are corroborated by historical sources available at his times. Whether the veracity of historical sources like the DAI can withstand the test of time-this is another question. But, from the vantage point of mid-19th century clash of Serbian and Croatian ideologies, Starčević polemic stands as an example of skilled, sometimes sardonic and always truthful debate-without distortions, lies or misappropriations. Sarcasm hurts-but, this is what the polemic is all about.

I don't know the poet articles you speak of, so I don't know what might be different with them, but the rule as I understand it is that poetry should be quoted only as an integrated part of the article's discussion.

There was also another consideration, which I didn't mention in my edit reason because I thought perhaps it was too obvious: This is the English-language Wikipedia, and there is an expectation that English-language readers can read any article without missing something because it's in another language.

Kaiser's logo is relevant to anyone who wants to know about Kaiser, it seems Wikipedia considers the identity of the CEO of an organization relevant, and their website seems almost required - if someone, for instance, came to Wikipedia in order to find the website, they should be able to do so moderately easily; Kaiser's website should, in an article about Kaiser, stand out from all other links in some way.

Do you not think that it would be kind to respect Mendelssohn senior's wishe on this matter? He wished to abandon Judaism. Should he not be allowed to do so? Felix Mendelssohn was very ostensibly a Christian composer who wrote a great deal of church music, much of which is used liturgically today. If he was a convert, like Mahler, then it might be reasonable to categorise him as Jewish, in that he would have been Jewish for part of his life. However, he was not. He was baptised as a Christian having been born to Christian parents.

 sincere reply to Ninlil 
  Dear Ninhil, I thank you very much for intervening... at least this much is accepted by a neutral arbitrator that in case two authors differ in their versions, both versions must be allowed to be retained.  Since you wanted specific instances, in the book named Ancient India (1956) by K.A.N.Sastri, he has stated clearly while describing Rajendra Chola I that among the list of conquests (at one point he stated clearly thus:) 'next was the turn Satyasraya who was defeated and banished out of his capital'.  This can be contrasted with the statement in this Article that Satyasraya was able to control Chola aggression basing his contention on material from author Suryanath Kamath, without commenting on the accuracy of Suryanath Kamath's version, I accept your verdict that both versions should be allowed to be retained.  Dinesh is also erring badly when he writes subsequently in this article about Jayasimha also fighting hard with the Cholas (in fact Rajendra Chola ruled during the time of Satyasraya as well as Jayasimha and has claimed to defeat both) and also goes on to add that both sides lost and won but both K.A.N.Sastri and Rajendra's inscriptions at the Tanjore temple (courtesy the summary of Prof. Huntzsch, noted epigraphist appointed by the Archaelogical Survey of India, a body of the Ministry of Human Resource Development, Govt. of India, whose finds are given in detail at inscriptions.whatsindia.com/ - a site despised unnecessarily by Dinesh Kannambadi as a POV site because its findings go against 'historical events and their conclusions' of his liking) state that he emulated his father in winning the 'seven and a half lakshas of Rattapadi' and where Prof. Huntzsch has clearly arrived at the conclusion (after reading Chola inscriptions from the times of Raja Raja Chola because it was from his time onwards that there were several wars between the Cholas and Chalukyas) that winning seven and a half lakshas of Rattapadi meant winning the war and levying tribute on the losing Chalukya king.  Satyasraya lost twice, once to Raja Raja Chola when the Chola army was led by his son Rajendra and once to Rajendra, who also went on to defeat Satyasraya's successor Jayasimha II and Prof. Huntzsch once again attests the expression by Rajendra Chola I in the inscription at the Tanjore temple, a World Heritage site ': """"the seven and a half lakshas of Iratta-padi, (which was) strong by nature, (through the conquest of which) immeasurable fame arose,[7] (and which he took from) Jayasimha, who, out of fear (and) full of vengeance, turned his back at Muyangi and hid himself"""", as the Chola once again winning the war (this time it was over Vengi with the Chola army first routing the Chalukyas near Rajahmundry and subsequently at Masangi (called Muyangi in the Chola inscriptions in Tamil langauge), causing their king Jayasimha to banish and then levying tribute on the defeated Chalukya.' These have been attested by both K.A.N.Sastri and R.C.Roychowdhuri in their two books of the same name i.e. Ancient India.  

To repeat the above, the author R.C.Roychowdhuri in his book Ancient India borrows heavily by quoting extensively from K.A.N.Sastri - this unfortunately, goes against the thinking of user Kannambadi who is repeating blindly that I have no sources - I can assure you certainly I can read and write. It is very poor in taste, the expression of Dinesh Kannambadi who has gone on to justify my previous blocking, as is evident on my talk page dear Ninhil, this was done by user Blinguen an admin probably, who barged into my talk page and blocked me without giving any reason the second time i.e. he violated two rules of Wikipedia which are being advocated by Dinesh Kannambadi and another clique at work in wikipedia, first they ask people like us, who draw from sources and post at times historical events which are not palatable to them,  that we should first post on the discussion page, but in my case I was straight away blocked on the first occasion by user Blinguen who certainly did not discuss with me on the article discussion page nor did he discuss the topic itself with me.  The second time Blinguen entered my talk page, left a comment that he did not like what I wrote for he thought what I wrote was a personal commentary (when in actuality, it was a summary of Chola historty from which I drew from Prof. Huntzsch's summary from inscriptions.whatsindia.com/ but had made the mistake (I am not shy of admitting I make mistakes) of not posting the source, but before I realized and re-entered the Chola page, I found first that I was not able to edit and found to my horror that Blinguen has arrived at a certain conclusion and blocked me without giving me a chance to explain, discuss or argue with me on the concerned topic and its contents, just as Dinesh Kannambadi is trying to do now by painting anyone whose findings he doesn't like, in black.

 Turkic or Mongolian? An End to the Edit wars and extra details of Timur? 

Trigger Warning

I think there is some issue with some people when they call this man Mongolian or Turkic. The reason I'm writing this, I want to add extra information about the Barlas Tribe in which he is descendant from in this article in his Early Life. Timur is not of """"direct Chinggisid descent"""", he is Son-In-Law(kürgän)or Gurkani of the Chinggisd through his marriage, yet he is Mongolian. It is simple, one of his ancestors of the Barlas was named Qarachar Noyon who was """"head of corps"""" for the House of Chaghadai and by this became """"Chaghadai Khan’s chief administrator as well as chief judge of the yarghu, or court of investigation, through which Mongol law was enforced"""".

 Image question 

An image you uploaded back in October 2009 commons:File:Population density of Ireland map2002.svg to the commons does not provide a source of where the data actually came from. I am reviewing all the images in the Ireland article for a future GA nomination and wonder if you recall the source location. It says that it is """"Based upon Republic of Ireland - 2002 Census results"""" but finding the exact source is difficult and where did the Northern Ireland information came from. Cheers   
Republic: Central Statistics Office 
Northern: Office for National Statistics    

I don't mean to be a pedant but the Irish census of 2002 does not appear to have any population density statistics. Did I miss them or did you create them from the census and some land mass data? If you did that would that not be synthesis? The Northern Ireland stats do have density figures but these don't coincide with the county boundaries. Can you please explain some more? I would like to keep this image in the Ireland article but as we are trying to get it to GA and possibly FA, such matters as questioned sources tend to be an issue. Thanks in advance. I am watching this page for a while so there is no need to drop me a  note.   
Here is the original source, that I based the map on. . That in turn were supposed to be based on the above two. I assumed it was right and never checked though. In hindsight I probably should have checked. Feel free to remove or change the map.     

Brilliant. I will dig deeper with the source you provided as I like the image and would like to keep it in the article. Thanks again. Cheers

 History of citizenship in the United States 

Unfortunately Tomwsulcer has decided to leave the project. FYI please see User talk:Tomwsulcer#Terrorism prevention strategies moved to user space. I had problems with this article, largely because Tomwsulcer was inexperienced and did not write in a NPOV style and had real problems with being unaware of a systemic bias in his writing. The article I moved was well over 150k, so all in all I could see no other quick solution. (See User talk:Tomwsulcer/Terrorism prevention strategies for my conversation on the article with Tomwsulcer)

Because more people have contributed to the article History of citizenship in the United States you might like to open up a discussion on its talk page of what to do with the article now that the principle author has left leaving so many problems behind. I would have thought that the subject is notable and drastic pruning may allow the article to remain. However if the consensus solution needs an administrator to carry out an action let me know.

"Support for now. It could be the first step towards solving the problem - the box now looks right. The remainder of the problem is to do with semantic markup (i.e. semantic wiki markup, not particularly semantic HTML). I believe that there are several projects to do with the semantic web that use Wikipedia info boxes to obtain categorised data about the article subjects. Semantically, what we now state is that there are seven entries under past_members, two of whom are 'Principal line–up' and 'Other members' Messrs line-up and members will appear to semantic data harvesting software to have been past members of The Beatles. There is a world of difference between putting text into bold type and labelling text with a meaningful heading. Therefore the discussion should continue at Template talk:Infobox musical artist until the fields and labels of the info box are altered to be in line with this proposal. If this solution is carried forward and implemented, and the info box is never updated, then this will be just an ugly hack that actually reduces the usefulness of info boxes in particular and Wikipedia in general.",0.0

Israeli """"Apartheid"""" Article
How dare you identify a very clear and reasonable allegation of bias as """"vandalism"""". I'm disgusted with your behaviour, and your willingness to suppress arguments that don't mesh with your ideological foundation. Considering that the page I edited deals with human rights, I find it very salient that you are more than willing to suppress the freedom of expression by turning this site into a dictatorship of the obsessive over the intelligent.

Thanks?=
I am an African American currently residing outside of the States.  I just wanted to write and say """"Thanks DeeCee"""", for your work over at the Black Supremacist page.  I surfed there by accident.  I was shocked to find that Wikipedia has even chosen to include this article.  It is far too long in view of the insignificance of so-called """"Black Supremacy"""" when compared to the massive White Supremacist Movement which is once again taking the entire White World by storm.  (Are you a Black Supremacist, if you are only trying to survive in a nation that overtly practices and tolerates Racist practices such a lynching or segregation?)  Until I read our courageous comments, I was truly daunted by the sheer malevolence that appears to be at work in that article, especially the insidious denigrations of Marcus Garvey.  So many considered him to be a hero for addressing Black suffering in the Post Slavery Occident.  Yet, that article slanders him viciously, referring to him as an errand boy of the Klu Klux Klan and a friend of White Supremacists.  I have not been able to find any truth in any of these statements, so I deleted them.  So much of the material there appears to be merely conjectured or anecdotal designed to tell ugly tales about African people in general rather than focus on the purported subject at hand.  Yet, on the White Supremacist page, there are no such juicy tidbits to further incite anger and outrage.  There are no tales told period, just the bare bones concerning this virulent hate-inspired movement.  In fact, much has been left out.  The White Supremacist article could have included a number of recent and not so reccent events that would have turned any reader's stomach but the writer keeps it very cut and dry.  Not so on the Black Supremaciy page where, the author goes out of his way to assasinate the character of any Black person who remotely expresses any racial pride or hope for his people.  I guess, he is just two fingers from calling Martin Luther King a Black Supremacist, since he incited Black people to protest white brutality and segregation.

I want to complain to Wikipedia about the unhealthy tone in which the Black Supremacist page has been written.  The assaults on Rappers and other musicians such as Lauren Hill is shocking.  I have no doubt that the article is motived by racial hate.  It is so apt that you have identified the problems as systemic.  Wikipedia is a true menace in the sense that people of African descent are often assaulted but may lack the resources, time or orientations necessary to defend themselves against those who use Wikipedia to commit what amounts to racial assault.  Refutations are highly resented and a general ambiance of White supremacist aggression reigns on many pages.  I haven't read all that you've written, I imagine that you spend a lot of time, fighting the good fight.  Again thanks.  I hope you get this message.Sincerely
Vani

I don't have any problem with the NPOV rule.  I just see censorship over and over. Wikipedia is clear:

""""None of this, however, is to say that minority views cannot receive as much attention as we can possibly give them on pages specifically devoted to those views. There is no size limit to Wikipedia. But even on such pages, though a view is spelled out possibly in great detail, we still make sure that the view is not represented as the truth."""" 

Now I have wanted to have cooperation and have good faith efforts on both sides.  I have listened to the other side and taken feedback. I made some changes although admittedly not a lot.  

However, Cooperation may never happen.  Why?

Here is why:

1.  Does MickWest change the theological conservative Christianity  internal link so it goes to the Christian right (Falwell, etc).  Would a person who wants to act in good faith do that?  

2. Would people who act in good faith send harrassing messages (""""fundie"""" etc).  

I think the people calling for cooperation yet saying absolutely nothing publically about the bad behavior of certain parties are not seeking true cooperation.  What they are asking for is the minority view be trampled despite the Wikipedia policy.

 Complex issue 

 This is quite a complex issue. There have been a few cases around the world where individual officials have solemnised marriages (e.g. France, Greece, Quintana Roo in Mexico). I don't think these jurisdictions should be included in the template, since there is no generalised recognition of same-sex marriage or possibility of generally entering into a legal same-sex marriage. However, what we have in Alagoas seems a bit different. I am prima facie in favour of including Alagoas based on the reasoning of User:Denisxavier. However, before we include Alagoas, we need a bit more information about how Brazilian marriage law works. In particular, I have two questions:

 *When an opposite-sex couple wants to enter into a marriage in Brazil, how do they do it? Are legal marriages registered at a Civil Registry Office, which conducts a civil ceremony and provides the marriage certificate? What is the role of the judge in these marriages? Also, what is a """"Notary""""? Are they a state official working in a Civil Registry Office, or a private person who can register marriages? The issue I am interested in here is: is the process for entering into a same-sex marriage identical to entering into an opposite-sex marriage in Alagoas? Or are there administrative / procedural differences?
 *Are Civil Registry Offices/Notaries obliged to register same-sex marriages in Alagoas, or are they merely allowed to do so? If they are not obliged to do so, then I think it's more problematic to include Alagoas in the template, because it means that the law is not being applied consistently.

 The fact that the highest federal court has not yet ruled on the matter is in my opinion irrelevant. When the Supreme Court of California legalised same-sex marriage in California, we still included it in the template, even if the Supreme Court of the US did not yet give its opinion. Wikipedia is flexible enough that it can accommodate to changing realities; if a superior court strikes down the lower court, then all we need to do is simply change the template again. This has been done a few times already. Cheers, '''''' ✉ """,0.0

I like the INTERVENTION, I dont like used to aid, as this implies 100% effectiveness??

I say to you not to worry because everything you say against me or my contributions means absolutely nothing for me and sadly my oppinion of you just dropped to a level even lower than hell.

They also redirected new articles as  Bulgarian minority in Greece to Minorities of Greece, Bulgarians in Greece to Minorities in Greece and Tarlis incident  to Treaty of Sevres without warning and discussion.

Binksternet
Hello Enric, I just had a very brief discussion with  which went as follows:

Me:   """"Binksternet, User:Kitsunedawn has inserted a new section into Amelia Earhart which is redundant to the paragraph on Gardner Island. The new section also seems to have a bit of a WP:POV issue. I’d rectify the situation myself, but the page is protected. I understand you have some history with the article so I thought you might want to know about it.""""

Binksternet:   """"The added material is far too promotional for TIGHAR. I would like to ask why you, the IP editor from Northern Mississippi, did not remove the text yourself. It is plainly counter to the nominal purpose of putting forward the best available information about Earhart. Nevertheless, I am happy to do so despite the fact that you did not do so.""""

After I finished laughing I started to write a reply, but I realized that if Binksternet could not be bothered to read as far as the third sentence of my first post then there was no reason to think that he would actually read my reply.  I also think that his mention of my geographic location is purposeless.  I am well aware of my own location.

This is not the first time that Binksternet has started shit with me.  Back in November I had this thoroughly unpleasant conversation with Binksternet when I tried to correct a problem with Grey School of Wizardry.

Binksternet indicates (in a picture) on his talk page that he thinks that registration should be required.  And while he is entitled to his own opinion, he isn’t entitled to cast utterly baseless aspersions of impropriety at IP editors.

The last time I wanted to fix a problem with the Earhart article I asked Dougweller to do it, and he was agreeable.  I see now that I should have brought this recent problem to the attention of an administrator, but I had thought it would be helpful to alert Binksternet to the issue because he has a history with the article and would be more likely to keep an eye on the situation than an admin who doesn’t normally edit the article.

Would you please explain to Binksternet that:

1.  I can’t edit the article because it is protected and I have already explained that in my first post.

2.  It isn’t civil to baselessly accuse IP editors of wrongdoing when they are trying to improve Wikipedia and operating in good-faith.

3.  IP editors are allowed to edit Wikipedia.

I reject this notion

The article claims """"The defeat was attributed to massive vote splitting with the Greens, which in many cases allowed the Liberals to sneak up the middle and win""""  This claim is nonsensical when compared to the fact that the Liberals won 57% of the popular vote province wide.  Even if the remaining 43% had all voted for one party, the Liberals would have likely won anyways.  I personally went through the article and added all the vote totals for the NDP and Green candidates. (exlcuding the richmond and delta ridings because there was no totals)   I could only find 7 cases where, had ALL the voters for the Greens AND ndp voted for the same party, they would have defeated the Liberals.   If this had been the case the Liberals STILL would have had 65 of 72 (the legilature minus richmond and delta) seats versus only 9 for the NDP.  The NDP would still have lost 76.92% of their total seats in the legislature.  

So as a consequence I'm removing that sentence.

  

Well I agree that vote splitting played a role, to attribute the NDP's defeat to this is ludicrous.""",0.0

Consider the background to Mtking and Newmanoconnor immediately agreeing to your no-AfD proposal. Just a week ago they wouldn't have even given you the time of day. The current situation has them very scared and they'll pretty much do anything do anything to fast-track their terrible plan through. This is why they're talking 1-2 week timelines whereas before they've been been screwing with the MMA community for months with an incomplete doc while AfD'ing everything in sight. Of course, short-tracking necessarily means they'll railroad the MMA voices against. If they don't get the short-track, their plan is essentially dead, which is why they'll show a tiny bit of leeway in the short term to get what they want in the long term. What's most notable is that even if they get what they want, it doesn't mean they don't AfD again right after they get approval. Their plan has no brightline rules, and it's vague and open to interpretation (which is why AfD are effective now). The situation after will be no better, but we'll be stuck with it while they're not saddled with anything.

Feller says that unimodal distribution is a distribution function that is convex up to the mode and concave beyond it.

Therefore I suggest a more general definition of a unimodal function: a function whose local maxima make up an interval.

Moreover, it might be worth replacing '(this allows for the possibility of a non-zero probability for x=m)' with '(in this case the distribution may have density everywhere except, possibly, m; this allows for the possibility of a non-zero probability for x=m)'",0.0

Hiya, Zachary. I just made an edit to the Holy Crap article, changing the voice of Francis Griffin from Charles Durning to Colm Meaney based on source such as TV Guide. However, I see that you made a previous edit in which you stated that Meaney was not in the episode. If this is true, then please revert my changes (if someone doesn't beat you to them). However, if possible (and if you haven't done so already), could you please check the end credits of the episode to make sure that Meaney was not a voice actor in the episode? If he wasn't, then I think what we have here is a severe case of misinformation from many sources – apparently Meaney was originally cast for the role and may have actually done some of the voice work but was ultimately replaced with Charles Dunring, who had to re-do the dialogue.

 Going commando 

Why are you removing my edit from the Going commando post ? 

I do think of it as useful, since it is one of the most well-known examples of someone who was going commando. Grtz. 

I understand you wish to discourage edits that are purely between British and American spelling, but in British usage """"practise"""" is a verb and """"practice"""" is a noun.  I think this may be a useful distinction.   

 My RfA

I intend to work on addressing the concerns that were raised, and think I need to work contributing without allowing myself to become as stressed as I have been at times, which did result in some inappropriate behavior. Perhaps I may re-explore adminship at some point in the future, but it's a little early to consider that. Again, thank you.

 Strength training 

Hi,

You removed a bunch of text from the strength training article (the 'common concerns' section).  I reverted your edit, and this is to let you know why.  You said in your edit summary """"deleting copyvio from http://www.tranquillizer.co.uk/weight-training-concerns.html"""" - if you look at that page, you can see at the end of some statements, there are numbers thus """"[17]"""".  The tranquillizer site actually copied the information from wikipedia, not the other way around.  Its not a copyvio from us, it's a copy vio from them.  Just a head's up.

 

Sounds like you think the section's biggest problem is the tone of the section rather than the section itself.  I'd agree with that, I'll try for a re-write if I have time in the near future.

There had been a lot of revert warring, beginning with Jayjg's revert of 24.136.98.130's edit, over the very point that 72.244.64.149 was making; 72.244.64.149 seems appropriately to have brought the dispute to the talk page and, having received no response to his concerns, placed the POV tag rather than joining the revert warring. You wrote that a POV tag placement is """"normally only done if no agreement on the neutrality of the article can be reached on the talk page""""  isn't this exactly the situation in which 72.244.64.149 placed the tag?
I think you owe 72.244.64.149 another apology for saying that he/she """"accused"""" you of defending the content. It would be more accurate to say that 72.244.64.149 fairly mildly disagreed with your impromptu denial of an accusation that was never made.

"Looking for your reply 

Hi! I removed your edit to Cooperative because it violates the principles in WP:NOT, particularly: Wikipedia is not a publisher of original thought and Wikipedia is not a soapbox. There is some useful information in what you posted, some of which wasn't really covered in the article, but it would be much better for you to look through the section you edited, and see where individual points you wrote about would best go. Please also remember Wikipedia strives for a neutral point of view; your beliefs about what a cooperative is or is not may not be shared by everyone who has experience with cooperatives. Your edits should not state an opinion not shared by all as a fact. Argyriou 

To Argyriou,
I have noticed your action regarding my contribution.

Let me add few comments:
- English is not my primary language, so it is possible that a meaning very clear to me sounds or understood differently to an English speaking born. 

- A page about cooperative should contain, IMHO, a complete information about cooperatives and cooperative movement worldwide. The page now is limited to the official ICA approach, which is not the only one. I may say that this approach prove to be a failure in many parts of the world.

- I have tried to present a another approach to cooperative, and an approach developed in Israel during tenth of years. I can't see a reason why this approach shouldn't be presented on the Wikipedia.
More than this: there are cooperatives in the world who have followed in one way or another this approach. More information can be found: http://www.coopgalor.com/realization.html
A very successful example in the U.S.A can be read here: http://www.coopgalor.com/realization/Oklahoma.html

- This approach is backed by papers published in different places, including ICA. These papers can be read at: http://www.coopgalor.com/i_publications.html#Whats_coop
I hope a reconsideration of your decision would be possible and that my text would find its place on the Wikipedia.

 FC Bayern edits 

I removed Julian Green, Fabian Benko, Gianluca Gaudino and Ivan Lucic as they don't play for FC Bayern.  They play for FC Bayern II.  While they are on pro contracts, they are not part of the team.  They have been """"loanded"""" to FC Bayern II until further notice.  I noted this back when I added footnote 148 about the trio being demoted.  While they are permitted to be recalled, they are assigned to FC Bayern II.  That is where they show up on Wiki, rightfully so.  While on a pro contract, they are assigned to FC Bayern II and that is where they should remain.  This would be the same as showing Hojbjerg as part of FC Bayern.  Technically, he is part of the squad, but on loan to Schalke.  He is different in that he can't be recalled at moment's notice.  But the similarities is that he's assigned to Schalked, just like Green, Lucic, Benko and Gaudino are assigned to FCB II.

 OneGuy's vanadalism of the discussion page 
Aside from OneGuy deleting other user's comments, he has now begun to blatently disorganize and effectively vanadalize people's comments: he distrupting the flow of users' comments by arbitrarily cutting off paragraphs and inserting his comments in between, instead of being civil and adding his reply to the end of a given post. Combined with his ceasless personal attacks, false accusations, and insistance on making wikipedia a propoganda machine for Islamist apologetics of the blackest kind, his behaviour has become completely intolerable, and I do not see any point in constantly refuting the same false accusations and false assertions over and over again. OneGuy must be ejected from this discussion before it can have any hope of being a civiled and productive debate. I am left with no choice but to completely resign from this discussion, since it seems that no one is going to be moderating OneGuy's behaviour anytime soon.  Pename

What's ironic is that OneGuy claims he is not a muslim and therefore can not be considered an Islamic apologist!  In fact, most of the Muhammad/Islam apologists here claim to not be Muslim!  Looks like Muhammad's best friends are the infidels.  

As of moderating OneGuy's behavior, the Arbitrators are looking into him and myself after he filed a hypocritical arbitration request against me and I thus filed a countercomplaint against OneGuy.  Whenever OneGuy spots someone who doesn't agree with his radical apologistic viewpoint he tries to silence them by any means at his disposal.  OneGuy, in his complaint in arbitration, accused me of rivert(sic) wars and having POV in my contributions yet he does the exact same thing, only more so.  In the arbitration complaint, the arbitrators don't seem as concerned about the POV contributions as they do about personal attacks, revert wars and my vandalism of his user page. See Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/168.209.97.34.  When OneGuy was giving evidence against me he incorrectly called a few minor word changes as a revert war (even though the change were only made once or twice) and he clearly left out the revert wars in which he was involved (but the arbitrators were not fooled - they found him out).

Since the arbitrators will probably not do anything about his radical apologistic contributions, they will most likely respond to his vandalism of the talk pages.  Feel free to post your complaints regarding OneGuy on Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/168.209.97.34/Evidence.    06:56, 9 Dec 2004 (UTC)

 Since when replying on talk page has become vandalism? Only one time I deleted Pename comments when he cut and pasted his comments that were already on the page on top of my response in a new section that I created (""""death to critics""""). Pename has ignored what we are discussing and is resorting to personal insults and false accusations (in violation of wiki policy) that I vandalized the talk page. He now claims that he did not copy the verse from anti-Islamic site. If true, where did he find the interpretation that 8:67 means kill prisoners of war? He implied that interpretation in the article. At worst, the verse condemns the behavior of taking prisoners in order to make money, but he has not given his source that says 8:67 means kill prisoners. Instead of answering where he found that interpretation (if not anti-Islamic site), Pename is resorting to personal insults and outright lies that I vandalized the talk page  18:46, 6 Dec 2004 (UTC)

 Sourcing 

I must admit I'm more than a little concerned about the sourcing for this article:
A fifty-year old German-language journal article is more than a tad inaccessible, making it problematical as a general reference  as even if you could get your hands on it, a non-fluent-German reader would have difficulty browsing it to see where it says what.
I don't think an Biblically-inerrant Christian apologetics article, with a fairly partisan tone is a WP:RS for what should be an anthropological article.

If I'm not mistaken, It sounds like you are telling me to piss off and go edit somewhere else. I certainly do not want to sound uncivil but don't be a Bully or a dick.

I have not used or added or any sources to the main entry that were not already there or that you did not restore yourself! If you say a source I used on this entry affects my credibility then you show be. Which source specifically are you referring to?

It would take a real simpleton to believe the current conspiracy but you'd be much worse off mentally if you still believed that our government plus Canada, UK, and Australia hasn't ever worked together on a series of covert projects designed to spread biological agents over a large scale (across continents) from airplanes. I hope that's not the case here.  Go ahead and call that what I just described a conspiracy. I dare you- in fact I double-dog-dare you! It is declassified and admitted and on a participating government website. I'll assume good faith, perhaps it is ignorance of the subject on your parts. It ok, I'm ignorant of a lot of wikipedia editing stuff. Belief in documented past history is the not the same as a belief in some conspiracy theory crap. Based on you comments about me, this is a concept you appear to be having trouble with. Any competent person would understand they are not the same. Is there was one available to you to explain it? I was explained to you repeatedly on this page and on my talk page. You are pretty dense of you don't have it yet.  You will find that my primary sources are 100 times more accurate than anything you'll ever find on about this fringe topic.  I am a subject matter expert on certain aspects of CBW and exposures but not on chem trails but no about to out myself to convince you.  Government declassified primary sources on WP are to be used sparingly. People like you make it difficult to talk about serious subjects. Reasonable people should not be constrained in their edits by pure ignorance unless ignorance is the consensus (TBD).  You are unable to consider ever it which speaks to your credibility.

"Incorrect Abbreviations Vandalism Warning 

 Bender176, kindly do not delete my message without first replying or updating the Abbreviations page. ***

Bender176, I am on a shared IP address. This is the first time I've edited any Wikipedia page. I am referring to the Abbreviations page (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbreviation#United_States). The section regarding Dr. Gale Stephens and Lana Verkuil is obviously vandalism itself. I removed it and restored the original section to what it had been pre-vandalism. Please either advise me why you marked my action as vandalism, or restore the page to its pre-vandalism form. Thank you.

PS - I probably should add that I am not the above individual you have been attempting to prevent from vandalizing Wikipedia. This IP is at a college, so there are many students, faculty, etc all under the same IP address.

PPS - I notice you can add custom text explaining why a change was made. How do you access that option?

PPPS - I would appreciate it if you quit deleting this.  It is quite frustrating.  I am attempting to help Wikipedia fight vandalism and you're preventing that.",0.0

"""Kurt and Dave get it on?==

Groaning Kurt released his cock. For the past week he hadn't been able to get off. He tried a cocktail of drugs and a cocktail of whores. Nothing was doing it for him. Masturbating in the shower wasn't even working. Oh he was getting hard all right, he just couldn't fucking cum. And it was driving him nuts.

To top it off, he didn't know why he couldn't cum. The girls had been either hot enough or slutty enough. Even the couple of guys he brought home had been decent. Despite that, he couldn't fucking cum. And a week of that was enough to make anyone more pissy than normal.

Which meant band practice was unlikely to be much fun for anyone.

That was made abundantly clear the moment Kurt stepped into the rehearsal studio. His eyes flicked from Krist to Dave and he came to a sudden stop. Dave was sitting on a couch, a pretty girl in his lap giggling. It was like he was taunting Kurt. And he would have nothing of that.

Stalking over to the drummer and the floozie, Kurt pulled her forcibly out of his lap. The girl squealed and Dave growled, but Kurt paid no attention, forcing the girl out of the studio. After slamming the door he headed back over to Dave. Without a word he pulled the drummer to him and kissed him possessively.

Dave shoved Kurt away, """"What part of no don't you fucking understand!?""""

Krist's eyes widened and he took a step forward, """"Guys, I think—""""

Kurt sent him a silent glare, silencing and stopping him.

""""I don't want you, Kurt. I don't even fucking like you right now,"""" Dave growled. """"In fact, I fucking quit! I don't have to put up with this shit. You're fucking insane. You need some other crackwhore to take my place. I'm not it.""""

Sidestepping the singer, Dave headed towards the door. He barely made three steps before Kurt grabbed him again. This time his back was pulled to Kurt's front. He could clearly feel the singer's erection pressing into his ass.

He wasn't going to be anyone's bitch.

""""I'm just gonna... go,"""" Krist muttered before slipping out of the room quickly.

""""You're fucking mine, Dave,"""" Kurt declared, licking Dave's neck. """"Always.""""

For as small as he was, Kurt had more strength than Dave expected. With considerably less effort than he would have figured, the singer forced the drummer down to the floor. Dave wiggled and tried to crawl away, but all that resulted was in Kurt pulling the drummer's pants off.

Laying down on top of Dave while he worked his own pants off, Kurt hissed in his ear, """"You're mine. You hear me? Fucking mine.""""

""""Stop! Kurt, stop!"""" Dave struggled.

With Kurt's weight on him, the drummer had very little maneuverability. He was completely trapped. But that didn't mean he stopped trying to get away. While wholly his struggling was probably a good thing, it wasn't really helping. If anything it was turning Kurt on more.

Not having the patience to remove Dave's boxers, Kurt reached down and tore the back seam, exposing the drummer's ass. He didn't even pause to warn Dave. His hands spread Dave's cheeks, spit down his crack to provide some lubrication, and quickly pushed his cock in. Dave screamed, wiggling once more to get away. With Kurt's hands holding onto his hips, he had no chance to go anywhere, at least not until the singer was done.

Dave's screams faded into sobs. That alone drove Kurt further, faster. He loved everything about it. The way Dave's ass squeezed his cock better than anyone else's had before. He was a perfect glove, a perfect fit. Before too long a week's worth of unreleased cum spurted from Kurt's cock.

Slowly he pulled out, not really caring about the mixture of blood and semen leaking from Dave's ass. Grinning to himself he refastened his pants. He glanced at Dave, a feeling of superiority infusing him. He totally owned Dave now. 

Does anyone have any basis for this rumour? I would love to put it on the main page.

"""user and talk pages, and their subpages, and other non-article pages that *no others have substantively contributed to* and whose existence does *not impact the project*, *may* be courtesy blanked or deleted.""""'' But, with users who have been substantial contributors that doesn't seem to apply as 1) others HAVE substantially contributed to the pages 2) it may well have impact on the project. The only justification for this deletion would be IAR in exceptional circumstances of real-life privacy violation or harassment. If it isn't that, then there is utterly no basis in policy or consensus. The discussion on AN, which I link above, bears that out. Courtesy blanking is better in such cases. g 

It's only four talk pages. There's absolutely no need for crazy statements like """"Your deletion is improper"""". We can get to the bottom of why the Mercury left and why he requested deletion, and deal with undeletion and courtesy blanking as soon as we know the full reasons behind the request.   

I've tried to contact Mercury, but for the moment, I've undeleted the pages, courtesy blanked them and protected them from further edits. I can't see anything which would cause any problems for Mercury, but if he does request their full deletion again and cites privacy concerns, I'll look favorably on such a request.   

(ec)Sorry, I probably over reacted. I'm fighting a larger war on routine deletions of talk pages and archives - and a general misunderstanding of the rtv, and what it allows. I believe that the deletion of usertalk pages of established users is only justified in exceptional circumstances of causing off-wiki difficulties (and, in such cases, IAR can be validly invoked.) If you are satisfied that, in this case, there are such circumstances, then I won't question your judgement or ask for details. However, you might perhaps consider whether selective deletion/oversight of offending posts, or courtesy deletion might be better. Having said that, I leave it with you - I'll say no more and I'll not contest whatever you finally decide. I'm going to take up the wider issue as a policy discussion (without naming you or this particular case). I've posted, in generalities, to the mailing list. Again sorry for my tone.g

 Yeah, feel free. There's some deleted edits to the article which should be fairly self explanatory regarding the need to delete the article and create a new article, but it looks like the editor responsible has simply given up.

Thank you for your support in my RfA. It was definitely a dramatic debate! I paid close attention to everything that was said, and, where possible, I will try to incorporate the (constructive) criticism towards being a better administrator. I'm taking things slowly for now, partially because it's the holiday season and there are plenty of off-wiki distractions. ) I'm also working my way through the Wikipedia:New admin school and double-checking the relevant policies, and will gradually phase into the use of the new tools. My main goals are to help out with various backlogs, but I also fully intend to keep on writing articles, as there are several more that I definitely want to get to WP:FA status! Thanks again, onka

I have given ample time almost one and half year for providing reliable sources, but it was not the case, Mr Kumarrao always considers a Caste book as authenic History book p.
again a week back gave proper sources to clarify that its false claim.
I have clarified the author that non english sources are not reliable.

Good afternoon DreamGuy. I would like to reply to the message you left me since I could not do so privately in e-mail. Please feel free to delete this whenever you are through with it. I rather think posting those links in commercial and personal spaces are acceptable and based on the rules of Wikipedia are not out of line. If posting them on all sub-links of Savannah as points of interest is wrong, I am sorry, but it seemed pertinent to me, especially since there is hardly any other information on those pages. I did not “spam” (as you say) any links on pages that were not somehow directly related to the subject of the links. Why you chose to pick those two links, out of many commercial and non-commercial links on the pages to dispute, I have no idea. I am sorry if you have a problem with ghost books but this one is directly related to Savannah, Georgia so it seems to me that this link would be the last one you would erase off the Savannah page. Having reviewed the “spamming” page link it seems to me that spamming would be on a much larger scale that the links I posted. If you would like I can move all of them to the bottom, if this appeases your mind. I also linked them in the external links section, this is not like I cut into every paragraph of the articles and inserted the link. I actually thought it might be of interest to people who happen to enjoy ghosts. I am not even in the employ of Cobblestone Tours or even James Caskey himself, I just thought (as a local Savannah resident who has read the book, taken the tour, and is a fan) that I should point more people who are interested in this sort of thing to the stories and experience. However, feel free to remove links that are not pertinent, if you so choose, but articles related directly to Savannah’s ghosts, I feel, are not in that category.  In the future though, if you would like to continue this discussion, feel free to send me an e-mail, this information should be available to you as I filled it out when I registered.",0.0

I've restored the page to the version that's stood for some months. To address the anon's concerns:
 The revert restoring the """"Criticisms of Prime Ministerial Power"""" section repeated, nearly word for word, information already in """"Role and authority"""".
 The revert restoring the """"List of Canadian Prime Ministers"""" section created a whole section for one link that duplicated one at the top of the """"Qualifications and selection"""" section.
 The revert restoring the """"Salary"""" and """"Privileges"""" sections split an earlier merge of the two, for no apparent benefit. It also reinstated trivial and unsourced comparisons of the Prime Minister's salary to """"some of Canada's top corporate executives"""" (note weasel words).
 The revert restoring the """"Living former Prime Ministers"""" reinstated trivial information better covered at List of Prime Ministers of Canada
 The revert restoring the """"Death of the Prime Minister"""" reinstated a list of trivia and moved back there information that had been shifted to the """"Privileges"""" section.

I find it amazing how you can write so much, and yet, say so little. That massive essay above is just the same stuff you've been saying for ages and everyone here has already rejected it (Apart from about the document Kolzene presented, I agree that that can certainly be used for the article). Again you're going on about this Urbanates thing, you said we should replace the Urbanates section with some undefined notion of """"Urban Planning"""", but you don't seem to get the fact that Urban Planning and Urbanates are exactly the same thing in Technocracy. A Technate wouldn't go on building old style cites, it would be build Urbanates, therefore any Urban Planning will be the planning of Urbanates. You say """"I would suggest Hibernian that you or someone make a file of the Wilton Ivey piece, and use that in reference to Urban Planning."""", but that is essentially what is already there, the Urbanates article was mostly written in reference to the ideas Wilton Ivey, etc. If you want a longer section about what a Technate might do with cities before it replaces them with Urbanates (which would likely take decades to build), then be my guest if you know some specifics about it. However, so far you have added absolutely nothing to that section, you have only deleted material from it, so I'm not very optimistic about what you could contribute (especially taking into account your incredibly biased opinions on the issue).

no referrences to  Obstruction of justice huh? 
The article should clearly mention the great effort the Bush administration made of hiding all the evidence. This was the main embodyment of the attack. Obstruction of justice of this scale is a far bigger crime as murder.

FOLLOW THE MONEY!
The page should mention Lary Silverstein owned the building for a day and a half and maxed out the insurance for multiple terrorist attacks. Thus he cashed in multiple times.

"Khalatnikov 

JETP isn't scanned yet, so Khalatnikov's contribution, which seem to be closer to Candlin than Salam and Matthews (Feynman also does something similar to Salam and Matthews in one of the electrodynamics papers, but without the Fermionic coherent states, and without the justification in terms of sum over intermediate states, which are both found in Candlin for the first time, I think.) This paper talks about the result: the integral over Fermionic fields is defined following Schwinger so that the action principle will work, and the result is that the determinant is in the numerator and not the denominator. This is most of Grassman integration, but without the formal anticommuting variables, which seem to have been introduced by Berezin and Candlin independently (at least according to this source). I did not read the original Berezin articles, only the 1965 textbook, so perhaps they are more complete than I originally thought. If anyone has read these, please include a summary of the contents. The real question, in my mind, is as follows:

 Feynman's propagator approach only requires that the statistics be correct when permuting the ends of the paths. The rest can be done by summing over particle paths, with appropriate projections to deal with Dirac eqn. So the early authors, between 1948-1954 are all dealing with formal anticommuting variables (no complete theory). This is true of the Schwinger action principle, and to a lesser extent, of Matthews and Salam.
 Matthews and Salam, like Feynman in his QEDIII paper, treat the sum over histories as green's function manipulations, without trying to formally define a calculus of anticommuting fields. They do define anticommuting sources, and anticommuting field Green's functions, but this is similar to Feynman and Schwinger. It does not have the crucial addition that the algebra of the fields in space-time makes sense, and the Fermi field integral is a sum over intermediate states.
 Khalatnikov seems to have understood the modern thing: that the Fermionic integral is a concept that is well defined. Unfortunately, I cannot access his paper. If anyone has access, please find out what is in there.
 Candlin defines the whole thing, in a very modern way. This paper is the best on the subject I have read, but it is similar to Berezin 1964.
 Berezin has some papers in the 1950s and 1960s, which seem to develop the whole thing indepedently, starting with Khalatnikov's observation. These papers are also crucial- who develops the Fermionic coherent states? And who shows that the Fermionic integral reproduces the sum over intermediate Fermionic states?

The whole thing is somewhat implicit in Matthews and Salam, but also in Schwinger and Feynman. The real important development is the identification of sum-over-intermediate states with grassmann integral. If someone can point out who did what, it would help a lot.",0.0

I have to agree with Alecmonroy: A > B is no different than B > A.

The immediately afterwards mention responses to those criticisms.    Then go onto the next, and so on.  What seems most important to me is how neutrally the prose goes from one to the next.  If it's something as simple as """"A says x, but B say y.""""  Then that's still set 'em up and knock 'em down. Also, using this format, it almost requires a bit extra emphasis given to explaining the criticisms in comparison to the rebuttals.

I am sick to death of your continual WP:SOAPboxing on this talkpage and will simply delete or revert (rather than archiving  as you simply remove the archive templates) any further irrelevant material. ''TalkStalk''(P) 

I hold a PhD in statistics, what is your degree? 
I've been published in two scientific journals (working on more), have you?
I've asked you on your site to at least allow time respond to the rule violations I have been accused of before you archive. Is this unreasonable?
You are saying you are going to simply delete discussion.  Is this not the same vandalism?

Here is the statement on WP:SOAP
Wikipedia is not a soapbox, a battleground, or a vehicle for propaganda and advertising. This applies to articles, categories, templates, talk page discussions, and user pages. Therefore, content hosted in Wikipedia is not:

Propaganda, advocacy, or recruitment of any kind, commercial, political, religious, or otherwise. Of course, an article can report objectively about such things, as long as an attempt is made to describe the topic from a neutral point of view. You might wish to start a blog or visit a forum if you want to convince people of the merits of your favorite views.[1] 

Opinion pieces. Although some topics, particularly those concerning current affairs and politics, may stir passions and tempt people to """"climb soapboxes"""" (i.e. passionately advocate their pet point of view), Wikipedia is not the medium for this. Articles must be balanced to put entries, especially for current events, in a reasonable perspective, and represent a neutral point of view. Furthermore, Wikipedia authors should strive to write articles that will not quickly become obsolete. However, Wikipedia's sister project Wikinews allows commentaries on its articles. 

Scandal mongering or gossip. Articles about living people are required to meet an especially high standard, as they may otherwise be libellous or infringe the subjects' right to privacy. Articles should not be written purely to attack the reputation of another person. 

Self-promotion. It can be tempting to write about yourself or projects in which you have a strong personal involvement. However, do remember that the standards for encyclopedic articles apply to such pages just like any other, including the requirement to maintain a neutral point of view, which is difficult when writing about yourself or about projects close to you. Creating overly abundant links and references to autobiographical articles is unacceptable. See Wikipedia:Autobiography, Wikipedia:Notability and Wikipedia:Conflict of interest. 
Advertising. Articles about companies and products are written in an objective and unbiased style. Article topics must be third-party verifiable, so articles about very small """"garage"""" or local companies are typically unacceptable. External links to commercial organizations are acceptable if they identify major organizations associated with a topic (see finishing school for an example). Wikipedia neither endorses organizations nor runs affiliate programs. See also Wikipedia:Notability (organizations and companies) for guidelines on corporate notability. Those promoting causes or events, or issuing public service announcements, even if noncommercial, should use a forum other than Wikipedia to do so. 

Clearly I have not tried to recruit, sell, gossip or self-promote.  The opinion peices are clearly talking about article and not discussion pages and are stated as such. The opinion I have stated are backed up with facts and hence on the discussion page.  Please enlighten me with what definiton of WP:SOAP you are using.  You are deleting with cause, harassing with provocation, and stating opinion with out any basis in facts.""",0.0

As soon as you accept that plug-in, that’s advertising, with no verifiable “trusted sourse”.

Surviving in Frankenwiki
Okay, I'm back from my latest 24-hour persecution, and I realize how the mediation request merely subjected the article to more """"Thought police"""" rather than encouraging civilized solutions to problems.  My mind is spinning in 100 directions. I really dread any continued judgment by a """"jury of sneers"""" so I doubt I would participate in any forums of that type. Some articles become hopeless chaos, when the masses descend and start hacking with no concept of the topic (""""Harry Potter what?""""). One of the worst hatchet jobs, to any article, was with """"Search engine"""" where the technical details conflicted with the general concept of searching for """"stuff"""" and people kept deleting those excessive technical parts about ranking pages (not unlike avoiding text about Low copy number DNA, fingerprints, or luminol of Italian fruit juice). It was another case of """"too many kooks spoil the broth"""" and hence, that implies a long-term issue: articles need a limited """"roster of active editors"""" to limit meddling, perhaps have an active count, and when a editor abandons an article, then space opens for another editor to join the roster. The current myth that 500 people can be allowed (to """"adjust"""" an article) is what led to the """"Search engine"""" article becoming a wasteland of chaotic text. Again, it boils down to how should a person choose which articles to develop, versus when they are wasting their expertise in mud-pit articles.

 I need an advocate and help with mediation 

Greetings,

I need an advocate who will walk me through the mediation process.

I am trying to get the following added to the Many Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics.  Max Tegark is a renown physicist and a PhD profressor of cosmology at MIT.  He agrees with my addition.

I am having problem with an editor by the name of Lethe who follows me around Wikipedia reverting all my edits without commentary.

I have tried reasoning with him on discussion pages, but he refuses to read what I write.

Advantages of MWI

If Hugh Everett's theory was just another interpretation of Quantum Mechanics it would have no followers, especially since it proposes the existence of countless other universes which theoretically can never be observed. Because it is not falsifiable it seemingly violates Popper's criteria for a good scientific theory. The reason it has so many adherents is because it offers numerous advantages over the Copenhagen Interpretation, among which are the following:

1. Quantum mechanics becomes a deterministic theory making it more compatible with the theory of relativity and all other physics theory to date which are all deterministic. The Copenhagen Interpretation introduced indeterminacy and randomness into science. Aside from the Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics there is no scientific theory that includes indeterminacy or randomness. Einstein particularly objected to this aspect of the Copenhagen Interpretation. In response to it, he said, """"God does not play dice with the universe.""""

2. It eliminates the """"measurement problem.""""

3. It eliminates Von Neumann's """"boundary problem"""": where to draw the line between the micro world where quantum mechanics applies, and the macro world where it does not. Shortly before his death in 1953, Albert Einstein wrote: """"Like the moon has a definite position whether or not we look at the moon, the same must also hold for the atomic objects, as there is no sharp distinction possible between these and macroscopic objects.""""

4. It eliminates the special place for an observer and human consciousness.

5. It restores objective reality of the universe between measurements. Shortly before his death, Albert Einstein also wrote: """"Observation cannot CREATE an element of reality like a position, there must be something contained in the complete description of physical reality which corresponds to the possibility of observing a position, already before the observation has been actually made.""""

6. The wave-particle duality paradox evaporates. It simply and naturally explains the double-slit experiment. Richard Feynman said, """"[the double-slit experiment] has in it the heart of quantum mechanics. In reality it contains the only mystery."""" David Deutcsh wrote: """". . . the argument for the many worlds was won with the double-slit experiment.""""

7. Schrodinger's Cat paradox evaporates.

It seems Einstein's main objections with quantum mechanics had more to do with the Copenhagen Interpretation, than with quantum mechanics itself. While MWI does not quite generate the kinds of worlds necessary to justify the anthropic principle, it is a step on the way to Stephen Hawking's No Boundary Proposal and Max Tegmark's All Universe Hypothesis which do justify the anthropic principle.

Fine, but keep in mind that this is not solely a matter of being NPOV- this is also a matter of accuracy.  The Eastern Catholic Churches that are in communion with the Vatican are not properly referred to by the term """"Roman Catholic Chruch""""- only those who practice the Latin or Western Rite are.  Take a look at this FAQ on Eastern Catholiscim to see how the term is properly used: .  The only truely accurate way to refer to the church headed by the Vatican is the Catholic Church, and if referring to this church with this title is NPOV, then there is no way that this article can be NPOV and use these terms as accurate as possible.
I was aware that """"Catholic"""" also means universal and is a Mark of the Church- I have to admit that I was not aware that other sects of Christianity use the word """"Catholic"""" in their names.  It is for this reason alone that perhaps there is no really satisfactory way to resolve this issue, and perhaps it is truly best to incorrectly use the term """"Roman Catholic Church"""" to refer to the entire church that is in communion with the Vatican.  I guess in the end it just doesn't matter, so I probably won't press the point any further.

This is a statement regarding your block. First of all, I am the one who has been Wikipedia stalked for over one year now by none other than Delicious Carbuncle, who gave messages through her edits. She followed every single edit and deleted EVERYTHING. She is Pauline Berry and I can provide her IP address if you do not believe me.

She has been too obvious for everyone. I am not accusing her, I have disproved her already with facts. She has absolutely and completely supported and defended the William Travilla exhibition fraud which we exposed to the public as being a 100% criminal fraud. She edited out the facts on the William Travilla page, added links to her friend's website, which is also a commercial website, Melinda Mason who sold copyright infringed DVD's on eBay. 

Next stopthe VANITY FAIR hoax. Delicious Carbuncle started a Wikipedia page for Millington Conroy, after I exposed him for being a forger who fooled the magazine with his fakes.

I am being blocked for telling the truth? Delicious Carbuncle is defaming me on her page, you did not see this?

She claims that her interest is not focused on Marilyn Monroe and or memorabilia? Her edits are telling a different story. 
Next the Name of the Rose. She followed me twice now into that one. I was shooting 14 days for this movie and my part was 'Jorge's Novice and that was named after the monks, who most of them did not have a speaking part at all. Pauline Berry aka Delicious Carbuncle aka 'Restawhile'  followed me to Wikipedia (since she has Internet stalked me for the past three yearssince she is financed by none other than Mark Roesler, one of the defendants in the biggest exhibition fraud in history.)
I am pointing out the facts here. 

She is having a speedy deletion fest and she acts as if she is in charge of running the show. She is not. She cannot turn 100% costume fabrications into original Marilyn Monroe worn costumes, and she tried on her blogs to make sense, because she is part of the project and she is making money off of that fraud.

Now you may think that this edit by Delicious Carbuncle is just 'coincidence' or has nothing to do with Pauline Berry, but until we do not find out who truly is behind Delicious Carbuncle I would ask for fairness in this case and I am asking you to also block this person who has been publicly slandering me, with false accusations, with hypocrite statements and simply with lies.

Now I am aware of the fact that they are working in high numbers, and that it is possible that you, blueboy are part of the group who are supporting a mean and sick fraud project which is out and created solely to defraud the paying public with some foolish fabrications.

Delicious Carbuncle's edit which is a message to Ernest W. Cunningham and Jennifer J. Dickinson.

You be the judge if this is just 'coincidence.'

Please be fair and also block Delicious Carbuncle from further edits. 

You, Blueboy96 state this one: 'True or not, attempting to out another user is beyond unacceptable. Indefblocked. Blueboy96' 

Did you look at Delicious Carbuncle and realize what this person is doing there?!

This edit was posted on Delicious Carbuncle's site and once she realized that she gave herself away, she edited over it, yet I saved it on time.

You have to know that I called up Mrs. Pauline Berry in order to ask her to stop stalking me and to stop supporting one fraud after another. She is a 45 year old musician who also does try Marilyn Monroe imitations from time to time. She asked me years ago for my opinion as an expert on some Marilyn Monroe autographs and I gave he my honest opinion and told her right away that the signed photographs she claimed to have purchased were 100% fakes. She did not take that too well and ever since she is referring to me a 'self proclaimed expert,' she has spent years now on her hateful postings, websites filled with character assassination attempts, comparing me to murderers Charles Manson and John Lennon killer Mark Chapman. Pauline Berry is supporting people who used AIDS infected blood within their intimidation emails and threats. Who threatened to come to my home and burglarize me, harm me, tie me onto a chair and steal my collection. Pauline Berry has been a big part on the public defamation on three people.

Please read the edits of Delicious Carbuncle and see the message. She is referring to my calls to her home, when I attempted to find out why she is supporting criminals.

Who else would this be, instead of Pauline Berry, since only she knew at the time, that I actually called?!

Because I am pretty new to this project and was invited by the Wikipedia policy just to step in and make some edits, I would like apologize for failing to communicate with you effectively, and to clarify a couple of things:

1) I have made in the recent days some substantial contributions and modifications to the Silesia article that I felt would be valuable to the internet readers. I din't expect that some of this changes will meet with such a fierce resistance.

2) These contributions were based on my deep knowledge (in my opinion) and serious studies into the history and modern times of Silesia. My intention was to write about facts and not about opinions, and to avoid any nationalistic bias of any kind.

3) I am very seriously touched that people who introduce most of the chaos and natiolistic bias to this article are the first to accuse others of vandalism and extreme nationalism.

 20:45, 26 Oct 2003 (UTC)

 My suggestion: let's write what Silesia is now 

The Silesia article DO need some serious improvement if we want it to be the valuable and reliable resource for the internet users. The current (restored and protected) version contains so many errors that it will chase away people with basic historical knowledge, if it's not changed as soon as possible.

1) First I suggest that we write what Silesia is now (as this is most interesting to the reader), and not what is was in the past. Silesia rich history should be discussed in the history section.

2) It is unacceptable to state that Silesia lies between Odra and Vistula rivers. First look at any map will show you that Silesia lies along the Odra river.

3) Silesia lies today in Poland and Czech Republic. It is doubtful if the Goerlitz area is part of Silesia. It is a historical part of Lusatia, and was joined to the Silesian province after 1816.

4) Im my opinion we should not discuss Silesian history in the intro paragraph, but we decide to, it is unacceptable to mention only the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation

5) I do not care in what order the language-names of Silesia are mentioned, but I do insist that the Silesian version (Ślónsk, Ślunsk) is included in this list. 

6) I do insist that the various nationalities and ethnic groups living know in SIlesia, are mentioned clearly and the list should include at least: the Silesians, the Poles, the Germans, the Czechs

7) The theories about the name of the region must be clearly marked as theories and not as facts. The passages need some minor rewrite.

8) The remarks about HRE overlordship in 1146 and 1163 are simply false, no longer upheld by the German historians, and must be removed

9) Great care must be taken when dealing with Silesian history, for example the rude remarks about devastation was caused by Hussite rebellion must be rewritten using neutral words

10) The Silesia article need more sections on the People, Economy, Culture, Education, Science and Tourism.

Now both Jayron32 and Fram are having memory lapses about how they did what they did, we are lucky to have diffs that can't lie. Fram's deletion conceals both my page and its history, that he uses to count the contributions. Fram says that the contribution by Baseball Bugs that Fram also deleted was """"minor"""". Is that supposed to mean """"unworthy""""? When Baseball Bugs posts to my page and the post is sensible, as it was, then no third person may delete it. But to Jayron32 and Fram, BB's post is merely collateral damage. Access to my deleted page, which I have asked for and been denied, will reveal that I was interrupted in the process of scanning the Ref. Desk archive. Anyone can do that because it's publically accessible. I became a humble recipient of The Reference Desk Barnstar (scroll up to see it) when I showed objective results. The first result showed Jayron32's contribution of references at RD/M to be among the highest, which likely gave Jayron32 satisfaction. That is understandable but I and many others cautioned that the measurement does not assess the quality of answers. The software I use may be improved but it would lose all credibility of objectivity if I allowed it to be biassed by anyone's feeling of being flattered or attacked by its output. @Fram, if you want AGF then stop hiding the page you deleted and it will be seen to be not just about Jayron32, it doesn't even contain the word """"mistake"""", and it has a portion still under construction.

(Ivo Banac)...A bit of nonteleological history
One of the great problems is that our understanding of the common and individual histories of the South Slavs and the other peoples of southeastern Europe has not significantly benefited from critical historiography. This is because nationalist historiographies regularly have explained modern developments as an aspect of unilinear design. We have been taught to see connections that may be of our own making. For example, if we look at a current political map of the area and compare it to that from the era of settlements we will see that the present political divisions do not correspond to those from the early medieval period. Croatia is mainly a coastal area from the Rasa River in Istria to the Cetina River, a little bit to the east of the city of Split. Down the coast from the original Croatia, we have a row of unfamiliar Slavic territories that Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus, the tenth-century Byzantine emperor-historian, called Pagania (literally, land of the pagans), Zachlumia (most of present-day eastern Herzegovina, with the Croatian peninsula of Peljesac), Terbounia (the Trebinje area of eastern Herzegovina, with Dubrovnik and its eastern coastal environs), and Dioclea (the southern portions of contemporary Montenegro with the Bay of Kotor and the northwesternmost portions of present-day Albania around Lake Skadar/Shkoder). Serbia is located in the hinterland of Zachlumia, Terbounia, and Dioclea, its center around Ras, near today's Novi Pazar, in the Sandzak. Bosnia was apparently within this territory, but represented a negligible area around the source of the Bosna River, where we now find Sarajevo and its environs. And Dalmatia? In the tenth-century this was a necklace of Byzantine-ruled Roman coastal cities and island territories, from Krk in the north to Ulcinj in the south.

Moreover, modern territoriality required a tradition that was itself a product of modernity. Thus, unrelated traditions were merged to produce an idea of ethnic-as opposed to cultural-continuity. The Croat historical tradition goes back to the Chronicle of the Priest of Dioclea (a twelfth-century text from Bar in contemporary Montenegro) and its various translations (for example, Marko Marulic, 1510), which were in turn incorporated into the Early Modern """"Slavic"""" and """"Dalmatian"""" histories of Mavro Orbin (1601) and Ivan Lucic (Ioannes Lucius, 1666). These works then became material for the Croatianizing work of Pavao Ritter Vitezovic (Croatia rediviva, 1700), who was the most important influence on the revivalist generation of Ljudevit Gaj (1809-1872) and that of postrevival integral nationalists like Ante Starcevic (1823-1896). Curiously, the same histories (Orbin's) were Serbianized through the translations of Sava Vladislavic (1722), which then influenced the pioneering Serbian histories of Jovan Rajic (1794), and were Bulgarianized in the history of Paisij Hilandarski (1762). The Bosnian historical tradition was somewhat more self-contained. It combined the Franciscan memory of medieval Bosnian statehood with the experiences of Muslim ayan (notable) selfrule to argue for a uninational Bosnia (for example, Antun Knezevic, whose book was published between 1884 and 1887).

Clearly, something has happened in the span of ten centuries. Pagania, Zachlumia, and Terbounia have disappeared. The center of Croatia has migrated from the Adriatic to the north, into medieval Slavonia (literally, Slavic land), with Zagreb at its head. This happened in stages. During the High Middle Ages, the heart of Croatia was on the Una River, now in northwestern Bosnia. This territory (Turkish Croatia) was lost to the Ottomans in the sixteenth century and became a part of Bosnia. During the Habsburg reconquest and the concomitant Venetian operations in the seventeenth century, the framework of modern Croatia emerged in two extended shanks-one, to the north, to modern Slavonia; the other, in the south, in modern Dalmatia. At the same time, the Zagreb area, which was only dubiously Croatian in the early Middle Ages, became the heart of modern Croatia.

The story of Serbia is not much different. Serbia first migrated to the coast and assimilated Dioclea. Then it moved to the Ibar-Morava valleys; then toward the valleys of Struma and Vardar in Macedonia. It reached the Danube only as an Ottoman vassal in the fifteenth century. And its modern capital, Belgrade, became truly Serbian only in the course of Karadjordje's uprising in 1806. Bosnia, too, expanded under Ban (or prorex) Kulin (r. 1180-1204) into the Donji Kraji (literally, Lower Lands) around the Vrbas River and the Soli (literally, Salt Lands; for centuries, Ottoman, then modern Tuzla) and Usora, in its present northeastern corner. Later on, at the height of its power in fourteenth century, Bosnia expanded into Hum (Herzegovina) and the Drina River valley. The westernmost regions were inc",0.0

I sometimes follow the news of blink-182 and there has been no evidence that the band is still together during the hiatus. Singer Tom DeLonge said that he hasn't heard from the rest of the members (Mark Hoppus and Travis Barker) since the day the band went on hiatus. So, that's why we should leave it as """"blink-182 was"""". If anyone changes it back to """"blink-182 is"""", that means the band is no longer on hiatus, but they still are.  """,0.0

"Dear Macrakis: I was the one who gave that exact solution in the first place. The golden ratio naturally appears in the 5th roots of unity; if you plot the roots in the complex plane, they form the vertices of a pentagon. This then explains why you can express a lot of trigonometric angles pi*n/5 in terms of the golden ratio. For example, cos 18 = (b/4)sqrt[2] = 5^(1/4)/2 sqrt[φ].  When you solve a quintic equation, naturally the fifth roots of unity are involved, hence why the radical solution of the quintic x^5-5x+12 = 0 can be expressed in terms of the golden ratio.  I hope it is clearer now.",0.0

""", it is not even good for a mediocre blog.

Basic logic has been twisted here, language is very fuzzy:  Like """"arguments [have] shown to be inaccurate"""" but it doesn't say which arguments. E.g. """"work harder"""" would be proven to be inaccurate (?), because """"Greeks on average spend 8 hours a day at work"""". To show the flawed logic: Everybody knows that in a communist country there is 0% unemployment, 100% are working, like 8h days. Does it mean everybody works hard in communist countries? Nobody would say that. If everybody works hard the question would be why there so not sufficient output in the economy. Just flawed.

 From Norway; Denmark; Iceland; Scotland; England(Bristol etc.); Wales; Ireland; Basques & Others(""""again"""",more data) 

by Gunnar Thompson

""""On DeVirga's map, the northwestern continent is called """"Norveca.""""  This title, appearing under the symbol of a crown, identifies the huge land as a province under the sovereignty of Norway.  Other maps also show a huge land attached to northern Norway.  On the 14th-century Andreas Walsperger map, the region is called """"Regnii Norwegie"""" (the realm of Norway); maps by Sebastian Munster (1532) and Joachim Von Watt (1534) call the region """"Septentrio;"""" a circular map by Battista Agnese 1543 shows """"Terra Nova"""" extending from Norway to the North Pole.  

Maps that portray a huge northern territory reflect the 1261 proclamation of King Haakon IV extending Norse sovereignty over all the lands from Norway to the North Pole.  The """"North Pole"""" he had in mind was the magneticnot the geographic pole.  A 14th-century writer, Philippe de Mezieres, reported that Norway's overseas realm was so extensive that it took three years for the king's tax collectors to complete their rounds and return to Bergen.  

One of the territories that Haakon annexed in a 1262 treaty along with Greenland and Iceland was an otherwise obscure place called landanu or """"New Land.""""  The Kongfriget Norges historie (1778) identified an Icelander named Rolf as the discoverer of this New Landalso known as Nyalandin 1258.  It was also identified as part of the North American mainland.  Bishop Gissur Einarsson noted that the direction of sailing to Nyaland from Iceland was southwest.  In that direction lies Newfoundland and the Gulf of St. Lawrence.  

The region had many names that changed over the years as successive waves of Europeans landed on its shores.  As late as 1347, Icelanders referred to Newfoundland as """"Markland""""which was an ongoing source of lumber.  Sailors from Bristol called the coastal isles """"the Icelands.""""  Circa 1350, a Spanish Franciscan reported an isle called """"Ibernia"""" in the northwest Atlantic that was under Norse sovereignty.  After that date, Bubonic Plague swept through European cities devastating maritime centers.  Norway was particularly hard hitforcing the abandonment of overseas colonies.  English, Portuguese, French, German, and Danish merchants fought over the western isles.  After 1380, Denmark took control of Greenland, Iceland, and mainland in eastern Canada.  The """"new"""" Danish mainland appears on the Claudius Clavus map of 1424 as """"Gronlandia Provincia.""""  Thus, the name """"Norveca"""" was already archaic by the early 15th century when it found its way onto DeVirga's map.  Portuguese maps of the early 16th century feature the names of Joao Fernandes (The Labrador) and the Corte-Real family along the East Coast of North America...""""  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 212.113.163.75   
Gunnar Thompson has also published on Marco Polo’s secret missions to Canada and the ancient Egyptian colonization of Mexico. He has compiled an """"Extensive collection of evidence (maps, artifacts, and cultural similarities) of voyages to North America before Columbus, by Phoenicians, Norse, Celts, Britons, Jews, Greeks, Irish, Romans, Japanese, Hindus, Indo-Sumerians, and Chinese. Native Americans are the first discoverers, occupying the Americas for at least 300,000 years."""" (from the Laura Lee radio show website) He is as reliable a source as Gavin Menzies. He has told me that the word hurricane comes from the ancient Greek.   

Well, the dear Dougweller can claim quite rightly in many cases that the relate of Marco Polo could be speculation, however Gunnar Thompson cites the words of his own reporting and book, book attributed to him, Marco Polo, as a documental source for these claims in the American Pacific coast, as well as indirect sources more speculative on the several centuries later(and even from his time) world maps, wich indicate where the lands designated by the Chinese and by the Venetian-Dalmatian Explorer were.

Some of these uploads are music, some are comedy, some are anti BNP/EDL. None are espousing a particular movement, political group or ideology. However, due to the fact that I espouse equality and fairness & am opposed to unwarranted victimisation, oppression of minorities, hatred and ignorance it seems that certain users like to think of it as a soapbox to spew their racist, misogynistic, homophobic, xenophobic and hate-filled gibberish....the BNPers, of course, are guilty of all the aforementioned.

Apparently my decision not to allow comments that are basically spam, lazy insults, illiterate ramblings and screeching from morons who don't listen (but just use the channel as their own forum) means I am anti free speech. I don't think our ancestors fought against fascism and for the right for freedom of speech to have hate-filled knuckle draggers abuse that by screeching hate-filled drivel bereft of facts, decency or, indeed, a point.

I do actively encourage freedom of speech for all, quite often letting idiots speak makes them look far more idiotic than I ever could hope. There is a difference between debate and spamming, insulting, not listening and preaching though.

I'm happy to debate, but a debate consists of two sides discussing their views, not one shouting and refusing to listen to anyone else. It is my channel and I have the right not to allow trolls, clones, neo Nazis, racists, haters and all round ne'er do wells the right to puke bile all over it....this is not suppression of freedom of speech and if anyone cares to look back through my channel they will see I actively encourage debate, but also see how so many choose to eschew debate in favour of:
1. Attempting to belittle, hurl abuse and calling me UAF/Marxist/far left/rapist/paedophile with absolutely no basis (libelous in reality).
2. Personal insults, accusing me of being a foreigner, bringing my family into it (they love a """"mum"""" insult) and accusing me of being several users because they can't believe more than one person can disagree.
3. Misquoting, paraphrasing and cherry picking """"research"""" from questionable sources and only ever """"research"""" or accept sources that back up their own beliefs.
4. Lying, accusing me of acts I haven't done and claiming they have """"won"""" the argument when they have ignored the points I raised and just harped on and on.
5. Cloning my account on here and also using my username on far right forums. They have cloned me numerous times.
6. Waffling on about being deprived of freedom of speech (to make insults and allow no right to reply by blocking me from their channels)

Basically, these goons make up a tiny minority of incredibly arrogant, ignorant, spiteful, indecent, amoral, borderline illiterate joy sappers; BNP, EDL, neo Nazis, Islamophobes, extremists, KKK, you name it. THEY are what is wrong with the world and they are what is trying to stop us evolving; their motivation is hatred and ignorance....proven by their labelling of everyone who disagrees with them as communists, UAF, Marxists and Liberals (and more unbelievably fascists?!?) with no basis. Of course, they are just lazy epithets to group the majority into one category when their opposition is made up of a multitude of individuals from left to right, of different coloured skin and beliefs, sexualities, classes, background etc....the majority basically.

Youtube grants these guttersnipes the anonymity to parade their ignorance and disgusting ideals and appear to be a larger group than they are. They are fooling themselves though, they will always be a minority of failures who blame their own failure in life on everyone but themselves. Ironically, our ancestors who fought for every freedom they treasure now are having it spat back in their face with every ill informed, erroneous, indecent and anti educational rant these idiots post.

I encourage debate, NOT bickering, childish playground taunts or interminable clowns on their soapbox refusing to listen to others. It is still possible to get a viewpoint across without resorting to actions a 5 year old would sneer at.

These types are incredibly easy to expose for what they are, they do half the job themselves and not one of them has yet """"defeated"""" me or shut me up. Not only do I have the majority on my side but also facts and common sense.....they have none of this.

I asked you to prove you can't appeal an ITN decision, not whether you had ever seen it done or not. The appeal venue is obviously the talk page, or I suppose the talk page of the person who made the decision. I went to the talk page, and nobody said I couldn't appeal, they just rejected it out of hand. If I contravened the no appeal rule, they're certainly being very coy about it. And quite obviously it doesn't take 7 days to figure out if a decision was wrong - and in case you hadn't noticed, 4 days later and Gerry Adams is still under arrest, and it's still in the news, so even in this case, I'm sure if Wikipedia wasn't such a dysfunctional place, the veracity of the original decision could have been examined exhaustively by now. But no, you all seem to prefer to handle it quite differently - prefering to talk endless rubbish about sticks and horses and telling people they don't understand things, things that you're all not even prepared to answer a few simple questions about.

I have repeatedly expressed the opinion that the most idiotic, as opposed to merely lazy, thing that Tyson has been revealed to have done was to listen to Bush's Biblical quotation and write a note to himself (which in the event he was too lazy to locate) to the effect, apparently, that Bush had clowned himself by taking credit for star names that were actually Arabic. So, since I wrote the words you complain about, it should be obvious that they are not intended to make Tyson seem in any way correct. I would be in favor of making this clearer by quoting someone to the effect that attributing to Isaiah the intent to take credit for star charts drawn up a millennia after Isaiah's death is profoundly stupid, but I was in a hurry to replace a vacancy on the page and an appropriate source didn't spring to mind. In any case, I am adamantly opposed to the change you propose, since it removes all specifics, leaving a tasteless gruel, and I don't see anything particularly """"encyclopedic"""" about bad writing. The bit about Yahweh is directly from Tyson's acknowledgement of error on Facebook, btw, where he still shows no inkling of how moronic his interpretation of Bush's Biblical quotation is.   """,0.0

By your last sentence, (20:59 30 April) it would seem that we are, perhaps, getting a little closer to nub of our discussion. The article is about his work. The fact that a very large amount of his original work, some 4000 negetives, has survived and been kept together in just two large collections for approximately 100 years is one of the main planks of his notability. The other plank is when and where he practiced. The subjects of his photographs, the people, their clothes, their floating and their static palaces etc. etc. is what is notable.  This collection is a unique, historical, visual record of a long dead era. It is not just a collection of photos of old boats. Kirk was uniquely positioned to photograph a distillation of an aspect of society. That aspect of society existed here and there, now and then, throughout this and other countries. But it came together for a short period each year at Cowes in what I have called a distillation. He did photograph it and his work has remained together, its existence, until recently, known only to a small group.

The trustees of the two collections feel, I am sure, that the photographs are too valuable to be published willy nilly on the internet.  In any event that would be impractical and was not my intention. My plan had been to try to make the collection's scope known. Not as an advertisment but as a dissemination of information.

As an analogy consider the article about a national collection described in page 10 of today's Guardian. The article describes the collection and claims or advocates its importance.  The Collection was started as the Fawcett Library.  Biographical details of Millicent Fawcett are not central to the theme of the article, an account and illustration of the contents of the collection is.   15:00, 1 May",0.0

Stone Censors
I don’t know that I’m wrong; in fact, I’m quite certain that you and AuburnPilot are in the wrong. You can censor me and block me all you want – you’ve got the power – but you can’t make me confess to wrongs of which I am innocent. Not yet, anyway. And you can’t make me say that you’re right, when you are as wrong as hell. It’s about time somebody talked back to you.

“If you were to discuss your edits, you won't [sic] be in this position right now.” (Since I had already discussed my edits, physicq’s statement above is a case of “a false statement made with deliberate intent to deceive; an intentional untruth; a falsehood.”)

That’s funny peculiar, because wikicensors with the correct politics somehow never have to “discuss” their “edits.” They just go and censor people with whom they disagree, and then demand that the censees justify the worth of the censored passages or links or footnotes. And guess what? The censees’ explanations, no matter how well-founded and eloquent, are never sufficient to make the censors change their minds. Once an editor realizes that nothing he says will have any positive effect on the censors (or should I say, """"commissars""""?), he would be a fool to waste his time and energy trying to change that which cannot be changed. That the censors continue demanding such arguments is because they have a sadistic glee for wasting other people’s precious time and energy.

In case an open-minded (but perhaps less experienced) reader should suspect that I am just engaging in bluster, I had already made my argument in my previous entry on this page (which AuburnPilot has archived in a handsome tan box at the bottom of User_talk:AuburnPilot under the uncivil category, “spam”) for why the footnotes and links I inserted were legitimate, but physicq aka physicq210 derided those arguments as a “polemic, complete with fallacious personal attacks,” and mocked my criticism of his abuse of authority as “whining.” In one case, I pointed out that the external link that AuburnPilot defamed as “spam” and censored, was a classic magazine article related to the  Racial Profiling Hoax.

(Speaking of which, Wikipedia's Racial profiling article is hopelessly POV through the censors’ deleting of links to articles debunking the hoax, and inserting of links to fraudulent “literature” such as thoroughly debunked work by the ACLU.)

In the case of a footnote that AuburnPilot also defamed as “spam” and censored, he cut the longest, most thorough exposé yet published on the  Duke Rape Hoax, which was published by the most brilliant, reliable magazine on the Web, VDARE.

BTW, AuburnPilot asserts that the sources in question are not “reliable” or “verifiable,” and do not maintain “neutrality.” Aside from the fact that thousands of Wikipedia articles are transparent political propaganda, or no more than love or hate letters to certain public figures (particularly entertainers or athletes), AuburnPilot has misrepresented the Wikipedia rule on neutrality. There is no requirement that every source be neutral (as opposed to reliable and verifiable), only that every Wikipedia article be neutral.

WP:NPOV

“All Wikipedia articles must be written from a neutral point of view (NPOV), representing fairly and without bias all significant views that have been published by a reliable source. For guidance on how to make an article conform to the neutral point of view, see the NPOV tutorial.”

As for “verifiablilty,” the VDARE source has over 100 hyperlinks to supporting documentation from newspapers, magazines, TV and radio news organizations, and legal filings; if that isn’t “verifiable,” then nothing is.

Now, I ask you. If I have already made my best argument for including the aforementioned links and footnotes, and physicq aka physicq210 responds by misrepresenting what I said, claiming that I have made no attempt at supporting my position, and referring to my defense as “whining,” what possible reason could I have for continuing such a charade?

Plus, why should I be on the defensive? If I were dealing with fair, reasonable people, that might make sense. But fair, reasonable people would not do as AuburnPilot did, and first censor my edits, and then demand I justify their value on the talk pages. (And physicq would not have responded to an edit war by throwing in with AuburnPilot, immediately blocking me, and charging me with “disruptive edits.” That alone is proof of physicq’s unfitness as an administrator.) No, AuburnPilot would not have censored my work, but would have asked me on the talk page why I thought it belonged. No, strike that. He would have hit the links and read the articles in question.

"Strong support.  If anything one can make the point that Mary Miller (actress) is the primary use.  Just because some one writes books and they are used as sources in articles is not a good way to determine primary use.  I'd argue that the 59 references used to write the Mary Miller (actress) implies a much more notable person and better makes the case then another article that is based on only a single reference.  I think that adding Mary Millar in the list of statistics confuses many since it is just a similar spelling and that would be better handled as a See also on the dab page.  Obviously this means that the current page needs to be disambiguated to Mary Miller (art historian) to allow the dab page to be moved.  Using the statistics provided in opposition to this proposal clearly shows that, if anything, the current article does not even receive a majority of the hits.  So while that is not a good way of proving primary use, in this case it makes a strong case that there is no obvious primary use so the dab page should be moved.

 Outback gothic 

With this edit, an editor recently reinstated some text about Australian horror films. In the edit summary, it was stated """"First, a film doesn't have to be internationally famous to be part of the Australian film culture. Second, the theme of outback gothic has been dissembled for no reason because it listed a couple of less famous films."""" I took a look at the only citation in the reinstated text, and I see a key problem - it doesn't support the text in the article. The source doesn't support the sentence """"A major theme of Australian cinema has been survival in the harsh Australian landscape."""", it doesn't use the term """"outback gothic"""", and doesn't mention most of the quoted films, such as Wake in Fright, The Cars That Ate Paris, Shame etc etc. In fac the only sentence which the source supoprts is the one that was already in the article before the edit was made: """"Saw (2004) and Wolf Creek (2005) are credited with the revival of Australian horror."""" For now I am reverting the edit. If someone has some reliable sources, then further revisions may be warranted, bearing in mind that one of the issues that a couple of us editing this article have been concerned about is its great length, which is contributed to by long lists of stuff, and minor material.

Hi Andjam,
In order to """"prove"""" who was an editor, all you need are old copies of the newspaper I would imagine, so I can't see how the non citation issue applies here.  
 
I added a lot of these in over period because many of them are notables, for example John Paul Byrne is a published playwright, Trish Pender a published poet and author, Gabby Milgate an actor in Muriel's Wedding and a radio breakfast host, Julia Leigh is a prize winning Author, Anthony Sharwood a senior writer for Alpha magazine, Michael Fullilove is Program Director for Global Issues at the Lowy institute and so on.  

Sould I also suggest that it's also a bit insulting to these people to describe them as """"non notable people"""" on the world wide web?  Working as an adviser to the Prime Miniter (Michael Fullilove) or appearing on the news singing your hit single (Kylie Burtland) is what I'd call notable.

As you'd imagine it will take a bit of time to cite of all these, but I included them because someone pointed out we needed more history.  I don't care either way but I did put a bit of work into the research so...""",0.0

I think the Tall Ships stuff in the article is getting off topic, and should properly be in Tall ship, since it relates primarily to a discussion of Tall Ships and only secondarily to sail training. And I hacked about with the first para, for the reason that I was uncomfortable with the word """"unconventional"""" when from the initial words, sail training must once have been very conventional, albeit presumably Nelson would not have known it by that name. 

I think, also, you may be being a bit didactic (though I've never been sure about the meaning of that word...) First and foremost, sail training is not intended to be like a vacation. or With many options out there, it can be a difficult choice . I'm not sure what advice to give to change anything, but it sails close to being a promotional piece - albeit of the very highest quality - for sail training, rather than an encyclopedia article about sail training.

 Capitalisation of waterways features 

Hi. Can you please point me to the WP:MOS page that says all individual bridges, tunnels, locks, etc must be described in lower case? As far as I am concerned, Basingstoke Canal and Foxton Locks are proper nouns and should be capitalised as such. It is correct to talk about """"the locks at Foxton"""", and """"the canal in Basingstoke"""", but using mixed capitalisation is misleading: Foxton locks suggests a type of lock known as 'Foxton'.  You could not correctly say a Bath deep lock, unless there was more than one of them: one would write 'the Bath Deep Lock. There is only one """"Bath Deep Lock"""" so """"Bath deep lock"""" is not an appropriate nomenclature, however Bath chair and Bath bun describe generic items and should not be capitalised.

Could you please double-check your reference for this format and apply the necessary corrections? Thank you.

"""::(1) The french engines (40 HP) were superior, to those the Wright brothers claimed they built (less than 20 HP), being more powerful. (2) The brothers used the same catapult, the same extra boost, as in 1905 in all their witnessed flights performed in 1908. In conclusion more powerful engines were logically not needed.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 70.83.114.138   

Correct, they didn't """"need"""" more powerful engines in 1908, but were probably glad to have them. However, your conclusion that therefore their statements about their previous flights are """"their own fiction"""" is merely your own fanciful opinion, to which you're entitled, but which flies in the face of more than 100 years of published information and, yes, the WB own documentary proof, undisputed by all reputable historians. The 1-minute 45-second flight you mentioned was Wilbur's very first in France; about a month later he flew 90 minutes (after Orville had made hour-long flights in the U.S.).   
 I base all my affirmations on primary sources and not latter judgements. The so called reputed historians are just pro Wright Brothers propagandists who simply selected what they liked from primary sources and made up a nice story for the public, disregarding all evidence that throws serious doubts regarding the claimed 1903-1905 flights.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 70.83.114.138   

Interestingly, the primary sources of which you're fond include voluminous amounts of documentation by the WB themselves of their work and their success. Try some affirmation based on that. You're right, though: propaganda does existnot in the writings of respected historians, but in misguided scribblings that sometimes show up on these pages.   

There is mention of the seven """"French"""" engines of 1908 here:  http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6550620m/f260.image.r=wright.langEN. They are intended to be delivered as  """"seven perfect copies"""" of the model brought by the american aviator.   

 Strange picture - On Dec. 14, 1903, W. Wright flew with the two propellers on the left side of the plane, one of them not connected to the engine! 

The picture labeled LC-W86- 20, (see http://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/wri/item/2001696254/ ) from the Library of Congress, shows W. Wright just after he landed the plane on Dec. 14, 1903, damaging the front-rudder (the canard double wing). The flight was powered but the airplane landed below the altitude where it had taken off. The strange thing about this picture is that the plane (see one of the large size versions of the image) has both propellers on its left side, the leftmost propeller being not connected to the engine. There is simply no logical explanation about this oddity. 

""""There is simply no logical explanation about this oddity."""" Indeed, a perfect description of the posts above and below. I recommend an optometrist.   
Ok. It was my mistake. I was mislead by the optical illusion the image contains. I should have studied the photography more carefully.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 70.83.114.138

Concentrate: It is prohibited to work as a guide when you have no licence. This rule holds almost everywhere in the world. This has become quite a big problem even for Slovak persons in Bratislava (I know that from direct personal experience, they were very strict with this) The local policeman (or ward or whoever) thought that this rule was broken in that particular case and therefore the non-guide was interrogated. That is all, an absolutely normal situation. The fact that the non-guide was a Hungarian is a coincidence (after all they are not the only Hungarian tourists in Slovakia), this is not the first case of such interrogations, and the fact that the policeman was probably wrong is also nothing special (although this is not sure, as far as I remember).

In England, Italy or Spain 16th century were described entirely different types of falsettos. On the top of it, Mr 4meter4 perhaps never heard Pavarotti singing falsetto, or the falsetto of Ian Gillan. Singing of King Diamond is based on falsetto. What about Michael Kiske? Is it not falsetto? Mariah Carey or Whitney Houston do (did) not sing falsetto? Does any of these falsettos sound breathy? Not to me. Isn't out there published a note about those? Maybe only because 4meter4 does not look for it. Why? It would not fit to his article. He would have to admit that his ONLY source Vennard was probably having in the chair something else than falsetto or he was drunk. 4meter4 quickly opened two or three books and things he had swallowed the World.

 WW2 casualties 

I think some more narrative prose is a good idea. The main tables should still be there for easy lookup, but the topic is complex, often controversial, and different sources have different numbers. And all this could/should be elaborated on and explained in the article, yes. Many people will come to the page with numbers on their """"own"""" country that they have learned or read, and we should have some text explaining more thorowly what the numbers we list include. And that's probably best done outside tables and in addition to just simple footnotes.

Maybe we could also have separate casuality sections for the different (major) countries, with text and tables where there could be made room for lower and upper bounds on numbers and space for citing different sources and their numbers. Not so much that I expect you to find and look up every different estimate, but there are many people editing and there could be a value in having room for those comming here later with different sources to add to the information. I don't know.

But I really like your work so far. It was about time that we got some well-sourced numbers in this article. Well done!  """,0.0

Most of your edits are fine. Thank you for restoring previous edits in a non-POV way which I think is acceptable. Most of the article is fine. I will just question two points. First I am not sure what you have accomplished by suppressing the publishers' understanding of the Singapore Math method. You may disagree with them, but it is still valid in a Wikipedia article to report what the publisher believes about their own work. I actually agree with much of your evaluation, but in order to keep Wikipedia neutral, our opinions should not be used to decide what to report and what not to report. The publisher's own description of their books should be included in this article. Perhaps you could write it in a way that makes it more clear that this is the publisher's own (and perhaps biased) opinion?

Second, if you suppress the reason why the National Math Panel believes Singapore Math to be exemplary, you should delete the entire reference to this fact. You may disagree with the Math Panel's thinking, but the fact is that this (and Singapore's success on international tests) is the only reason Singapore Math was cited in their report. By deleting what the Math Panel said leaves the reader under the impression that the Math Panel reviewed Singapore Math (they did not) and are in agreement with all of the features of Singapore Math. Their precise statement was, """"The Singapore standards (Singapore Ministry of Education, 2006) provide an established example of curriculum standards designed to develop proficiency in a relatively small number of important mathematics topics, as validated by a recent analysis (Ginsburg et al., 2005).""""""",0.0

Hi, everybody. I just stumbled by this little edit war, and would like to make a few suggestions. As this article stands, it's a jumbled mess. I believe that Marie is correct, in that some semblance of encyclopedic structure needs to be used in this article. I have great respect for Logger9's expertize in these subjects that so greatly interest me, and his willingness to back everything up with a source. However, to Logger9, I think a liitle guidance may be helpful in composing a proper encyclopedia structure. Encyclopedic writing is not like scientific writing.

To make it simple, an encyclopedia needs to be written in a journalistic format. The most important information is delivered as quickly as possible, in the first few sentences. This is done using the fewest amount of words possible, and should written so even a child can make snese of it, (at a 6th grade level). We call this the """"lede,"""" and the only purpose of the lede is to answer the question, """"What is a liquid?"""" It should be no more than a paragraph or two.

On a subject such as this, an """"intro"""" section would be appropriate. This is just an expanded lede. This may seem a bit redundant, but is actually extremely useful. Some people coming to this article will know absolutely nothing about science, and don't want the feeling of being thrown into a college level class head first. The intro should be written at about a 10th grade level, explaining the scientific aspects in the simplest of terms. (Imagine you're teaching a 10th grade science class. How would you explain it to them?)

Then, the following sections should get into college level explanations. It is perfectly acceptable to describe well established theories, and the histories behind those theories, but be careful to make it brief. The article is meant to answer the question of what a liquid is, and should not stray into the History of liquid theory. Also, when giving theory, realize that a scientific theory is really just a very well thought opinion, and should be attributed to its source. Under no circumstances should we combine theories in a way that might lead the reader to a third conclusion, unintended by the original sources. Nor should we give the impression that any theory is somehow absolute truth.

Also, you will find that most readers want information to be in its correct place. I have seen instances in the past where information was copied and pasted directly from one article to the next. This sort of redundency is usually unnecessary. It's better to add a link to the article where the info is most relevant. And, it is also very distasteful in writing to copy, even from oneself. If it is absolutely necessary to have the same info in multiple articles, then the writing should still be original. The goal is to make articles succinct ... to fulfill the readers curiosity about a subject and only that subject, but to link to any related subject that may further the reader's knowledge. By using this format, it helps satisfy everyone's curiosity before they become bored and move on.

To Marie, I'm glad you explained that English is not your first language, because at first I did think the tone was a little harsh, but now it makes sense. I think Logger9 has some very useful contributions to make, so I'd love to see a discussion on how to incorporate them into appropriate places. I'm fascinated by the science, and would love it if we all could work together to make it understandable to all. (I'm sure you both are far more knowledible than I am.) To everybody, please use your edit summaries! There are many people watching, and edit summaries save us all alot of time.   """,0.0

Fair enough. The closing editor at the second AfD wrote """"...Any appeal should be made at WP:Deletion review..."""" so the next step is Wikipedia:Deletion review if anyone wants to create it. I actually unprotected this and stubbed it for an editor today, but then quickly reverted myself. I just don't have much experience with band-related articles, so I'll stay out of this one.

This is where I - as one of the erroneiously accused """" meatpuppets """" respond ;

Just out of interest, who do you think this nark  is and why is he so motivated to go about doing what he is doing? I put this record up in the open for you and them to see because I have no and have had no connection with you nor any of the journal pages and, frankly, I take offence at being called a meat or sockpuppet of yours when I am not. I am sure that you are just or even more upset as being accused of a connection with me when you have none.

Unfortunately though, that is the depth of 's lies and the shallowness of 's integrity. 

 Where he has no grounds he invents them and he is, oh, so clever at playing WikiTricks with all these technical terms and methods. 

I am starting to feel like a Jew in Nazi Germany being hunted down, connected to individuals which I have no connection with and their so-called crimes and accused of crimes which are not mine. 

And what of ? He just seems to get off on throwing around his weight whilst avoiding entering into the actually factual discussion.

For the record - and let them love every minute of their persecution syndrome, let them avidly copy and paste and make little weblinks to this as they are so good at Wikitricks - I am a vegan of 20 years or more standing and, arguably, MacDonald of Clanranald. I became involved in editing the vegan article before you returned to it recently. I am entirely responsible for kicking this whole thing off because I refused to let  get away with his ridiculous domination of the article and I put  in the same category for his anorexic stuff. 

From my point of view, my objections are largely literary. The article became too bloated and required editing down. It is merely meant to be a definition of what vegan is. I don't see any point in actually engaging in those that oppose veganism. I don't even support vegan's trying to counter counter-vegan propaganda on the Wiki. It is best to keep it short and simple and give a few links so that folks that are interested can go find out more.

I approached  reasonably and got the same sort of response as you did, see ; . When  started to engage in his revisions without consultation, I tried to engage him in reasonable discussion, see ; . But he just ignores it.

Fine. I showed respect, they showed themselves for what they are.

I find it weird in a way that individuals can become so obsessed by something that they obviously do not love but instead want to demean or destroy - and that means you now - and are willing to invest so much time and energy into it.

I could understand it if  was a paid employee of the meat industry - he says he has professional scientific interest in animal husbandry. That would just make him a paid publicist. But if he is doing this and attacking you in his own free time, I pity him deeply.

""""What were you doing all this evening on your computer, darling?"""" His wee wifie asks him.

 It is amazing that Wikipedia lets this person, who is obsessively attacking another user, continue without criticism.  This person has such an extreme amount of time on his hands that he attempts to catalog diffs against another user, even surmising (with absolutely no proof) what accounts may belong to a user that are literally years old.  That this user has a Myspace page like Noclador, that has a statement such as """"noclador is ever victorious -)"""" should demonstrate what small-minded intentions he has in life.  I do pity him.  That users like PhJ and Gryffindor back him up are no surprise.  Gryffindor, as I've said before, is one of the most unethical Administrators I've ever witnessed on Wikipedia.

 biggest problem? 

the only problem with all of this is that Wikipedia IS evil.
With all of the rules and all of the noise, what it still comes
down to is a mob of people doing whatever they want as a mob, against reason, against fairness, against logic, and against truth.
Theres no way to deal with abuse and no recourse for the abused. The place runs on ad hominems and pack psychology. It panders to the lowest common denominator, and in the end its articles are well neutered of any actual depth content or meaning. """"Neutrality"""" as a buzzword is used to emascualte a topic so that it has no political
implications or consequences. The same standing is given to a pov warrior and a pet admin as is given to a knowledgable expert. Opinion rules here, not wisdom, and not even any real form of neutrality. Wikipedia IS factually evil. The question here, is how
to go about fixing that problem. Denial won't help.

Well, enough bothering with pearls and swine for today, my """"contributions"""" file should speak for itself. I have been involved in 3 vfds since showing up, each one of which was run on ad hominems and straw man attacks. I have been blocked on trumped up charges by a pov warrior and his pet rogue admin. I have sought from every corner of Wikipedia some sort of actual problem solving process to adress patent abuses, all to no avail. Wikipedia is in fact evil, and it deserves to fail as an encylopedia unless it can
solve its problems. Unless wikipedia can figure out how to not be a mob groupthink social experiment where any idiot, fool, con artist,
or propagandist can assume equal footing with knowledge and fact,
Wikipedia is just a big fat doomed social experiment, which will die
because enough people will recognize that it is in fact evil, and go
do better and more important things with their time, like start A REAL online Encylopedia that includes logic and knowledge and truth and basic criteria for defining abuse and basic methodlogies for dealing with it.

I think there are passages in Proudhon that read like minarchism. But there are just as many others if not more that don't. Whatever Larry Gambone says (I see that's where you've been taking your Proudhon quotes from, which is I guess why you never give decent references), there is certainly inconsistency - or at least, a greater degree of complexity than I think you are willing or able to accept, in Proudhon's work. But then who isn't inconsistent? As I said, it's not hard to find quotes in Proudhon that are against anarchism or that support property (in the full-blown sense). That doesn't mean that he was never an anarchist. 

I think 'On the general idea of the revolution in the 19th century' has his fullest discussion of the state and of his version of an anarchist society. It's definitely worth reading, and is widely available in english (though unfortunately I don't think it's on the net). 

In Section IV (On the principle of authority) you can find for example:

""""We conclude without fear that the revolutionary formula should not be direct legislation, nor direct government, nor simplified government; it is no more government.""""

""""Neither monarchy, nor aristocracy, nor even democracy, where this third term implies some or other government acting in the name of the people and calling itself the people. No authority, no government, even of the people: there is the revolution.""""

And there's plenty more in that vein.

 Neo-Nazis on Wikipedia  

With so much information online, there is a big need for encyclopedias. Wikipedia is not the answer.  Wikipedia has writers and administrators who squash the truth.   They are anti libertarian and they glorify totalitarianism with their Nazi-style behavior.  Wikipedia’s lies are so infamous that it has inspired a nationwide boycott, especially for the apparent Neo-Nazism of some of its more rabid writers.  

Wikipedia writers prevent any mention of the new historical discovery that the USA was the source of the Nazi salute. The USA's first Pledge used a straight-arm salute and it was the origin of the salute of the monstrous National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis), as shown by Dr. Rex Curry.  It was not an ancient Roman salute. Professor Curry helped to establish that it was not an ancient Roman salute, and that the """"ancient Roman salute"""" is a myth. A image search on the web for the “original pledge of allegiance” provides additional information.

The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched out toward the flag. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute is an extended military salute. Additional information is available in web searches for the text """"military salute became the Nazi salute.""""

Francis Bellamy (author of the """"Pledge of Allegiance"""") and Edward Bellamy (author of the novel """"Looking Backward"""") and Charles Bellamy (author of """"A Moment of Madness"""") were socialists.  Edward and Charles were brothers, and Francis was their cousin. Francis and Edward were both self-proclaimed National Socialists and they supported the """"Nationalism"""" movement in the USA, the """"Nationalist"""" magazine, the """"Nationalist Educational Association,"""" and their dogma of """"military socialism,"""" and Edward inspired the """"Nationalist Party"""" (in the USA) and their dogma influenced socialists in Germany, and the Pledge was the origin of the Nazi salute. """"Nazi"""" means """"National Socialist German Workers' Party."""" A mnemonic device is the swastika. Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, Professor Curry discovered that it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent """"S"""" letters for their """"socialism.""""  Hitler altered his own signature to use the same stylized """"S"""" letter for """"socialist"""" and similar alphabetic symbolism still shows on Volkswagens. """"  Additional information is available in image or text searches for “swastika secrets.” 

Dr. Curry showed that many modern myths about swastikas are based on the false belief that Nazis called their symbol a """"swastika.""""  German National Socialists did not use the word """"swastika,"""" but called their symbol a """"Hakenkreuz.""""  

Recently, one Wikipedia writer became wiser and improved the """"Roman salute"""" article somewhat so that it recognizes and repeats some of Rex Curry's discoveries. Other pledge and salute articles on Wikipedia are as bad as ever.

The Wikipedia article for the """"Roman salute"""" used to be complete disinformation, deliberately maintained by phonies who tried to perpetuate myths. Here is an excerpt of what Wikipedia used to carry: """"The Roman salute is a closed finger, flat-palm-down hand raised at an angle (usually 45 degrees) and was used by the Roman Republic. It was also the historical civilian salute of the United States, from 1787?-1934?, known since 1892 as the Bellamy salute. It was also the historical salute among armies of the Middle East and South America."""" Wikipedia liars also used the painting """"The Oath of the Horatii"""" as absurd support for a Roman connection. The foregoing is all incorrect and of course without any attribution nor support on the Wikipedia page because there is no support. It is not a Roman salute.  Yet, Wikipedia regulars allowed the disinformation, including the dates “1787?-1934?” with the question marks included, to remain posted on Wikipedia, while deleting anyone who tried to correct the propaganda.

Similar criticisms apply to the Wikipedia pages on Francis Bellamy, Edward Bellamy and the Pledge of Allegiance.

Wikipedia falsifiers use the misnomer """"public schools"""" when they mean """"government schools"""" and they both cover-up the Bellamys' desire to promote a government takeover of education, a desire to end all of the better alternatives, and to impose socialism (and what the Bellamys called """"military socialism"""") within government schools. The Bellamys loved the military and wanted all of society to ape the military. Those points also help explain why Francis Bellamy enjoyed starting the pledge with a military salute.

Some regular writers on Wikipedia knowingly engage in personal attacks and deletions (even of links) of anyone who explains the connection between Edward Bellamy and his cousin Francis Bellamy (author of the pledge of",0.0

Track and Field
The sport of Track and Field does not have the same kind of dividing line as other """"Professional"""" sports.  It was only in the 1970's that elite athletes started to get paid for their performances.  Olympic medalists Bob Richards and Bruce Jenner cashed in after their competitive days by product endorsements.  Some senior athletes have managed to attain sponsorships simply for wearing a brand while competing.  Masters athletics is the division of the sport where athletes compete into, as mentioned, their hundreds.  I edited the separate section for Field Events out of this list, though if you wish to limit the Track and Field section to runners, there are documented cases of runners at age 101 or 102.

 Military history WikiProject Newsletter, Issue I 

 The Military history WikiProject Newsletter Issue I - March 2006  Project news
 An independent military history peer review has been created for the benefit of the project.  A number of articles have already been reviewed, receiving significantly more feedback within the project than they did on the generic peer review page.
 The project's Collaboration of the Fortnight got off to a great start with Ferdinand Foch and is now focusing on the military history of Spain.
 Two new task forces—dealing with warfare during classical antiquity and the Middle Ages—have been created.
 An effort to build a catalogue of high-quality maps for use in military history articles is now underway.
 The newly-formed translation department is looking for volunteers to help with translating featured articles from other-language Wikipedias. From the Coordinators
Welcome to the inaugural issue of the Military history WikiProject's newsletter!  We hope that this new format will help members—especially those who may be unable to keep up with some of the rapid developments that tend to occur—find new groups and programs within the project that they may wish to participate in.  

Please consider this inital issue to be a prototype; as always, any comments and suggestions are quite welcome, and will help us improve the newsletter in the coming months.

, Lead Coordinator Current proposals
 Proposed guidelines for categories of military people are currently being discussed.  A number of issues have already been resolved, but the proposed scheme is still in draft form and further input would be very welcome.

"""{{unblock | I am appealing a 48-hour block that was placed on me before I could post my response via the administrator's message board. I apologize in advance for the length of this but I believe that it's necessary to include all of these details. I wrote a summary at the end so that administrator's could get an overview if they don't have time to read the whole statement.

I will be addressing the claim that I violated the 1RR rule in the second paragraph of this article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitzhak_Shapira

According to WP:BLP, """"Biographies of living persons  must be written conservatively and with regard to a subject's privacy..."""" 
In a book written in a foreign language, with a lot of jargon, there are often competing translations/interpretations. And a book written in such a hotspot is sure to generate numerous quotes, misquotes, dubious translation and out-of-context statements. As per WP:BLP I think it stands to reason that a more conservative and less sensationalist translation be used, and for the same reason, the quotes should not be taken out of the context that the book uses them in.

With than in mind on the 18th of February, I improved certain parts of the paragraph in question in order to make to make it more compatible with WP:BLP based on this source.

user:Zero0000 -  responded to one of my edits by stating that [en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yitzchak_Ginsburgh&diff;=538816167&oldid;=538810305 I """"can't read.""""] And in what seemed to be extremely inappropriate comment for a Wikipedia administrator, told me in as many words to get off Wikipedia.""""Take a break"""" I didn't take nicely to being told that by an administrator and thus began a heated series of exchanges during which I was told by said individual that I had """"behavioral problems.""""
Said individual also decided to respond to my comments by invoking what seemed to me to intimidation tactics """"I started to write a complaint against you"""" (why do I need to know that? He can let me know when he posts it) and then later responding to another edit he didn't like by saying that """"it was on my charge sheet.""""

Now the reason I am writing about the behavior of said individual is to give some context or the 1RR issue:
After posting my version of the paragraph, user:Zero0000 subsequently changed it to this.

I will post only the first few words of his statement and the source:

Source: """"There is a reason to kill babies [on the enemy side""""]

user:Zero0000: [""""Babies [on the enemy side may be killed .""""]

After those first few words, user:Zero0000 continues quoting the rest of the paragraph. Now at best this is a serious distortion. 

And when you consider that article is dealing with a scholarly work which contains hundreds of sometimes competing, sometimes contradictory sources, rationales, theories, proposals, and ideas; many of which are subsequently discounted, limited in scope, or just tossed by the wayside, the disparity the statement """"may be done"""" and """"there is a reason"""" is even greater.

Aside from the distortion mentioned above, in contradiction to WP:BLP user:Zero0000 also opted for a particularly liberal out-of-context translation.

Why did user:Zero0000 replace my edit with his own. His statement:
(prefer source with an actual quotation)

As I showed above, he didn't use an actual quotation.

Furthermore, after seeing his comment, I searched but wasn't able to find any Wikipedia reference to a such a preference, leading me to believe that he was intent on just superimposing his own WP:JUSTDONTLIKEIT on me without explanation. 

His actions above combined with the general hostility cited above led me to be believe that this was another front in the multi-pronged campaign of intimidation that he was engaging in (i.e. encouraging me """"take a break"""").NEWLIN",0.0

 Writer attribution for Lennon/McCartney songs 

Your edit comments that """"Authorship of Beatles's songs is difficult to ascertain precisely, except for the rule that the lead singer is the dominant writer"""" and """"Authorship of Beatles's songs is difficult to ascertain precisely, since all four, plus George Martin and others, were frequently involved in the crafting"""" are wrong on several counts.

 The official, legal credits are easy to determine: Lennon/McCartney except for some early songs which were originally credited to McCartney/Lennon. Ample sources exist and the WP infoboxes show the official L/M (or M/L) credit.
 Who actually wrote the song is pretty easy to determine for most of the songs where there is no dispute between L and M. Using various interviews and biographies as sources, L and M say what their part was. For a small minority of songs, such as """"Eleanor Rigby"""", L and M disagreed and the article describes the disputed authorship. For cases where there was a 60/40 split, adverbs like """"predominantly"""" or """"mainly"""" make sense, but not in cases where there is no dispute that L or M was the sole author.
 While it is true that the lead singer was often the main writer of an L/M song, it is not always true. """"Every Little Thing"""" is one such exception.
 Other people who contribute to a song—such as a producer or soloist—typically do not get a writing credit for their contribution. That's standard practice in the industry with rare exceptions, and there are good reasons for it. When someone makes a significant contribution, that should be discussed in the prose or in the Personnel section, i.e., """"Martin wrote the string arrangement"""" or whatever.

Your position on the L/M situation is a minority viewpoint. The authorship details you are challenging are typical of hundreds of articles that have similar prose and use similar evidence and the text in those articles have been accepted by many WP editors. That represents a strong consensus for identifying the actual author in the prose. You should seek consensus for your changes and present reliable sources that support your view. —   """,0.0

 Jorge Gracie 
The article was deleted via a 3-2 vote.  This isn't a consensus but rather a small majority. I have seen quite often when a 3-2 vote did not result in deletion but the talk of no consensus reached.   Additionally, many individuals in the articles for deletion noted Jorge via MMAnote rather than MAnote .   At worst, I would like to have this article userfied.  Thank you.    
Rough Consensus on wikipedia is about balancing arguments against consensus not policy. So on one hand we had keep votes arguing against an inherent notability that didn't have a policy background and a delete side that was arguing that the subject did not meet the GNG/inclusion guideline because the sources were inadequate. The sources brought up in the discussion did not seem to meet the GNG so I was left with policy based arguments to delete and non-policy based arguments to keep. That gives a rough consensus to delete. I'm always happy to userfy. Where would you like it.  Humbug! 
Fully disclosing my biases toward keep on this issue, I agree with  that you made an erroneous decision on this one. I'm no admin, but the debate appears fully in the midst of no consensus, which as you well know, in deletion discussions, normally results in the article, page, image, or other content being kept. I find it confusing that you would say that the keep votes didn't have a specific policy foundation in mind when I specifically and intentionally addressed WP:BASIC as the guildeline (particularly because this was a bio) and then listed a recently published book, black belt magazine, and (least but not irreverently so) the BJJ heroes biography as sources which achieve this guideline. If, for whatever reason, you find the more prime WP:GNG to be the true standard of retention for this article, well I see no reason why it does not equivalently square with nor meet the standards set forth in WP:BASIC. I say this in due respect sir.   
I'm a bit confused BASIC is a simplification of the GNG, Please can you explain which sources are suitable to determine notability in this case? Thanks,.   Humbug! 
Good sir, I'm a bit flummoxed as to what it is about the glut of sources that ISN'T particularly suitable for you. Is it the """"Significant coverage"""" or some other such sub-section of the GNG specifically? I believe that this source would have more than met that.

Most critically is the section: """"If the depth of coverage in any given source is not substantial (as many of these sources admittedly were not), then multiple independent sources may be combined to demonstrate notability, which the at least dozen or so sources DID in a non-trivial manner. Now I know I'm not a administrator, and I don't have the permissions nor presumably knowledge to adjudicate these affairs, but I do casually work on more than enough bios to know that when the majority of all biographies (take this as an example) are FAR less cited and left kept or otherwise unmolested clearly there is a double standard in effect here.   
I have reviewed the sources. Have you read the guideline on reliable sourcing The only reliable source in the deleted article was the book reference and that was roughly 100 words. That and fan sites does not a wikipedia biography make. Also see Other stuff exists.  Humbug!

John Peel
Thanks Wikiklrsc, I had forgotten that he'd phoned in an article to the Liverpool Echo, though at the time he had pretended to be a reporter.
On the 1st Marriage I don't know why you've modified my edit on that as it is accurate (source: Peel's autobiography & a few websites). You say the modification was """"due to being unclear on the motivation of prior edits by """"AllanHainey"""""""" - my motivation is to have a full & complete wikipedia entry. I will check Peels autobiography tonight for more details & re-add info on this, as a 1st marriage (especially to a 15 year old) is a significant part of his life & should be included. If you've got any objection or reason not to include this we can discuss it on the talk page.
Thanks for confirming the computer programmer bit - I hadn't seen any reference to it on the web or autobiography so I assumed it was false.

Julien, there always exist contrary points of view. People still take issue with the Earth being round. But while one can have a contrary opinion, that doesn't make said opinion a fact. 

Gaywebmonkey has cited its sources  an interview with Corrigan, published comments by Cobra's attorney's, email correspondence between Corrigan and an unnamed producer, and statements by various anti-child porn groups.  The issue isn't those sources. It's the fact that you haven't provided one source for anything you've contributed to the article. 

I've changed your """"claiming"""" comments  to """"stating."""" """"Claiming"""" is far less neutral than """"stating."""" You are arguing the article was biased. I was rectifying that situation. None of which prohibits another party with knowledge of the issues in question from stating the opposite  as Cobra's attorneys have done.  But just changing """"stated"""" to """"claims"""" doesn't make something """"more"""" neutral.

Lastly, the reason why citation is so important here is to allow anyone else to backtrack and read for themselves about the issues in question. It brings a measure more of impartiality to the proceedings. The rules here are the same for you as they are for me: cite your sources.

FYI
Here is the content of the Monoplane article from Britannica.  It's not an initial.
Monoplane,  type of aircraft with a single pair of wings. The monoplane design has been nearly universally adopted over multiplane configurations because airflow interference between adjacent wings reduces efficiency. The first monoplane was constructed by the Romanian inventor Trajan Vuia, who made a flight of 12 m (40 feet) on March 18, 1906. Louis Blériot of France built a monoplane in 1907 and flew it across the English Channel two years later. Monoplane design proved itself conclusively during World War II, and since then the craft has completely supplanted the biplane except for special purposes. Compare biplane  Best regards.

Notability of James Henry Benson
A tag has been placed on James Henry Benson, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

The terms of reference (open to the public to see) for the Community Rep meetings state that all questions will be answered within a time frame yet TfNSW are refusing to do this.

 Completion date

The new reference is now to the main page at http://burjdubaiskyscraper.com which does indeed say 30 June '09.  My question is: can burjdubaiskyscraper.com be considered a reliable source?

I think we should change the completion to 2009, but not include an exact date.  Since burjdubaiskyscraper.com is just a third-party site, I do not think they can be trusted with knowing the official information.  But, Emporis.com does have a completion date of 2009; they can be trusted.  Also, I do not know how anyone can know the exact date of the completion of a building.  It would be best to just stick to the year.   (talk | contributions) 

    

 Height in early March 2008 

Several editors have changed the height of the Burj Dubai from 604.9 m to 611.3 m.  I have changed it back to 604.9 metres as no official statment has yet been made by Emaar.  I propose that the height not be changed unless Emaar makes an official statement or there is a change of the height on the Burj Dubai's official site: www.burjdubai.com.  Since only the developer knows the exact height, we should not use any updates or information from other sources.  Once the height on the official website is updated should we change the height here on Wikipedia.   (talk | contributions) 
I agree.  One official source is better than many conflicting unofficial sources.    

 Remaining milestones 
I have my doubts whether the Petronius oil platform qualifies as a """"world's tallest freestanding structure"""" and as a milestone for Burj Dubai to pass.  Most of it's structure is below water and therefore doesn't qualify under CTBUH rules.    
I do not have an opinion on the issue, just a few comments.  Consensus is that it is not considered the tallest; and therefore may not warrant being included as a milestone.  But, despite that, it does stand taller than the CN Tower, even if it is in water.  It will not hurt if we keep it, and will not be a major deal if we take it away.  Let us see if anyone else has an opinion.   (talk | contributions) 

 At this rate, we gotta keep all those deep level mines too since they are much 'taller' than any tower or oil platform ever built.
  

Actually, many argue that the Petronius is the """"tallest free-standing structure"""", hence the usual addition of """"on land"""" to the Burj Dubai's title (for now), and previously to the CN Tower's title. So I don't agree that consensus agrees to the contrary; consensus agrees that it is not on land, but there is much support of it being a free-standing structure in general. CTBUH has never released any information about the world's tallest structures; it only measures the height of the tallest buildings, so by its rules the CN Tower also would not count. It is therefore not very relevant in this situation. Anyway, I believe that the Petronius should be kept as a milestone. Cheers, -me 

Would Petronius stand on it's own without buoyancy?   
 Even if it can, a lot of the difficulty of a tall structure is in the construction process.  Oil rigs have a serious advantage there because they don't need tall cranes, because you can access the top with boats.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 32.97.110.142

 2011 British GP team orders 

Before this turns into an edit conflict, what needs to be considered is that stating 'Vettel finished second after ...team orders...' incorrectly implies that he finished second because of those team orders. Since Webber himself admits that he ignored the team orders and still tried to overtake Vettel, IF it needs to be included, it needs to be reworded:

 The True Founding of the Dominion of Canada

The titles need not show that the characters are related, all about this is in the articles. You see, the nature of fiction is that it's not necessarily coherent. Since this article is not about Malcolm Wilkerson in the first episode of the show """"Malcolm in the Middle"""" but about the character throughout the show, it is indeed inaccurate to use a name for the character that was only used for the pilot episode. For the entire rest of the seven season run, the character's name was only """"Malcolm"""". This is not a question of beauty or taste, but of plain accuracy. A title like """"Malcolm (XXX)"""" my appear clumsy, but Wilkerson is not an alternative. In my opinion. If can't build consensus on this between the two of us, I suggest asking for additional input at Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions, since I didn't find anything in the guidelines for a specific case like this (although I'm fairly sure the fact that the character's name was """"Wilkerson"""" only during the first of 151 episodes of the show means that calling the character """"Wilkerson"""", esp. in the title, is inaccurate). —'''''' """,0.0

No policy requires inline citations. They are often a good idea, and are a requirement for feature article status, but it is not a requirement for all articles. Furthermore, the tag is often used when the article has adequate sources. This tag therefore enshrines a particular editor's view about style (that the article in question should have inline citations) in an inappropriate way. That point belongs on the talk page, not in the article itself. Robert A.West (Talk) 

    Where does it say that featured articles have different requirements then other articles? Jeepday 

        The whole point in to get citations for all articles so that they meet the WP:V requirements, I have noticed that tags quite often help by bringing this to attention of users, particularly new-ish users. Cheers SeanMack

Anglo Americans are not """"racially deranged"""" as you put it. Italians are accepted as white in the United States, as are Greeks, Jews, Spaniards, etc...

"Another issue / suggestion 

I noticed another issue that I guess it's not listed anywhere: when some articles start getting big and full of information, wikipedia users refrain from deleting weak or even nonsense parts. They believe it's good to keep all that (useless?) stuff, probably reasoning that some information is better than none. That's why many many articles get huge and are tagged to need the attention of an expert (who would hopefully clean up all the junk).

I strongly disagree with this behavior of keeping junk on the main page. I guess the editing system should allow two versions of an article: the main one, with the information that was agreed by everyone (intersection of information) and another, longer one with all the possible information for that subject (union of information). In this way people would not be so afraid of deleting junk because it would be stored on the second page, and the main article would always be a cleaned up version, which, if not complete, at least would not fail on quality.",0.0

 My block/unblock 

On the current arb case, there is a proposed decision dealing with myself at Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Eastern_European_mailing_list/Proposed_decision#Russavia. It appears that several arbs have asked for another proposal to be put forward, which I have done at Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Eastern_European_mailing_list/Workshop#Editing_restrictions_proposal; I don't know if they are aware of this proposal or not. I have another issue, that being my indef block which was put on myself for a perceived legal threat. This has been mentioned at Wikipedia_talk:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Eastern_European_mailing_list/Proposed_decision#On_Russavia, and it has also been mentioned there and on the proposed decision case page, that WP:NLT should be dealt with as per that policy. I have dealt with on the PD talk page, and also on my talk page at User_talk:Russavia#Alleged_legal_threats_issued_by_myself_and_unblock_request, as per WP:NLT. It should be mentioned that my indef block was not as a result of any arbcom enforcement, nor as a result of a community supported ban, but as a result of the perceived legal threat. The indef ban was lifted so that I could participate in the Arbcom proceedings, but at that stage WP:NLT had not been dealt with to the satisfication of the blocking admin.? Anyway, I would like to seek some clarification from you at the clerk for this case, as to what I would need to do in order to have the indef block """"officially"""" lifted, so to speak, so that I can return to editing within the confines of the topic ban handed down by Sandstein. Your advice is appreciated.  Dialogue 
Given the Committee didn't pass that temporary injunction, I'd suggest that you are still under the restrictions set down as part of the unblock-to-participate-in-the-RfAr. When the case closes, I expect the Committee will deal with your blocking/unblocking in some way in the final decision; depending on what the final decision is in this regard (there are an infinite number of possibilities), you/we can re-evaluate the best course of action at that point. 
The only way to have the conditions on the unblock lifted before the final decision would be to appeal to the Community and get consensus to overturn the block; I doubt that this would be successful given the parallel arbitration proceedings, as most Wikipedians will likely say """"just see what ArbCom decides then play it from there"""".
My $0.02. Regards,   
Thanks for your reply Daniel, its appreciated. As you can understand I am in a state of purgatory at the moment, not really knowing what may come, and whether the committee will indeed address this, as several arbs have already stated their opinion that cases of WP:NLT should be addressed by the community. Given that WP:DIGWUREN took some 3 months to reach a conclusion, and other cases can take longer, I would hate for this case to take that long only for committee to turn my indef block back to the community. As I am a content creation driven editor, you can probably understand that this is less like purgatory, and more like hell. Do you think it may be possible to seek clarification from the Committee if the issue of my indef block for WP:NLT will be dealt with by them, or not? If not, I would expect this would free me up to take the issue to the community via an avenue such as WP:AN in order to allow me to continue editing, under the confines of the topic ban imposed by another admin, with that perhaps being addressed by Arbcom (the topic ban). Sorry for being a pain in the arse, but hopefully you understand my predicament and hence why I think it would need clarification from the Committee, as to whether it will or won't be addressed. As you are the clerk, might you be so kind as to seek clarification for me, if you don't mind of course. Also, my apologies for bringing this to your talk page, as I am totally new to Arbcom proceedings (hoping this will be my one and only involvement in one), I am somewhat bamboozled at to where to ask for clarification on the case pages; it is a dog's breakfast that is for sure.  Dialogue 
Not at all, no need to apologise. I will certainly pursue a line of inquisition with the Committee about what they recommend you do and what their intended course of action is on the issue; if you haven't heard back from me by Monday please ping me again (the weekend is normally rather busy for me, so if it's not sorted and I haven't got an answer from the relevant Committee members by then, I'll probably be unable to progress the issue though Friday night/Saturday/Sunday",0.0

"Hey, kicking the hornets nest happens, no fault of your own.  Let me just give you fair warning though, that the editor who initiated the move request has a long involvement in this, and all those folks that are supporting this move along side you are the native German speakers who were adamant against any form of compromise.  A bit weird they all show up within a couple days, isn't it?  LOL  The editor who made this move request regularly communicates offsite through e-mail, hence my suspicions.  Anyway, you'd think people could compromise, wouldn't you?  I guess history tells us that some humans are not capable of compromise...  So, anyway, as far as your research, and I'm not sure where you are based, but if you are in the United States, try dropping by a Whole Foods, etc.. and you'll see that products from this region are labeled as coming from Alto Adige.   This is a marketing decision made by inhabitants of this province.  Look, I'll be the first to agree that both South Tyrol and Alto Adige are used in English,  it is really about 50/50 (especially in the UK).  In the US it is almost completely Alto Adige (because our interaction with Bolzano is mostly thru agriculture).  Here are some examples of Alto Adige being used  and .  Yes, the German speakers can make similar arguments for South Tyrol usage, and we can go on and on and on.  That is why the original compromise was made, to use Alto Adige and South Tyrol in the lead paragraph, and use the Province of X location (as is done for every other province of Italy on Wikipedia) for the article.  But, some German speaking editors could never accept this, and want this article to match the German Wikipedia article, Sudtirol.  Ever wonder why they constantly remove Alto Adige from bold face and any statement recognizing its use in English?  Anyway, I really hate to even participate in this nonsense anymore, but this move request is nothing less than abuse of Wikipedia (but, hey, what's new).  The same old editors are trying to come in here and flood the voting to change what was a decision made thru many weeks and months of discussions, and to a naming convention that is clearly biased towards a German point of view.

"Question about guardian angels
According to the wiki article on demonology, there are 133,306,668 demons and the bible says
1/3 of the angels fell from heaven and became demons.  Therefore, this would mean that there
are 266,613,336 good angels (i.e. 133,306,668 + 266,613,336 = 399,920,004 total good and bad
angels with the bad angels being 1/3 of 399,920,004)

Given that there are about 6 billion people on the earth currently, this would mean that
a guardian angel would have to have more than one person he/she/it is responsible for.
I assume that God would not assign someone a demon to be his/her guardian angel, so this
makes the number of possible guardian angels at maximum, 266,613,336.  Since the world
population is now 6,542,502,827 this would mean that each guardian angel would have to
be assigned 24 to 25 people.

Does the above really sound reasonable to you guys?

Also, what did those 266 million guardian angels do when there was less than 266 million
people on the earth? (The world population reached 266 million around the year 1000 or so)",0.0

As I said, I simply reworded as best I could what was already there.

"I don't think it's equivalent to the sieve of eratosthenes (even when the optimization of using only odds is used).
Here is what Sieve of Sundaram looks like (where we loop at a = 2i + 1 and b = 2j + 1 instead of i and j):
n ← 1000000 // limit

// initialize the sieve
is_prime(2) ← true
is_prime(i) ← [i is odd], ∀ i ∈ [3, n]

for all odd a such that 3 ≤ a and a² ≤ n:
    for all odd b such that a ≤ b and ab ≤ n:
        is_prime(ab) ← false

while Sieve of Eratosthenes (using only odd integers) roughly looks like this (only one line is added):
n ← 1000000 // limit

// initialize the sieve
is_prime(2) ← true
is_prime(i) ← [i is odd], ∀ i ∈ [3, n]

for all odd a such that 3 ≤ a and a² ≤ n:
    if not is_prime(a): continue      // only this has changed
    for all odd b such that a ≤ b and ab ≤ n:
        is_prime(ab) ← false

This also shows that the Sieve of Sundaram is less efficient than the Sieve of Eratosthenes, and that its complexity is Θ(n log n) (since 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + ... + 1/n grows asymptotically as log n) compared to sieve of eratosthenes' Θ(n log log n) (since 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/5 + 1/7 + ... + 1/p grows asymptotically as log log n).",0.0
"""

Well-explained, but I would like to add: the lower field is clearly labeled """"alternate cover"""". The definition of alternate, as used here, is """"a substitute; an alternative; one designated to take the place of another"""". The group shot cover was designed specifically to replace the original, controversial cover, as the referenced commentary in the article clearly describes. This makes the group shot unquestionably the alternate cover, even if it is more common/recent. The same goes for albums like Light a Fire and Yesterday and Today. So no matter whether we can assert/prove which version is more common, it is blatantly obvious which cover is the """"alternate"""". Indeed, the controversy caused by the original cover, and the subsequent switch to the alternate, is the entire subject of the article's commentary. How there is even a question of which image belongs in which field is absolutely boggling to me.   """,0.0

""": I found three other sources that use the term. Two provide minor coverage (though one is about a specific language, Malbolge), while one provides significant coverage of the topic:

  Just a brief one-line usage of the term to describe Malbolge: """"Malbolge is known as one of the most esoteric programming languages. In this paper, we prove that Malbolge is weakly Turing complete.""""

  Just a brief one-line usage of the term in the references, citing this article: """"The following URL has some links to the different Esoteric Programming Languages: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language""""

  Discusses the topic at length. Largely verbatim excerpts from a 2005 conference paper co-authored by Mateas. Favors the term """"weird language"""" but says """"esoteric"""" is more commonly used.

 I think Mateas and Cox are enough to establish notability of the subject. As far as I can tell, the term as it's used here was invented by editor 163.1.103.122 in this article in 2002, and expanded in scope later that day by editor 213.253.40.113 (the definition has been stable since then). The term may have been taken out of context from an earlier website called """"Esoteric Topics in Computer Programming""""; that site used """"Esoteric Programming Languages"""" as a section name about a much broader set of languages, seeming to use """"esoteric"""" as an adjective like """"unusual"""" rather than as part of a specific term. None of this is from a reliable source, it's original research and not suitable for inclusion in the article, but it may be useful for others trying to find information on the subject.

"Your recent edits 

Your recent moves/edits to articles/categories/templates etc. can be commended per WP:BOLD - but unfortunately they are controversial and undiscussed. The correct venue is WP:RM, WP:CFD and WT:TFD - these moves need consensus behind them. If you continue to make such moves - especially ones to incorrect titles! - without that consensus then your actions could be deemed disruptive and may result in you being blocked from editing. Snowman 

Hi. GS, I think you are being completely mislead and do not have the facts in hand.  I have been following the proper avenues and have been meticulously improving the information that had remained incoherent prior to my immense contributions.  Absolutely I should be commended for it - not that I need, request, or desire commendation.
If you take your time, and really sit down to look through the entire history logs of both myself and what the Category:Fort Lauderdale Strikers page looked like, you would see that there was an entire mess.  Everything was disorganized.  I would gladly have a conversation with you in reference to the methodology used to place the information in order.  It is now in a suitable form that is representative of a Wikipedia index.
From the onset of my entrance to the Wikipedia team, I have been a contributor for the site who has only been bringing more insight by expanding articles or creating new ones.  You really should look into my entire contributions before pointing fingers.  This is not right and is counterproductive towards Wikipedians who are here to do good.
I have recently been putting in countless hours of tedious work towards improving the history of the Fort Lauderdale Strikeres and have placed very useful information.  The person above who is making the dispute and has come here making requests for your assistance has not made any significant contributions to the history of the team, other than fixing a title that was hyphenated on a couple of articles.  If anything, this person should be speaking with me as I am the one who has the proper knowledge of the subject in question and have been making consistent improvements to the relevant articles.  Furthermore, you should be speaking to this individual instead as he/she is the one who is editing without proper consultation to users who have been contributing significantly.
I ask that you seriously do some research on my history from day one to now, and put into proper context the positive value of my participation in Wikipedia.  Thank you.",0.0

 My Two Cents 

 Political correctness will be the end of our world as we know it. This is sad that political correctness has come to this level. It is causing our society to reward failure and condone criminal behavior. This is sad. We might as well change the constitution and exclude freedom of speech. This is next. Truly sad. Truly sad, indeed. 

 Also, regardless what you want to refer to the chinese as, china is the reason why the US's economy is in the crapper, and why our unemployment rate is higher than it has been since the early 1980's. We have made """"those people"""" rich while our economic infrastructure is crumbling. Open your eyes!

And for those reasons, I despise China as well as the politically correct.

 Niggardly 
It is apparent by reading wiki's page on the """"controversial"""" word """"niggardly"""", that stupid people and words do not mix. It has been said that most people never pick up a book after leaving high school. Proof of this exists in the fact that this word can be taken so blatantly out of definition, that persons are asking that it be banned from the English language. As I said, idiots and words can be a dangerous combination.

What is even sadder is that I expressed this comment on wiki's niggardly page, and was accused of vandalism, yet others posted similar comments.

However, he certainly wasn't the producer of that one, at least according to (what appears to me to be) their website here.

 First point - it was not only treated as mental illness, but as criminal activity.
 Second point - you should only refer to 'homosexual romance' in the lead if there is a section that deals with 'homosexual romance' in the body of the text, as the lead is a summary of what is in the body, and having ten sources does not count for much unless the terms are unpacked somewhere in the main text.  All these seem to show is that people like Giddens (who is a notable sociologist, but no authority on sexuality, sexology,  LGBT studies in general or homosexuality in particular) use the term.  If there were a link to an article Homosexual romance, which shows the term can be taken for granted, fine - otherwise it needs to be dealt with in the article before it can be inserted into the lead. 
 Third point, my earlier comment about this was made with ironic and humorous intent, because I have only come across the term 'romance' used in this context, at conferences, ironically or critically.  Just because a term is used in sources does not mean that it can be used in the lead when it is not in the text, for example, """"Homosexuals deserve to be executed or tortured""""   """,0.14285714285714285

(outdent) How about looking at it like this. RPG rulebooks are just that. The rulebook explains how to play the game, but it is not the game itself. The ISBN manual you reference below supports this; games """"SHALL NOT"""" be given ISBNs. There may be some confusion in the matter, but one good example is found by harking back to AD&D; 2nd Ed. To play that game required (it being rules heavy, that really is pretty much true) a minimum of two books—the DM Guide and the Players' Handbook. Neither """"contained"""" the game, and the game went far beyond what was in either. The game in all its entirety encompassed the contents of many books, magazine articles, supplements, pamphlets, online articles and what was in the head of the players. The book is about the game; it is not the game.  

For that matter, a number of the articles you tagged did not list an ISBN, so you can't really claim that you claimed it was a book in ignorance because of the ISBN. A publisher doesn't mean it's a book, as board games, computer games, and any number of things are published and have publishers.

 Inline translated refs 

Yes, your example on my talk page is a perfectly reasonable way to go about it.  You could also just provide the translations on the talk page, with a note that you're leaving them there in case anyone needs them.  You might consider including the original text as well as the translation.  After all, a few readers will understand Croatian.

As for using inline refs:  It's really fairly simple.  You just take the same text that you'd use for the regular citation, but instead of putting it at the end, under ==References==, you put it in the article, and put  before the footnote text, and  after it.  (What's confusing is trying to use the citation templates for inline refs, but those are strictly optional.)

If it's a ref that you expect to use repeatedly, then you name it:   (instead of just  at the beginning).  Then to re-use it, you only have to put    and the Wiki software will know that you want it to be the same number and citation text that you used earlier.  (Note the slash at the end.  Also, that's the whole thing for the subsequent uses:  there's no citation text after it and no  needed after it.)

Finally, if that sort of inline ref isn't your preference, then you might prefer what some people call """"Harvard style"""" references, or Author-date-page references.  For that, you skip all the  stuff, and just put plain text at the end of a statement like this:  

The moon is big (Smith 2008:25).

That means that you found this information in a publication written by someone whose last name is Smith, published in 2008, on page 25.  Then you put a regular alphabetized list of citations at the bottom of the page, and the reader just scans down to see who Smith is if the reader is interested.

Some Wikipedia editors have proposed that Wikipedia article content should be in proportion to article count. In other words, if there are 5 articles about Suburban Express about history, competitive battles, etc., and 20 """"articles"""" (blog posts, mostly) about the recent newsy trash that 80% of the article should relate to the recent newsy trash. One big problem with that is the fact that many of the blog articles are simply regurgitated from one seminal article or two. In other words, if there are 20 blog articles, there may be 18 that are essentially copied from the initial two. If the body count method of assigning weight is accepted, duplicate/regurgitated articles should probably be ignored.

This page was subjected to repeated vandalism in the nature of a hoax.
One or more of the children of Sonja de Lennart appear to have engaged in a lengthy hoax, beginning around December 2007, to convince the world that their mother was a famous designer in the 1940s and 1950s (although a Google search reveals no references in any fashion or other reputable sources until 2008), including vandalism of numerous Wikipedia articles (Emilio Pucci and Capri pants articles were vandalized).

Recent news articles on Capri pants have picked up the false information (the Wikipedia article on Capri pants has been duplicated on answers.com and other reference sites), and these are being used to further the hoax.  

The """"official website"""" of Sonja De Lennart was created by her daughter, Eleonora De Lennart, in February 2008, and was serving as the """"reputable source"""" for the claim that Sonja De Lennart created Capri pants (heretofore generally attributed to Emilio Pucci) until the news articles came up in June 2008.

Users Pchip and Delennart are the two Wikipedia IDs responsible for this hoax - user Delennart began repeatedly vandalizing the Emilio Pucci and Capri pants pages on December 30, 2007 to insert references to Sonja De Lennart as the creator of Capri pants, and after other Wikipedia users instructed her that the discussion of Sonja De Lennart was not appropriate on the Emilio Pucci page, user Delennart stopped contributing to Wikipedia and user Pchip suddenly appeared in February 2008 to further vandalize the Capri pants page and to create the hoax page for Sonja De Lennart.

 Adult-child sex & child sexual abuse 

Copied from WP:ANI ohio 

 I've asked this question before, but I've never had an understandable explanation:  How is the article a POV fork?  If it's been explained previously, just point me to the diff.  I've seen plenty of people say it's a POV fork, but what I see is a value-neutral etic approach to a topic that's as old as humanity itself.  Even if the title is POV, the content can be used in other articles, so why delete it? ohio 

 """"Adult-child sex"""" is a euphemism (for child sexual abuse), and any article titled """"Adult-child sex"""" is prima facie assumed to be apologistic for child sexual abuse. Exactly as if someone took an article """"Nazi genocide"""" and retitled (or made a fork) entitled """"Nazi demographic adjustments"""". We understand that you don't agree with this but if you still don't understand it then you had better look to yourself.   

 Exactly as Hero said. As a contemporary example, Ethnic Cleansing and Genocide. One is just a fancy name for the other.  •   •  • 03:41 (UTC)  6 Mar '08

I don't see the logic of that.  Adult-child sex (the term) goes no further than plain description.  I can see where some editors were trying to insert POV material about child sexual abuse into the article, but I don't see how it logically follows that the term itself becomes a euphemism for child sexual abuse.  The term itself can advance no agenda.  It is materially different from the genocide = demographic adjustments example, which may invoke Godwin's law.  As for VP's example, ethnic cleansing means something different from (but related to) genocide, just as adult-child sex does with child sexual abuse.  The repeated assertion has been made that the term itself is POV.  Where is the POV in it?  Since this seems not to be much of an AN/I question, I invite replies at my talk page. ohio """,0.14285714285714285

Administrator, I regret to inform you that from where I stand you sound like you have taken sides. In my eyes it undermines your position as an impartial arbiter and reflects upon your reputation. Overall in my view your handling of the matter has been so far lacklustre at best. You practically admitted that your decision to block me was made on impulse (you initially put a wrong reason as grounds for the block). It seems you are concentrated on watching me while turning a blind eye on how I am being treated. When one of the accusers calls me an 'unfortunate fella' and you choose to ignore it, am I correct to assume that I can also call my opponents 'unfortunate fellas' or you as a watchdog will block me for another 'personal attack'?  I think your last remark is absolutely unwarranted. """"Please stop telling people not to post here""""? I was not telling I was asking and very politely for that matter, as I do not want my talk page to be turned into an incoherent pile rather than than what Wikipedia creators intended it to be. I think your popping up like that and commenting a minor post of mine looks like another impulsive decision unworthy or an administrator, and also comes dangerously close to what may be interpreted as open bias and prejudice. I kindly ask to get off my back - you really need not be there, I am not such a loose cannon that scrutiny of every little post of mine would be justified. I perceive such excessively close 'guidance' as pressure, and I will act accordingly if I feel your actions contradict your status of an administrator. This is not a threat - it's a statement of my position and my intentions if such treatment continues.  """,0.0

I agree that Stevietheman's suggestion is the most appropriate to implement. JHP, if you're talking about the 14:54, 27 June 2007 24.209.30.113 (edit #141014976) entry that I reverted, it is because the content was taken directly from the Incidents page without any regard for either (a) including the references themselves, or (b) not following the WP:BLP policy that was taking place over on that page regarding this specific incident.  If you're talking about the 22:32, 2 July 2007 Realkyhick (edit #142152748) entry that I reverted, it's because the entry contained information that was already outdated by information that was updated in the Incidents page, and the link to the Incidents page was also removed by Realkyhick at that time.  If you're talking about your edit #147620955 from the 29th, that was just a copy of the same info from the Incidents page, poorly included, and badly placed in the article  while we all agree that there should be some mention of the incident, including it in the intro section isn't really appropriate either, especially as it (in essence) duplicated information that was posted further down the page.  Yes, I know that you'll disagree with the """"in essence"""" part, but go with me on the concept.

While Woolwich murder and Woolwich attack are both currently common in sources, I don't see how 'murder' helps anyone not familiar with the incident to recognise it. There were 99 murders in London last year, some of which either deserve or already have Wikipedia articles I would have thought. I doubt there's any that are about attacks in Woolwich in 2013. Bearing in mind that on Wikipedia, calling something an attack in a non-warzone in these times, basically means terrorism, and more often than not, will involve murder. To illustrate that - London attack is already a redirect to List of terrorist incidents in London which obviously has a link to this article, whereas London murder goes nowhere, and gives all sorts of random articles in the search results, none of which appear to be of any use to someone looking for this article. Similarly, Woolwich attack already redirects here, whereas Woolwich murder goes nowhere (although I'd have no objection to it coming here).",0.0

Hello Barto. I am curious as to what your motivation is in editing on the Ron Gostick page and are you the creator of it?  As stated on the talk page there, you are correct in stating that internet sources which are few come from mostly the extreme right or left.  These are terms both I and Ron, himself would acknowledge as being artificially misleading characterisations and could not be ascribed to him or the associates of the Canadian League of Rights. I could explain why here, but I won't bore you with the details.

However, I do reject the notion that everything must link to a Wiki article.  I am editing at another page, where there is no objection to verifiable external sourcesinternet or hard copy. I will not object to so-called Left or Right sources, as long as there are sources from external links to associations and people connected to Mr. Gostick.  The archives at the Australian League of Rights will have plenty of published materials on him, League objectives and views or anyone associated with him. This is one link that was removed in favor of David Lethbridge's document (hardly a non-politcally unbiased character considering he represents everything the opposite of what Gostick and the League of Rights stood for).

I will try to help you find sources, fair and credible in the near future, doing edits myself.  I just want to know if you have a bias of your own or are willing to be neutral on some claims made about him.  I know well what he and the League of Rights stand for, as I have been involved with it for near 30 yrs. There is no denying he was anti-totalitarianism and that includes anti-zionist, which automatically brings down the bogus smear of """"anti-semitism' and other such nonsense.  An editor should have at least some familiarity with the subject he is decidedly determined to write about.

I have notified Paul Fromm of the wiki page and link to him at Gostick's page, in case he didn't know it existed.  Be aware that Wikipedia has come under criticism for pages created on living persons, edited by vandals with damaging false claims unknown to the subject of the article until much later.  One was a recent high-level member of the Kennedy administration and believe me he made a public stink about it.  Living or dead, I don't care to see this happen to anyone.

Found it (capacity to conduct foreign relations). But it's not the """"problem"""" criteria for SoP - for SoP the problem criteria is the control of populated territory (e.g. ability of the SoP government to enforce SoP laws there). For example on p10/11 of the source: """"has a government...have a legislative body...have a judicary...have an executive, which carries out the laws and has at its disposal a considerable force responsive to its will."""" - in the case of SoP the territory it claims (regardless of undefined borders) is under Israel occupation/control. All other criteria are more or less satisfied - PLO-EC is SoP provisional government in exile, SoP has established diplomatic relations with many other states, SoP has diplomatic recognition by many other states, SoP accepts the membership obligations and has submitted membership application. The rest of the criteria depend on the judgment of UNSC and UNGA - whether SoP is """"peace loving"""", whether SoP is """"able and willing"""" to carry out the membership obligations. Even if it's deemed """"peace loving and willing to carry out the obligations"""" the """"problem"""" criteria is whether it's """"really a state"""" (because it doesn't have control over populated territory) and the related whether it's """"able to carry out the obligations"""" (because a state needs control over populated territory, otherwise it functions only in the diplomatic realm as a government-in-exile and doesn't have the ability to do anything on the ground). Of course, if the majority of all UNSC permanent members and 2/3rds of the UN members want - for political reasons - they can grant membership to a GiE (turn a blind eye to the lack of territorial control or resort to some reasoning that it's able to comply and only the foreign occupation prevents it, but that occupation is declared illegal by this and that UNSC and ICJ acts, so they won't take it into account, etc.)

 Response to the vandals (daughters of Sonja de Lennart) 

While Wikipedia administrator SWATJester is protecting you, your hoax has been thoroughly exposed.  Your mother was not a famous designer and did not create Capri pants.   

Your """"Professor Mueller"""" is a phony source.  He is neither a professor nor affiliated with the University of Zurich.  

Your only """"evidence"""" for your mother being a designer comes from the claims you made, on the website one of you created last year and owns, with completely unverifiable pictures.

Your insistence that Emilio Pucci would have been upset at Edith Head receiving an Oscar for his work makes no sense, except as an attempt to deceive readers.  The Academy Award for Best Costumes goes to a person chosen by the movie studio to create the wardrobes for the film.  Emilio Pucci was not creating costumes for a film, and would have had no reason to complain that someone else received an Oscar for what was not his effort.  Nor would Hubert de Givenchy have felt a need to give Emilio Pucci credit for the creation of Capri pants.  Emilio Pucci did no work on Sabrina.

You can't even keep your lies straight - in one post you claim that she was widely interviewed by fashion magazines and in another you claim that she did not know how to handle the international press.

Apparently, in your twisted mind, it was not prevalent in Europe to place information in books or magazines either.  

You have instigated a fraud, for the purpose of selling your books - claiming to be the daughters of a famous designer will get you appearances on TV and radio shows to hawk your books.  Since your publisher appears to be a vanity publishing house primarily devoted to the two of you, every bit of publicity must help.

{{unblock|That is absolutely false. I absolutely did not """"make a personal attack"""" on you. Dishonestly claiming a false pretext to block me is a reprehensible abuse of your authority. Since the stated reason for this one-week block is wholly spurious, absolutely false, I demand to be unblocked immediately.

Not only did I never make any """"personal attack"""" against you, admins will observe that I actually thanked and praised you for intervening, which I also did in my private email message to you. This pretext for a one week block is absolutely spurious. You're making a minor disagreement on a tangential point on the Talk page into something personal and abusing your authority.

As for your comments on the Talk page:

 I never accused you of making ad hominem arguments, I asked you to calm down  WP:DISENGAGE.

I was never not """"cool"""" to begin with, so it's unnecessary to tell me to """"calm down"""", """"cool down"""", etc. Moreover, you said to me: """"I see some efforts being made to try to work out the differences, they will not be worked out if you resolve to not negotiate and dig in your heels. Respectful discussion free of attacks is the best way to do this ..."""" This implies I had made """"attacks"""" on people in lieu of trying to negotiate a solution reasonably. But like I said, and as you seem to now acknowledge, I never employed any ad hominem arguments (i.e., """"attacks""""). Moreover, any administrator can go to the Talk page and see for themselves that I've gone to extraordinary lengths to negotiate a reasonable solution with other editors.

 You can be right about something and still be wrong  META:DBAD.

I don't know what it is you think I am """"right about"""" but still """"wrong"""" about. But you seem to be implying I'm being a """"dick"""". I challenge you to present any quotes from me evidencing your implication that I've been a """"dick"""", i.e. by making """"personal attacks"""". You'll find you are unable to do so.

 You have engaged in a level of rhetoric that has created a hostile atmosphere (WP:CIVIL), you refuse to relent from your positions and you attack the positions of others with walls of text and barbs (WP:DBF). You've had editors ask you to calm down and you've had admins ask you to calm down and yet you've attacked anyone who has asked you to  WP:NOTTHEM.

Again, this is a false characterization. Every response of mine to others arguments has been to address the facts and logic of their arguments, as I am doing here with you. I have in no way been uncivil either with you or the other editors engaged on the Talk page. I have discussed diverging views and made numerous concessions to others on the Talk page in order to come to a consensus. My replies to others on their positions have consisted of substantive responses on points of fact and logic, never """"personal attacks"""" or """"barbs"""" (""""walls of text"""" might apply, as I've gone to extraordinary length to outline my own views and to support my own arguments with facts and logic).

 # """"Unhelpful"""" is not a word.

Thanks for the correction. I'll reiterate: """"Kindly quote me where I ever employed any ad hominem arguments, as opposed to addressing the facts and logic of the argument(s) put forth. You'll find, Wgfinley, you're unable to do so. So kindly refrain from suggesting otherwise. It's not helpful. Cheers.""""

Incidentally, it is apparently this comment you here regard as a """"personal attack"""" against you. Any other admin can see for themselves I did not attack you here. On the contrary, I merely observed here that you had characterized ME as making """"attacks"""", when I had never done so. You're making this personal and abusing your authority.

 This is the first thing you posted immediately after your previous ban expired (WP:NAM) followed by open questioning of your ban even being valid, it appears you need more time to cool down, 7 days should do.

You have not substantively addressed even a single point in my argument why my previous ban was wrongful. Yet you block me further on an even more spurious pretext  this time an absolutely false allegation that I attacked you personally. Other admins can confirm I never once did so.

 If you come back from this block and engage in more vitriol here again I'll have no choice but to take further sanctions and ban you from editing or discussion on this article per WP:GS.

On your further mischaracterization of any of my remarks of mine as """"vitriol"""", see above.

I would request that whatever admin makes a decision on this that you please substantively address my points here. The stated reason for my being blocked for 1 week is that I made a """"personal attack"""" on Wgfinley. Admins will find that I have never once done so. This block is therefore inappropriate and an abuse of authority. As such,",0.0

"looking for information 

Hello. Does anyone know the name of the book or the author about a boy who was rescued from the moors in England by a man dressed up as a convicted criminal to go live with his great aunt who is in a wheel chair and only wears a wedding dress and in a locked room of the house sits a wedding cake-the whole room is set up for a wedding party but is covered in cob webs because it happened along time ago. Basically the aunt's wedding never happened. This book is centered around the 1800's in England. (I think) Any info leading me in the right direction would help, trying to find the book for a friend.

I have had trouble with this user before, in WP:ANI he named me as a Muslim fanatic (which I took out).

This article should not be speedily deleted for lack of asserted importance because...

A note should be made regarding timeliness. Specifically, should a list of referenced accomplishments be aged? Should an activity occurred more than one year or more ago? The lack of specificity creates ambiguity especially as it relates to other businesses, sites, people, etc. who would like to be included in wikipedia if for no other reason than posterity's sake.

This was deleted because of advertising, but to answer your questions, press releases are not useful to show notability as they are not independent references, but they could be used to support facts in a page if you believe them to be true.

 Project News
Two new WikiProjects have formed that relate to WP:Films. WikiProject Actors and Filmmakers has been started as a descendant of WP:Films and WP:BIO. The project will help to improve the quality of articles on actors, directors, screenwriters, producers, cinematographers, film editors, and film score composers. WikiProject James Bond also formed this month and will help to improve James Bond films, books, characters, and other related articles. The projects each currently have memberships of 20 users, and are seeking new members. Stop by both of these new projects and see if they interest you.
 We have now reached over 25,000 film articles that have been assessed by our assessment department! Remember to always add the {{Film|class=}} template to a film article's talk page so the project can get a better idea of what work still needs to be done. Below is a table showing a breakdown of our articles by class and importance.
Films without infoboxes have increased from about 2,000 to just over 5,000 films with systematic tagging completed this month. There are also tallies for requested film images (~7,000), articles that need synopsis (~4,100) and articles that need cast section (~400).
 Spotlight Update:  Multiple films and film-related articles have reached GA and FA status in April 2007.
 Fritz the Cat (4/28) Heavy Traffic (4/10)
 Shia LaBeouf (4/14)
 Leslie Nielsen (4/19)
 Battlefield Earth (4/19)
There were also two GA films that were recently delisted. Please help return the articles to their prior GA status.

"Calling someone a consistent hypocrite is a personal attack, pointing out a specific and relevant act of hypocrisy is not. Some of the same 'contributors' accusing the journal articles associated with Go! as being of insufficient note were the same voting to keep the Go article in the absence of any such third party mention beyond 'news'y blog mentions. That is hypocrisy. Pointing it out, however exasperatedly, is not a personal attack.",0.0

If world renowned academic publishers cannot be trusted for simple uncontentious facts then who can. We are not claiming that homeopathy is the one true medicine. We are simply claiming that there is a thing called homeopathy, and in homeopathy there is a treatment called Thuja which uses Thuja occidentalis in its preparation.

It's better than List of notable Hispanic Americans, because Hispanic Americans are also those from Hispanic America, and here, we are talking about """"Hispanics"""" in the US. In the article """"Hispanic Americans"""" also was done like this; it was moved to """"Hispanics in the United States"""", because otherwise it would cause conflict with the Hispanic Americans from Hispanic America.
