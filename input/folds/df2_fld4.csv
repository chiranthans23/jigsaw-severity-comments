">What does this even mean?

As I said... I'm not too sure. That's why I am discussing alimony. That is, a continuous payment from one party to the other. For other cases, it's very dependent.

Imagine a person who saved money for ten years to buy a house. The day before the buy, they marry. The buy has been done only through that person's hard work and saving, but as there was a 1day marriage, it is now owned by both? And if that second person decides to leave for no good reason, that person get half a cut? That hardly seems fair.

So as I said, the division of property is a tricky case that requires more subtelty, and I don't know.

But what about alimony?",0.4646680942184154

"""science"" is an idea and a process, nobody claims that science is a physically existing entity. Science does not exist, it happens.

As for God, your own definition is: ""I define God as the greatest conceivable being.""

The idea of ""greatness"" is ontologically meaningless, unless you mean sheer size. The same goes for other attributes of god: Most good, the ultimate truth, the ultimate prefection, the all-knowing being etc.

These qualities are purely subjective and do not make sense in objective reality outside human perception.

So, the question is: ""does the Greatest Conceivable Being exists?"" and the answer is obviously: no, because that question is nonsensical.

This sentiment supports the concept of your sex/gender being based on your external physical attributes. It ignores that your brain is very much a physical component of your body, and it's there in the brain that people are Male or Female or SomethingElse.

There is no ""becoming a woman"" or ""becoming a man"". There are only techniques people use to make their outward appearance align with their internal sense of self so they don't feel a jarring reaction every time someone says they are something they are not.

I would strongly encourage you to educate yourself more on this issue, because you'll draw a lot of false conclusions if you don't understand the nature of how sex/gender really behaves scientifically as well as socially/culturally.

"My main concern would be that in some situations, the family could possibly groom a child towards incestuous relationships. If a parent conditions a child to believe that the parent is their future lover, is that healthy? Or that a child should be with their sibling. While you could outlaw this practise, it seems like something that'd be difficult to get at, and I'd rather have the incest banned in general than risk such situations from happening. 

That said, there's always prosecutorial discretion. If it seems obvious that two siblings have had sex and there's been no grooming or anything like that, a prosecutor could just choose not to press charges.

You guys might want to broaden your horizons a bit by looking across the Atlantic. There is quite a successful model in many European countries when it comes to healthcare. In Germany we believe that capitalism needs to be regulated by the state because markets do not solve all problems. It is called social market economy an works quite well since the second work war. We have a healthcare system for everyone and free university education! The funny thing is that the money to start this system came from the us marshal plan after ww2 since America was afraid west Germany would turn a communist country if the markets are not somehow regulated.

"> Is it possible that new developments in particular fields led women away?

You tell me. We'd need to see a massive shift in the field to explain this. Both my parents were software engineers and I'm a CS PhD. In my opinion, there was no sea change in the 80s in terms of the actual work done by computer scientists and software engineers that justifies a massive change in trends among women in CS. 

You are right that the stats I gave do not necessarily indicate sexism. But they do indicate that the ""men and women are just different"" justification is extremely loose. Even if women aren't discouraged by intentional sexism, culture can still play a big role. A lot of people feel that these cultural forces are a problem. ",0.4534261241970021

"My 10 year old daughter has helped me view feminism with a more open mind. As she grows I see her making adult decisions, showing empathy for others, and succeeding both academically and physically in sports. Her curiosity has never been stifled by the phrase, ""you can't do that because you're a girl"", so she is allowed to explore and grow on her own. To her, gender is merely a biological/physical circumstance and in no way inhibits her ability to succeed. She never ceases to amaze me and I have no doubts that if she wanted to, she could be president. By seeing this, it has taught me that determination, intelligence, physical prowess, and love for others cannot be judged based on gender.

How can it be justified that taxpayer funds are used to build and maintain stadiums and the taxpayers are still charged like 50 bucks for admission? Depending of the sport and stadium. Tax payer money goes to building public parks and such, yet we are able to access those for free, right? There are a lot of things that bother me in terms of taxation, how tax dollars are used, and in turn how we have to pay for things that tax dollars already go to support. It really angers me.

"Personally I would rather see vaccinations mandatory and also free. Nobody should be making money off of a way to provide health to others.

If found guilty of not vaccinating then a fine will be issued. If your unvaccinated child is the cause of death of another, then the parent is charged with manslaughter.

Their is no reason why people shouldn't be vaccinated, especially if it we're free.

As it stands today I 100% am behind jailing parents who are the cause of others children who die due to their unvaccinated kids. If your child dies because you decided to not vaccinate then that's on you and I don't think you should be charged with anything.
