"Depends on the situation. Office party? Agreed. Someone you barely know? Agreed.

But it also depends on your culture. The norm in some cultures require the guest to first refuse several times before finally giving in and accepting. The host is expected to continue to offer and attempt to convince the guest until they accept. The guest in these situations often wants to drink, but must be polite and first refuse. This is especially true if the guest is a woman. It would be seen as rude or stingy for the host not to ask the guest several times if they would want a drink.

Spanking a kid doesn't tell a kid *why* not to engage in a behavior; it only teaches them to fear the consequences of the behavior, which might temporarily fix the problem, but if a parent takes the effort to make it clear to the kid why the behavior is wrong, model correct behavior, reward for good behavior, and discipline them properly only if it continues, then that will correct it in their head.

This sentiment supports the concept of your sex/gender being based on your external physical attributes. It ignores that your brain is very much a physical component of your body, and it's there in the brain that people are Male or Female or SomethingElse.

There is no ""becoming a woman"" or ""becoming a man"". There are only techniques people use to make their outward appearance align with their internal sense of self so they don't feel a jarring reaction every time someone says they are something they are not.

I would strongly encourage you to educate yourself more on this issue, because you'll draw a lot of false conclusions if you don't understand the nature of how sex/gender really behaves scientifically as well as socially/culturally.

Some people want everything to belong to one race or another. For example I saw latina women mad because women of other races were wearing hoop earrings. Earrings!!! Things like that are not cultural appropriation. Its not cultural. 
Something that is appropriation is using religious symbols as fashion. Or taking something and lessoning its value. For example, bindis. They are a religious piece of great importance they aren‚Äôt a part of fashion. 
I feel like for it to be appropriation the value or perceived value has to be changed. Earrings mean as much to a black person as the do to a white person. A traditional headdress means something of deep value. Someone who isnt native wearing cheapens its value and makes it seem worthless

Cultural appropriation is like that, but much stronger because it is not about taste but more commonly about symbols that speak to your very identity.

1) Punishment

2) Rehabilitation

3) Deterrent

4) Protection of ""normal"" citizens.

I would argue that if you look at the outcome (high sentences, strong chance of actually getting worse in prison, sexual violence, overcrowding, etc.) you would conclude the obvious motive almost entirely number 4.
