1) drinking in moderation is not especially dangerous (there is a very small increase in cancer/vascular disease risk) 

2) alcohol use is far more widespread than any other drug, so the harmful effects are seen far more often.

"I know someone personally that was a social worker and psychologist in a mid sized city. 

She would always take 1 unpaid intern per social worker to give them an extra set of hands and to let then gain experience. She would often hire these students when they graduated if they had an opening. 

They worked on mostly government contracts. 

The province decided to make unpaid internships illegal. 

She couldn't afford to pay for the extra help, and now both the students who used to be unpaid interns don't have those spots to get experience and her clients/patients don't get the same quality of care. 

while I agree with your concerns about inequality, I think the benefits outweigh the downsides. 

I think there is a middle ground where companies above a certain size cannot use unpaid interns. But TBD. ",0.36456102783725913

"> 1)Prostitutes would be significantly less likely to marry and have kids and having kids is important for our society. Low birth rates and unstable marriages are bad for our society. Most men would not marry prostitutes.

By that rationale, we should also outlaw bars and alcohol because they also facilitate extra-marital sex.  How about also setting a curfew and a bed-time for everyone in America and getting rid of all the filth in music and on television?

It is not the business of the governments to try to outlaw things that don't facilitate marriage.  American adults get to choose what kind of sex life they wish to have with other wiling adults.  No one wants a church-government.

"Married men can do whatever they like, they just have to live with the consequences. 

Same for married women, if, let's say, her husband has let himself go and she just doesn't fancy him any more for sex, but he's still useful for putting shelves up.

Wives do not 'allow' husbands to do things, and vice versa. Marriage is a partnership. If one side of that partnership is not happy with an aspect of it, they need to discuss it.

If one partner (wife or husband) wants to sleep with other people, and the other is ok with it then fine. 

But it must be agreed by both parties otherwise the 'harm' is simply transferred from one party to the other. I would argue it's easier for a man to not have sex than it is for a woman to cope with a cheating husband.",0.5315845824411135

This is a tricky situation - a morally gray area - where the assumptions underlying the drinking are particularly salient.

It's only a problem when it's exploitative. Like white girls wearing bindis and then selling said bindis and then marketing them as Dharma Dots or Dots not Feathers. An insulting marketing of another culture that disrespects said culture to make money. Though this kind of naked exploitation is rarely tolerated on any serious scale so not really a usual concern. I agree that cultural ideas exchanged and flowing between people is not an issue. But exploitation does happen.

That said, there's always prosecutorial discretion. If it seems obvious that two siblings have had sex and there's been no grooming or anything like that, a prosecutor could just choose not to press charges.

"It’s definitely partly the cause, but the cause affects how the kneeling is interpreted. Kneeling for veterans seems like an additional show of respect for our country and those who have served; kneeling for BLM-inspired protest of perceived injustice to African Americans at the hands of police feels to people like a statement that (1) lumps all police officers together as bad, (2) divides black vs white, (3) exaggerates a problem that is actually affecting all races, and (4) judges our country as a place not worthy of respect because it is seriously impeding the black race in 2018. Add to that that the controversial, predictably triggering action is being done at work before a game meant to entertain. 

For those who interpret it that way, including some black people, it seems like the wrong time and place, as well as too easily misinterpreted.

As she grows I see her making adult decisions, showing empathy for others, and succeeding both academically and physically in sports. Her curiosity has never been stifled by the phrase, ""you can't do that because you're a girl"", so she is allowed to explore and grow on her own. To her, gender is merely a biological/physical circumstance and in no way inhibits her ability to succeed. She never ceases to amaze me and I have no doubts that if she wanted to, she could be president. By seeing this, it has taught me that determination, intelligence, physical prowess, and love for others cannot be judged based on gender.

"I think its primarily ethical reasons like you mentioned. Joining or being part of a community that reinforces the idea that abortions and contraception is wrong, well of course they are going to argue against it. Such ideas go against the norms and ideas of right and wrong for their group.

To make an analogy, it would be like trying to create a no pants law. Imagine someone came up with the idea of a no pants law, citing sources and statistics that this no pants law can prevent disease and unwanted children. People not wearing pants would make things uncomfortable at the least, so of course there will be some that fight it, in spite of the benefits. Imagine the uncomfortableness of this situation multiplied by 10 for the concept of abortions. Thats why people fight it., because it goes against their values and makes them uncomfortable",0.4202355460385439

But it also depends on your culture. The norm in some cultures require the guest to first refuse several times before finally giving in and accepting. The host is expected to continue to offer and attempt to convince the guest until they accept. The guest in these situations often wants to drink, but must be polite and first refuse. This is especially true if the guest is a woman. It would be seen as rude or stingy for the host not to ask the guest several times if they would want a drink.

So what you see as pestering is, for the host, a social/cultural obligation.",0.4759100642398287

1) Punishment

2) Rehabilitation

3) Deterrent

4) Protection of ""normal"" citizens.

I would argue that if you look at the outcome (high sentences, strong chance of actually getting worse in prison, sexual violence, overcrowding, etc.) you would conclude the obvious motive almost entirely number 4. If you rehabilitate in jail that's great and I suppose you'll be supported, but its clearly not the main driving force.
