Notability of Accent 45
A tag has been placed on Accent 45 requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.  ' """,0.0

I don't see homosexuality as a phenomenon of degeneration, but rather I see
it in another way. The approach has been of another sort: a more rational

who simply must be respected. This is the philosophy with which I view these
problems. I think that there has to be consideration shown toward the family
that suffers these situations. I would hope that the families would have another

Whilst the article does mention these things in one form or another, it really does need to be succinctly in this location as well. Many readers will come to this page, read the headings and skip straight to the contraversy section. Without differentiating in a small way my two points, we risk the reader coming away with a very biased view of stem cell research as a whole.  
It is a defect of this article that it talks too much about “cures” which indeed gives a biased view. The controversy section is best kept short, as there is a main article. 
I agree, the Controversy section is best kept short, not incorrectly biased and lacking information, as it currently stands.  
The controversy is that some people think that it is immoral to use cells from embryos that will be put in the trashcan otherwise. That is all there is to it. 
Your anaolgy is about as crass as saying """"oh look, theres a dead body there, lets use it for fertilizer, after all, its dead"""". Whilst you might not agree with that analogy, it is roughly how many people would view your point. Your opinion whilst well informed isn't any more right then someone else who adheres to a different belief system. And thank you for clarrifying that it is indeed a contraversial issue. As a side note """"some people"""" covers a large portion of the people on this planet.  
No, because those embryos really do end in trash cans, whatever the whish of the family be. This is the general rule, whereas found bodies end up in the morgue, then are incinerated if not claimed. And the ashes are indeed used as fertiliser in this case. It might seem crass to say so, but it is still the truth. 

Stem cell research should be legalized everywhere. What would happen to people if they had any of their body part burned or worse? Stem cell research could help grow a new one based on the persons DNA et all and reattach back to the body. The wouldn’t reject it because it wont be foreign to it  

 Replace the whole page.

Tony Sidaway is a confirmed and vocal scientologist who often writes lengthy usenet posts describing his involvement with the church of scientology and extolling its virtues.

On wikipedia there was a fake aspie and Tony Sidaway banned him.  Tony gives his reasons for banning: 
 """"I have blocked this editor becausae he's stupid"""" (spelling error preserved) 
 """"he's an obvious nutter ...  Let's just tell him to fuck off."""" 
 """"He's a troll. Our only appropriate words to him are """"fuck off.""""

Routinely, other bureaucratic fucks on wikipedia have blocked Tony. (log of blocks)

He also blocks others for reasons like """"Idiot"""", """"Particularly stupid troll"""" and an admin for """"Persistently flaunting a stupidly large signature with multiple image inclusions.""""

He also harasses banned users by reverting anything they write on their talk pages and protecting it simply by saying, """"they attempted to use their talk page.""""   Note: other wikipedia admins do this abuse, too.

He bans anyone who says the slightest thing even vaguely related to criticizing something even vaguely related to an admin.  He also hides what they say (example).

Yes, those are two reverts; however, the 1RR restriction on myself was only in regards to Canadian monarchy articles, and PoC's edits, not to other pages or other editors. Now, though I was technically within my bounds there, having later read MangoJuice's comments to PoC on reverting and entitlement, I realise that the same applies to myself, and would have applied earlier. That second revert was a kneejerk retaliation to a move that was purposefully irritating, and, though technically allowed, was just a continuation of a dispute, rather than an effort to seek resolution. Anyway, I hope that clears things up.

 Grossly Incorrect 

This article contains gross inaccuracies.  I have added the POV template.  See the discussion under Muslim_Brotherhood#Research_in_Progress.  According to Brynjar Lia's book which I've cited there, neither Banna nor his father studied at Al-Azhar.  According to Lia, Banna was not an admirer of Hitler and strenuously denounced racism as well as the aggressive militarism characteristic of fascism.  According to both Mitchell and Lia, the Brotherhood maintained a policy of avoiding any involvement in World War II.  I've removed these sentences for now, but I will correct this article more thoroughly within the next few weeks.  14:08, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I am restoring the following content which was deleted. 00:02, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)

 Education 

 Banna, who had a sizable Islamic library at home, was a graduate of al-Azhar Theological Seminary, a top Muslim seminary. Shaikh noticed Hassan's intelligence and sent him to memorize the Qur'an early in childhood. Hassan memorized the entire Qur'an. He was known for being very articulate as he gave sermons in Mosques at a young age.
 Four years earlier than his peers, Hassan attended Mosque of Al-Azhar at the age of 16 where he graduated as the first in his class. He refused a scholarship opportunity from The Ministry of Education in Europe.

 ODESSA 

 Hassan al Banna was an admirer of Adolf Hitler and wrote supportive letters to Hitler. Hassan was solicited by Nazi intelligence when Hitler rose to power In the 1930's. He established a Nazi Germany spy network throughout the Arabian Peninsula for Hitler. Al Banna promised Hitler that when Gen. Rommel's panzer division arrived in Cairo and Alexandria, the Muslim Brotherhood would ensure that all of the British troops would be killed.

This was removed by an anonymous editor with the claim that it is unproven non-sense. 30 June 2005 02:29 (UTC)

 Coffee Houses Comment 
Can anyone verify the comment that Coffee houses were """"morally suspect""""? I find that difficult to believe. Eqypt had a fairly freewheeling society at the time- something Hassan Al-Banna was against- and one could do much worse than coffee houses.

 Rewrite Using Scholarly Sources 

I have posted an entirely new text for the Muslim Brotherhood and
Hassan al Banna articles, as well as several new articles:

 History of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt
 History of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt (1928-1938)
 History of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt (1939-1954)
 History of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt (1954-present)
 History of the Muslim Brotherhood in Syria

This amounts to over 12,000 words of text, and is the result of months of research, discussed in Talk:Muslim_Brotherhood, using reputable scholarly texts found at the library of the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London.  Every paragraph in the main articles is marked with page-number references to the work it is based on.

I am not an expert on this subject, and nothing in these articles is original; I have simply summarised the material in the sources listed.

to me everyone is gonna have an oppinon on this subject so here is mine people born from 1964 to 1981 are gen xers gen y starts in 1982.it just seems logical to me. me im born in 1977 i definetly consider myself a gen xer because all my teen years were spend in the early and mid ninties when grunge and alternative music ruled the music scene.i mean when i started high school people were still listening to winger and warrant for god sake by my second year everybody had flannel shirts and riped jeans and were listening to pearl jam and gangster rap.if you were gonna snip a couple of years off the gen i would not snip 80 or 81 i would snip 64 and 65.",0.0

"Glaring evidentiary deficiency not reported herein wrt George Zimmerman's account of events 

Recent photos of Zimmerman shortly after the shooting made by the police show no blood spatter on his front including his shirt.  His account claims that Martin was directly over him when he shot him.  Yet a 9mm hollow point wound in Martin's front chest would be expected to shower blood all over Zimmerman.  This evidence clearly contradicts Zimmerman's account.  Another report indicates that the shot was fired from more than 18 inches away.  This contrary evidence and contradiction in Zimmerman's story should be noted in this wiki article.  Speculation is that Zimmerman achieved standing (off the ground from a lying down position) status after Martin's struggled with him and then shot him with his 9mm as payback for the beating upon himself which he had apparently initiated.  By leaving these facts out of the article it suggests that wiki authors are suspedning the laws of gravity and common sense.  BTW, who locked the article down from further editing?

Results:
 9 Users opposed the renaming
 17 Users supported the renaming

Discussion:
 Still, this topic is controversial and therefore before changing anything this should be discussed here.
 Please feel free to come up with ideas for a new lemma inculding war  

Including Hezbollah in the name
I would include the name of Hezbollah in the title for four reasons:
1) They instigated the conflict
2) They are one of the primary military force currently engaged
3) This is not a war between two soverign countries as the title suggests
4) While they are part of the Lebanon government, thier military arm has seperate command and control

user:mnw2000 
I agree. It should be Israel-Hizbollah_conflict, Lebanon has little to do with it.  
 I agree, Lebanon army is not a participant, though casualties are mostly Libanese. 'Libanon' in the name is false.  
 Hezbollah is acting independantly of Lebanon, so Hezbollah should be in the name instead of Lebanon.  

I agree as well. Technically, it is not the Israel-Lebanon conflict but the Israel-Hezbollah conflict. Lebanon's troops are not involved. Israel is not targeting Lebonan but Hezbollah. Unfortunately, Hezbollah has established itself in the middle of Lebanon.

No. Use the example of the existing name in 1982 Lebanon War 

How about this compromise The Israel-Hezbollah War in Lebanon (2006) any thoughts. 

Agree with TheFEARgod. Conflict or TheFEARgod's use of War is Neutral. The examples used to cite use of the term """"war"""" are of concern.  Should Hezbollah sources which refer to fighting as """"Sixth-Arab-Israeli war"""" make it sensible to use that?  Each side aims for certain propaganda/morale advantages when using term """"war"""".  Why are editors so eager to have this article renamed to a war?  I can understand the reasoning behind the arguments but what is the rush?  

I think the rush is legitimate, because readers may think calling it a """"conflict"""" is trying to downplay the event.  It would be like someone writing an article about the """"September Conflict in New York"""" referring to 9/11.  In Lebanon, to the people dying, I'm sure they'd rather it be called a """"massacre"""", so """"conflict"""" would certainly be an understatement.
I don't think the precendent of the 1982 Lebanon War means anything.  It was a different event in a different century and the Lebanese government was much more involved in the war, even agreeing to sign a peace treaty with Israel at one point (see the article).  Besides, I feel the article should reflect the time period in which it's written and it's clear from all the discussion on this page that the """"Israel-Lebanon War"""" would be hotly contested by the community.  20:37, 2 August 2006 (EST)

Hezbollah is bombing Israel, so the conflict isn't only taking place in Lebanon, you'd need to include both places or use a broader term like """"The Middle East""""  

Check the title again: """"Israel-Lebanon conflict."""" It does contain Israel.

Also, this morning, NPR referred to this as """"the Israeli-Hezbollah conflict."""" I'm not sure how other media outlets are referring to it, but if they're also using """"Hezbollah,"""" then that's what we should do. -[[User:",0.0

"That's a difficult question.  I think a lot of it is a matter of just doing it on a day-to-day basis in every discussion we have on WP, whether on an article talk page, a deletion discussion, or at VP.  Maybe there could be a guideline (or even just an essay) urging people not to rely on rote policy citation regurgitation in lieu of substantive explanation (maybe there already is one somewhere?).  And reminding people that citing policy is at best only half the work: you may have settled on what you think governs the issue, but you still need to convince others of the best way to apply it in a particular circumstance.  To do it properly the focus should always be on what the best editorial decision is, not just the superficial level of what complies with codified policy or guidelines.  Yeah, all that should be written down somewhere if it isn't already.  In another guideline for people to cite.  ; )

I think also we could go policy by policy, guideline by guideline, and ask ourselves whether its purpose is clear.  What does it substantively accomplish.  That may not always be evident; it may reflect the way consensus tends to go without an articulate reason as to why.  A history of how the policy was written could be interesting, but maybe not that helpful, and it would be difficult to summarize.  Just looking at the edit history of a particular policy or guideline may omit a lot of developmental discussions that occurred on the talk pages of other policies, the Village pump, or even user talk pages.

As to RoyBoy, he is not very good at checking his facts. Even a cursory Google would show that Jonathan Sarfatti and Jack Sarfatti are not the same person and live on different continents. Notice how silent the Great Mathematician Dr. Hillman is in the light of Nobel Prize physicist Brian Josephson's remark above putting him in his proper place and in Hillman's inability to respond to Sarfatti's detailed argument above. It is not enough to bluster """"it's nonsense"""". Burinski will also respond he is not on e-mail all the time. None of your facts check out. Everything Sarfatti has said is the truth and his arguments on the physics have not been refuted. You people not only have no respect for truth, you simply cannot even perceive it because this information is too advanced for all of you - even Chris Hillman who is not a physicist although he is a mathematician of sorts - he admits he is not even interested in quantum theory so he should recuse himself if he were really honest.

My concern about your username (Heavybuddha)

Hello, , and thank you for contributing to Wikipedia!

I hope not to seem unfriendly or make you feel unwelcome, but I noticed your username, and am concerned that it might not meet Wikipedia's username policy. After you look over that policy, could we discuss that concern here?

I'd appreciate learning your own views, for instance your reasons for wanting this particular name, and what alternative username you might accept that avoids raising this concern.

You have several options freely available to you:
 If you can relieve my concern through discussing it here, I can stop worrying about it.
 If the two of us can't agree here, we can ask for help through Wikipedia's dispute resolution process, such as asking for a """"third opinion"""", or requesting comments from other Wikipedians. Admins usually abide by agreements reached through this process.
 You can keep your contributions history under a new username. Visit Wikipedia:Changing username and follow the guidelines there.

Let me reassure you that my writing here means I don't think your username is grossly, blatantly, or obviously inappropriate; such names get reported straight to Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism (WP:AIV), or blocked on sight. This is more a case where opinions might differ, and it would be good to reach some consensus — either here or at WP:RFC/NAME. So I look forward to a friendly discussion, and to enjoying your continued participation on Wikipedia. Thank you again!   Talk   """,0.0

 Is User:Irvine22 a disruptive editor? 

There has been a long-standing issue with Irvine22, primarily on the PIRA page, but also on others.  Irvine22 has been confirmed as a puppetmaster for the purposes of block evasion, refused to acknowledge or apologize for the incident, and then began to implement a series of disruptive, POV edits without discussing the matter on the talk page.  His edits have been almost universally reverted, and yet he continues to make them, after being told many times by many editors as well as one admin to raise issues on the talk page first.  He shows no sign of ceasing this behaviour, nor will he acknowledge, much less address, any criticism of it.  The page's resident admin, User:Rd232, suggested that I raise the matter on the ANI page if it continued, so that is what I am doing now.

Following is a small sampling of Irvine22's more recent edits.  Note that I have only selected edits for which there was no consensus, that were later reverted.  These also all occurred after his block and subsequent sockpuppetry.  They also occurred after he was repeatedly told not to edit the article without first seeking consensus, or at the very least providing an adequate source.  

The edits:

  This edit was reverted, and a new section started on the talk page.  Instead of trying to reach a consensus, he restored the edit with the explanation """"per discussion"""".  It was not.

 This POV edit was reverted.  Irvine22 restored it.  It was reverted again.  So he restored it again.  It was reverted again and he was told to bring the matter up on the talk page.  So he restored it again.  And again.  And again.  Actually a quick glance at the page's history will show you the behaviour he regularly partakes in. I really wish I could link to more, but I simply don't have the time.  Rest assured, there are dozens.

Talk page disruption begins here

Irvine22 has also been dismissive of advice and instructions to change his editing habits, as can be seen here, and especially on the PIRA talk page, beginning here.

Note Irvine22's polite yet dismissive tone throughout all of this.  He is almost pathologically incapable of acknowledging any wrongdoing on his part, or criticism of his actions.  I am not sure if this is a deliberate attempt to game, or the result of some actual personality disorder for which he cannot be fully faulted. 

I haven't the time to go digging through his edit history.  I really wish I did.  I will, however, link to this page on the PIRA talk page and invite further comments from the editors there.

Thank you for your time. 

P.S.  I apologize if this request is not in the correct category.  It crosses several, and I didn't want to pigeonhole it as a 3rr issue, as the problem extends far beyond simple edit warring.""",0.0

NPOV concerns

I tend to agree with the NPOV concerns of some comments here.  They seem to be more along the lines of what is *not* included than what is.  To be fair, a google search returned far more of the 'critical' sources than any other.

However, I was able to make a minor edit I regard as an improvement. I replaced one Guardian article, """"Iran contra men return to power"""" with another from the same publication, the """"Negroponte: Amercia's voice of experience"""" article.

I believe the former article is redundant to many of the others, and as the least specific to Mr. Negroponte is the least relevent.  The latter article I believe balances the collective tone of the references, and does not omit mention of the Honduras accusations.

However, I have retained the old article here:

 """"Iran-contra men return to power""""(from The Guardian)

"You've touched on the very essence of the problem - I am not Victor9876 just as you are not Favonian. The distintion is that people, act differently under a veil of anonimity, which is what the monikers are for. If I had known in the beginning of the WP experience, that exchanges among monikers can create hostile environments, I may have not used a moniker (though I did try to use my real name and it was rejected). Another issue, is that defenses I have (there are a few that I don't), are so far in the past, and require due diligence, that I'm sure no one would want to take the time to research them. Also, there have been many exchanges that led to responses, that were being resopnded to, only to have a block or ban already in place, when I went to save the response. The truth of the matter is that I am guilty of poor reactions in the past, but my reactions had some justification to them. Perhaps the one that stands out the most, was when Ramiro Martinez' page, allowed his vanity publication to stand in the article, which helps him sell books, where an audio history I had of McCoy, was not allowed to stand, which would possibly have helped McCoy as well. It was the double standard that caused the spiraling down of the conversation. Again, I believe the moniker scenario should go, as Sanger tried to deny the moniker system before his departure. It would make WP a better environment, without agenda seeking socks and monikers. Just my opinion, and everyone else I talk to. Thanks for the reply. 64.134.6.107",0.0

Mmmm, this is a tricky issue. The debate as I see it is between providing a useful article for readers desiring information not otherwise contained in Wikipedia, and providing something basically inaccurate. For example, Brooklyn Beckham (the son of footballer David Beckham) was deemed not notable enough to merit his own Wikipedia article. Hence the link from Brooklyn Beckham redirects to the """"Personal life"""" section of his dad's article. Not strictly accurate, but probably the most useful link for people who want to know about Brooklyn. In the absence of an article about Gadara (Umm Qais), if there was no other article related to Gadara, the same might apply to the redirect to Legion (demon). The alternative would be to create a stub article which basically has just one or two lines of text, including a link tothe Legion (demon). This would give people the option of expanding it later on if they so desired. thanks  —   """,0.0

The article is an essay written from an assumption (and in fact pretty much stated as """"fact"""") that Jesus was the """"new sycretism"""". This is, to put it frankly, quite far from the truth and though the info should be stated that such and such stated such and such, there should not be an entire article, especially one like CheeseDreams created. Why do you think I'm not opposing that a merge be done? Sheesh. You'd think I'm trying to destroy CheeseDreams life works or something. -  15:47, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)

I would NPOV the article if I could. I can't. Why? Because the material isn't reference properly. Incidently, don't hold your breath for CheeseDreams to come back. She posted her password to a known trolls page and forced another admin to log in to her account quickly and change the password. She no longer has access to her account! In fact, we found 5 verified sock puppets of CheeseDreams (all with the same password) and she no longer has access to these accounts. You might want to note that I did start adding material: I have created an article The Two Babylons, which I encourage you to help me make more complete (I've only done the first two sections - and not even that). In the process I edited the article to clear up some misconceptions of CheeseDreams (like for instance she called Alexander Hislop a """"scholar"""", which he most certainly wasn't). 
However, I'm not sure how much time I have for you. I'm a little confused personally. The other day I was accused by a Stormfront member of being a traitor to the white race and/or a Jew, however today you tell me I'm a Nazi. Would you people please make up your minds? I'm getting mighty confused. -  17:20, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)

 Personal attacks 
I mentioned it before, now I'll say it here. Please do not make personal attacks on your fellow editors. This includes comparing them to Nazis or making other allegations or implications regarding their personal character, as you did recently regarding TBSDY. If your position has merit, you should be able to establish your position on its own merits without resorting to such attacks. Article talk pages are (in general) intended for discussing how best to improve the article. VfD talk pages are for discussing reasons for and against deleting articles. They are not for discussing editors. Also, please don't demand that other editors do your research for you.

I fucking cut his pinky off and didnt snitch like a little bitch like you. I take lazy ass niggers like you and stomp you with my fat nazi heel. you should be FUCKING sorry you ever fucked with me or my dad (Steve Jobs).

"Pronunciation & Music Definition
electro, e·lec·tro [ i léktro ], electro-funk, e·lec·tro-funk [ i léktro-fungk ]

noun

1. music, Same as electronic music.

2. ELECTRO (music), Electro (also known as Electro-Funk) is an electronic style of hip hop directly influenced by Kraftwerk, Jazz-Funk and Funk records (unlike earlier rap records that were closer to disco). Records in the genre are unabashed about their use of electronic and artificial sounds, taking this technological fetish almost into science fiction with many records about space travel and futuristic dystopias. Timing range is 118 to 135 beats per minute(BPM). Electro is a derivitive of the '[Roland TR-808 Rhythm Composer, Roland TR-909 Rhythm Composer, Roland SVC-350 Vocoder, Roland VP-330 Vocoder Plus, Roland VP-330 Vocoder]' Drum machines & Vocoder's Speech Synthesizer. Electro's sound is distinctively synthetic, instrumental, electronic and experimental. Additionally, the 808 drum machines pounding beats and pure sounds were heavily used in Hip Hop, Disco and Funk music. It was very popular in New York City during the early 1980s and late 1970s.",0.0

 Potsdam Declaration 

Here some quotation from the """"Official Gazette of the control council for Germany"""" (Documents relating to the establishment of the Allied Control Authority) - published by the """"Allied Secretariat"""" in Berlin, Elssholzstrase 32.

Under item VI (Statement by the Governments of the United Kingdom, the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republic and the Provisional Government of the French Republic on the zones of occupation in Germany) they write:

""""1. Germany, within her frontiers as they were on 31st December, 1937, will, for purposes of occupation, be divided into four zones, one to be alloted to each Power as follows ...""""

Under item  VIII (Report on the Tripartite Conference of Berlin) and there Article IX concerning the western frontier of Poland they write:

""""The three Heads of Government reaffirm their opinion that the final delimitation of the western frontier of Poland should await the peace settlement.""""

Until this peace conference the disputed territories """"shall be under the administration of the Polish State and for such purposes should not be considered as part of the Soviet Zone of occupation in Germany.""""

So keeping in mind this facts sincerely it´s obvious that the (West-) Allies didn´t order any transfer of Germans out of their ancestral homelands because by doing this they would have created a fait accompli. 

Actually Russia and Poland created such accomplished facts by expelling most of that Germans - even quite long before the Potsdam Declaration. 

(Comment: Any forced transfer of population is a crime against humanity; and this it was already at times of 1945 - Nazi-Germany was trialed exactly for such crimes, too.)

 (1) The anonymous assertions are unsourced and (2) the anonymous assertions are, well, anonymous.  This alone puts it in the range between gossip and libel.  Furthermore, as there are no sources, Wikipedia:Verifiability is violated. Please tell me how you believe I am wrong.  With all the text on this talk page, no one has supplied even one source that verifies the anonymous assertion. cite your sources: """"If you doubt the accuracy or origin of an unsourced statement that has been in an article for a long time, delete it or move it to the talk page.""""  
 Can you improve the section, including sources and lack of anonymous weasel phrases, rather than reverting it back to this original, disputed form?  

 Verifiability 

Wikipedia:Verifiability states that """"3. The obligation to provide a reputable source is on editors wishing to include information, not on those seeking to remove it."""".  Until such time that this policy is met, the section currently entitled 'Scientist' should be removed for lack of verifiability coupled with reliance on weasel phrasing as the support for the entire section.  This is further born out by the cite your sources section that states """"If the article has many unsourced statements that have been there a long time, you may request sources on the talk page before removing them, unless the article or information is about a living person, in which case remove the unsourced information"""" (emphasis mine).  This is mandatory policy.  Please adhere to it until such time as editors can provide sources and/or rewrite the section with appropriate sourcing.  Thanks  

The information that you are complaining about isn't about a person.  It's about critics/supporters.  You are wilfully misinterpreting policy.  Please stop.   

 That is an incorrect assessment.  The unsourced information is about Sarfati.  That it is attributed to anon critics/supporters and is unsourced is the reason that it is unverifiable.  Can you provide sources for the assertions?  If not, it should be deleted according to the verifiability policy.  (Also, I respectfully request that this discussion be about content rather than personal commentary directed at mei.e. """"willfully""""Thank you)

"Wikipedia:No confidence
Edicts from above are a growing concern for those who believe Wikipedia should be what it purports itself to be in newspapers, magazines, and to new members: a community of editors. As a community, we believe that members who have greater power should use that power to promote consensus and a neutral point of view. When an administrator abuses his or her greater power to promote self interest or personal POV against or without the consent of the community, we believe that member should lose his or her administrative or higher powers. Would you be interested in starting and/or promoting a Wikipedia:No confidence area for the purpose of demoting administrators and above who use their power to push personal POV?

In such an area, any editor could call for a show of support or no-confidence for an administrator or higher. People would sign for either support or no-confidence along with examples of the editor in question creating an edict without consensus, or a statement of why they believe the alleged edicts are in line with community consensus. Please feel free to start or add to Wikipedia:No confidence and to duplicate this message or tell other editors who want to see Wikipedia succeed. KIMP (spewage)",0.0

"""confess (even though I agree with the author that abstance doesn't work) this article is very POV, toward a liberal side. 

It's not POV if it's true

Just because there is controversy over a subject does               I LIKE WAFFLES                    not mean that a NPOV gives equal weight to both sides. If all (or nearly all) studies on a subject support one POV (as is clearly the case with abstinence; see Sex Education) , then while we should note that there is a controversy there is no reason not to write the most objectively true statements we can about it.

To say abstinence doesn't work is POV. In fact, studies have suggested that abstinence education does work. Abstinence education, for example, has been successful in Uganda. The Family Research Council has a few studies on this issue. Sure, the FRC is a conservative think tank but that doesn't mean its findings don't have validity or merit.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 154.20.204.92   

 Law Section needs work 

The section on laws appears to be complete rubbish.  I've attempted to rewrite it to make sense and be somewhat meaningful but it needs references, timeframes etc.  Who says that laws like this only reduce teenage pregnancy by 0.92%?  When did Texas pass its law?  Is it still valid?  What does the Texan law state are the punishments for teen-teen sex?  Give a case history where the punishment was as unequal as this article says.  What has been the effect of this law?

The original section said something about many goverments, states etc trying to pass these laws but they got killed(?) because of something to do with age of concent laws and human rights.  Give specifics.  Cite a Country/other body (and date and preferably leader of government) which tried to pass these laws and what happened.  Where such laws have been repealed give good examples.

Personally I'm tempted to remove the whole Laws section pending something more meaningful being written.  I'd fix the section myself but I don't have any information on what laws have been passed in this regard.

 Abstinence section 

The absitnence section is still suffering badly from POV problems (both before and after an extensive editing in the last two days).  The discussion of the debate about education belongs in Sex education, particullarly as this is very US-centric at the moment and there is a section there for that (it may be broken out to it's own article as well).  I've tried to edit the article on the whole to improve POV, but some help is still greatly needed  

Added UK-specific details
I've added quite a lot of UK stuff to the article: perhaps someone from the US could add some more detail about contrasting US policies? I've tried not to touch the bits about the causes of TP, so I hope the new stuff's not too POV. I've also deleted some stuff about marriage - I couldn't see what it added.  I'm really up for doing some more work on this article, if someone wants to get in touch to discuss some of the issues.   

Under 19
It may seem illogical, but teenage pregnancy is only considered as such if the mother is aged 18 or under at the time of conception, hence """"under 19"""" not """"under 20"""" - government interventions in the UK and elsewhere take this age bracket as the location of the """"social problem"""" to which this article refers.  It's not a copy-editing mistake, so I've reverted the previous change.  I'm also interested in the comment that """"the term used to apply to girls under 13 becoming pregnant"""" - I've never heard it used in this way in the UK, could you enlighten me? Thanks.   

I wish it was 21. I don't think it's possible to be ready for parenthood nowadays at that age, espeically with the rising cost of living. I also think that technically nineTEEN is still a teenager. They are also young adults, but they are still a teen. Most 19 year olds probably won't consider themselves teenagers and THAT is ok, but they are technically still that..a teen.

The reason that you were cautioned about your behaviour on the Anita Sarkeesian talkpage is that you were using the space, not to propose improvements to the page, but to criticise the person that it's about. Wikipedia takes this very seriously because the whole site can be found responsible for things that editors like you and I say, even if it's not in article space. For this reason, biographies of living people are taken very seriously, and come under the most scrutiny of any Wikipedia articles. Here is the appropriate policy, it's vital that you read it if you want to edit articles about living people.

With regard to the Anita Sarkeesian article, if there are specific additions that you want to make to it, please suggest those on the talkpage. """"She's a liar"""" is insufficient, you need to find a notable source whose content you want to add. This policy details how we determine what sources are notable.

At the end of the day, though, whatever you believe, Wikipedia is going to describe the positions and opinions of a lot of people you disagree with. That doesn't mean that Wikipedia endorses those points of view, simply that they are notable people whose statements and actions are worth documenting here. At least until you get a bit of experience, I strongly recommend you stick to uncontroversial topics, or BLPs of people whom you agree with.  

You must clearly be blind take a second look at the very top of this page and you'll see a link to libel on it.

Your Eminences and Excellencies in the Field Of Prophecy 

The Prophecy list known as of Saint Malachy refers to the Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church 
Tarcisio Pietro Evasio Bertone named Pietro and born in Romano, thus Peter the Roman.

Tarcisio Pietro Evasio Bertone, in the absence of a Pope was thus and in fact fulfilling in the Office of  “Pope in Charge”, and now to some extent he Tarcisio Pietro Evasio Bertone along with another office in the Vatican hold more power than the actual Pope, thus his Office is of a more intricate and hands on job of power, than that of a Pope.

In relation to what is referred to the destruction of Rome and the Terrible Judge.

This part of the Prophecy is yet to come, and we are in the momentum of the early days of such events.

 unexplained edit 

On May 17 2006 someone changed the title of a sub-heading, without offering an explanation.  The original title was 
Captures in """"the War on Terror"""", which was changed simply to """"events"""".  I don't see how the new subheading is an improvement.  Counter-terrorism  officials executed a series of raids in Faisalabad on September 11 2002 - the anniversary of September 11, 2001 - arresting dozens of men, many of whom ended up being held in the Guantanamo Bay detainment camps.

I would appeal but something tells me to much shit damage and retarded admins will make this impossible, and I would rather not use the IP of my other account (using a real connection n my personal internet) because then you guys will probably be jackass and deleted for fun, look at this page! All this shit and nothing clicked in your small head? Amazing wikipedia. 

Also I need to take note to stay away from low ranked video game pages and focus on popular until you guys get tired of the act.

Also I KNOW you guys got an account that is going to post a bit after I submit this post I SAW him and he did the EXACT same thing 3 of the duded did, you guys need help, I can't believe not one guy was not like """"this shit don't make sense"""" for a whole second. Amazing.

 I believe in their Indoaryan Origin (or Iranians of India). 

Certainly from what ive seen, read and experienced about Roma people i think that they certainly show close resemalance to similar Nomads of Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and  just North India (not south India); yet i don´t agree that the historians or anthropologist should keep on mentioning India as the origin of their people, since India is to big a concept and ethnicity to do so. We must first encounter that really India as a concept is borrowing or a creation of the invading Aryans (indoeuropeans of iranian orign) that actually settled up north in between Pakistan and Afghanistan as the origin of this culture (later tu establish themselves in Rajasthan, Jammu-Kashmir, Guajarat and north-west regions basically to extend their culture)

It is precisly the regions of the """"Sindhu River"""" between mountains of Afghanistan and the Pakistnian valleys of """"Kashmir"""" and """"Punjab"""" the real home of Hinduism and """"indoaryans"""" (indoiranians).

So what i mean, is that if we talk about """"gypsy"""" people we must talk not precisaly about India but first about Pakistani or Afghan-Iranian aryan culture and tribes that entered those regions invading the aboriginal populations and established a new culture.

That is why many people feel (i am one) that """"roma"""" people have more connections to mesapotamia or semitic peoples since many forget to mention that indoarians (invading iranians) where culturally and ethnically closer to Semites, Huns and Greeks that came from Iran (a fusion between them peoples id say). 

Precisly the Romani languague closely resembles Punjabi and Hindi yet more closer even to Pothohari and mountain languages of Pakistan and Afghanistan (were there are many nomadic tribes).

That is the reason why many gypsy dont look Indian (south indian atleast) but more Persian, Iranian, Kurdish, Dardic, Drokpas or Pashtu people and dont have dravidian traits of austrolid or asian origin; but certinaly resemble a mix of southern european mediteraneas (iranian-greek) mixed with semitic traits. M

Many gyspys have long beards as how old nomadic VEDIC ARYANS (sun worshipers, budda etc) had; as well as have green eyes and a reddish tone to their skin like people for centuries where nomads in the mountain areas of Pakistan, North India and Afghanistan. What i mean to say is that they dress,look,act,and their music is more similar to people like the Kurds,Dards,Guajars,Pashtus,Pothoharis,Kashmiris and Punjabis than to dravidian-mongolian or austrolid indians.

We must also remember that the apperance of those nomadic indoeuropean (iranian) and others partly semitic-iranian-hun-greekish people; is how old ARYANS used to look like; add to that a reddish tone of skin since they lived in the mountains. 

The dress of gypsy people closely resembles more Iranin or Afghan nomadi peoples. The tipical jewlery and earings of women nomads in those areas is one sign. Also the long hair used buy man plus earings close resembles those aryan conceptos of sunworshipping worriors that where great horse riders and metalsmiths who brought Cattle_Cows to the desert and tropical areas of Pakistan and India; that was how historically dravidians described those whiter skinned, mostage-bearded men that invaded their more asian-austroloid land.

I believe Gypsys or Roma are descendants of the """"Indoaryan"""" of  orgin worriors of """"iranian origin"""" that settled in the mountanous regions of Pakistan (Pothohari-Kashmir) and those who went into the deserts of Rajasthan (Rajputs-Jatts). I believe these people gatthered together to defend themselves from invading Muslims as did classical persiands; yet where defeated and pride got to them so they fled their land since they wanted to continue their concept of nomadic sunworshippers.

Gypsyes do not resemble dravidian culturs but more Irani (Persian)Afghani(Pashtu)-Punjabi-Kashmiri-Rajasthani-Harayana-Brhamman cultures of indoeuropean or irani-scythian-greekish influence and language...

Gypsy Music is not only resembled in the famous ZARDS, the primitive Tangos or Boleros of Romania, Hungary and Russia; and Flamenco or Cante Jondo but u can trace their indoaryan music in Country,Rock and Roll-Hippie Music, Fox Trot-Jazz; and ofcourse latin american rythms like: Rumba, Salsa, Bolero, Tango, Peruvian Valse, Tondero, Zamacueca, Charchalera, Milonga etc...

It errant living and the suffering of a worrior people that pridley did not accept the imposition of mongolian or muslim invaders; so they fled with their women and similar tribes of indoaryan origin into the western regions; saddly to know they to large and were not given any help they dedicated themselves to music, entertainment (circus-acrobats-scene players) and poets; yet they mained t",0.0

 RF, Starlight problem 

Dear Slim

I request that you mediate in an issue, Starlight problem where an editor keeps reverting despite violating the rules against providing sources.  

Two main things:

The section Distant Starlight Problem#First attempts to address the problem has no sources.  Those who insist on this section have been repeatedly asked to state which early creationists proposed such a thing, and when.  For example, the statement """"In the early part of the twentieth century most Young Earthers would assert that the stars were not in fact as far away as science suggests"""" lacks any reference to a creationist from 1900-1950.

A section Tu quoque is repeatedly deleted although it was sourced to a creationist who made this argument in one of their publications.  The question is not whether it is a good or bad argument; rather, in a page of a problem for creationists, it is proper to state creationist responses that can be sourced.  """,0.0

Hello, and welcome to Wikipedia!

I hope that I don't seem unfriendly or make you feel unwelcome, but I noticed your username, and I am concerned that it might not meet Wikipedia's username policy for the following reason: NO REASON GIVEN. After you look over that policy, could we discuss that concern here?

I'd appreciate learning your views, for instance, your reasons for wanting this particular name, and what alternative username you might accept that avoids raising this concern.

There are several options available to you:
 We can talk about it, here. 
 You can abandon the contributions made under this name and create a new account that meets our username policy and addresses the concern(s) noted above.
 Or, if you want to keep your contributions history under a new name, then you should visit Wikipedia:Changing username and follow the instructions there.

If we can't resolve this on our own, we can ask for help through Wikipedia's dispute resolution process, such as requesting comments from other Wikipedians.  Wikipedia administrators usually abide by agreements reached through this process.      ♦ ♣ ♠ """,0.0

Notability of Binaria (Collective)
 A tag has been placed on Binaria (Collective) requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a real person, organization (band, club, company, etc.), or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

 HST > Notable? 

832, In the heading it says: """"Notable roles"""". The three previous mentions were roles that the play and/or film, Truman was the main subject, taking up the bulk of screen/stage time and lines. These also won critical acclaim. The combination of the amount of script and praise is what made these portrayals of Truman notable. Does your addition really fit: """"Notable""""? There have been lots of roles with Truman in them:

Flags of Our Fathers (2006) Played by David Patrick Kelly (as President Truman)
Hiroshima (2005) (TV) Played by Kenneth Jay (as Truman)
The Messenger: Based on a True Story (2005) Played by Raymond Starzmann (as President Truman)
Keep the Faith, Baby (2002) (TV) Played by Cedric Smith (as U.S. President Truman)
""""Futurama"""" - Roswell That Ends Well (2001) TV episode, Played by Maurice LaMarche (as President Harry Truman)
""""The Korean War"""" (2001) TV series Played by Harris Shore (as President Harry Truman)
""""The Simpsons"""" - The Trouble with Trillions (1998) TV episode, Played by Dan Castellaneta (as President Truman)
""""Dark Skies"""" - Moving Targets (1996) TV episode, Played by Hansford Rowe (as President Harry Truman)
Truman (1995) (TV) Played by Gary Sinise
Hiroshima (1995) (TV) Played by Kenneth Welsh (as President Harry S Truman)
Brenda Starr (1989) Played by Ed Nelson (as President Harry S. Truman)
Day One (1989) (TV) Played by Richard Dysart (as President Harry S. Truman)
""""War and Remembrance"""" (1988) TV series Played by Richard Dysart (as President Harry S Truman)
J. Edgar Hoover (1987) (TV) Played by Walker Edmiston
Eleanor, First Lady of the World (1982) (TV) Played by Richard McKenzie
Inchon (1981) Played by Ed Flanders (as President Harry S. Truman)
Enola Gay: The Men, the Mission, the Atomic Bomb (1980) (TV) Played by Ed Nelson (as President Harry S Truman)
""""Backstairs at the White House"""" (1979) TV series Played by Harry Morgan (as President Harry S. Truman)
MacArthur (1977) Played by Ed Flanders (as President Harry S. Truman)... aka MacArthur, the Rebel General (UK) 
Tail Gunner Joe (1977) (TV) Played by Robert Symonds (as President Harry S. Truman)
Harry S. Truman: Plain Speaking (1976) (TV) Played by Ed Flanders
Truman at Potsdam (1976) (TV) Played by Ed Flanders (as President Harry S Truman)
Collision Course: Truman vs. MacArthur (1976) (TV) Played by E.G. Marshall (as President Harry S Truman)... aka Collision Course (USA: short title) 
Give 'em Hell, Harry! (1975) Played by James Whitmore (as Harry S Truman)
The Man from Independence (1974) Played by Robert Vaughn (as Harry S Truman)
The Beginning or the End (1947) Played by Art Baker (as President Harry S. Truman)

But, Give 'em Hell, Harry! and Truman, both on stage and screen where entirely about Truman. In Give 'em Hell (if you have seen it), there is nobody else. It is a one-man play, 100% of the lines are portraying Truman. And Flanders played Truman at least four times, including the bulk of the work being about him in at least two occasions; Harry S.

 Boat Race reviews 

  The Running Man Barnstar Hey Dom497, just a quick barnstar to say thanks for the reviews of Boat Race articles you've conducted over the past year.  As of this morning, I completed my (initial) goal of ensuing that every Boat Race had, not only its own article, but one that was either of GA or FA status:  we now have 158 GAs and 3 FAs that we can all be proud of!  It doesn't stop here, for me at least, I'm going to keep up with improving the quality of the GAs and look for more FA opportunities.  Plus, there's the small matter of 70 Women's Boat Race articles to get up and running!  But thanks again, I couldn't have done it without your help.

"Tom, supply and demand are not the same.  They intersect to create price.  If demand is high and supply is low, price is high... etc.  Petroleum can be stored in many places, such as in the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve (727 million barrels).  Global strategic petroleum reserves hold over 4 billion barrels.  Supply, which is the refined petroleum (and other liquids) available in the open market, is affected by releases of strategic reserves (note that production is not the same as supply).  Depending on the source you read demand and usage might not even be the same thing, as demand might include buyers for strategic reserves.  

Most of the big issues with Peak oil begin with the fact that until recently demand has grown very steadily for a long time, catching up with production.  When production can not go up anymore (and begins to decline), the strategic reserves will slowly be used up until supply also begins to decline.  Then usage will be forced to decline, but demand could theoretically keep going up (imagine a room with one cupcake, full of people yelling for more).

 Kosebamse's anti-Cubic crusade

Secondly, you demand testable predictions. I will firstly point out that most theories have values other than the capacity to predict the outcome of experiments. Had relativity been formulated only after all its implications had been verified, it would still be used widely, but for such practical uses as technology development and simulation. As such, to determine a theory's practical value, we must focus on its real-life ramifications  testable hypotheses, but not necessarily predictions.

From the fundamental Cubic principles, we may broadly define manifestations of Cubic geometry evident in reality. Firstly, that everything is cyclical. In the case of large-scale phenomena, such as cyclicality of galaxy death and rebirth, and that of the universe as a whole, our observational capabilities may not suffice; but on smaller scales, cyclicality certainly is measurable.

A second observable influence is the life that has evolved on Earth, representing an interaction between chaos and Time Cube. Cubic properties are evident in lifeforms  see and Pyramidal Lifeforms, and Systems and Complexities in Nature.""",0.0

Inspirational ending quote:

Juicy

Juicy was an American musical duo consisting of siblings Jerry Barnes and Katreese Barnes. The group is best known for the songs """"Sugar Free"""" and Beat Street feature song """"Beat Street Strut"""". The name comes from Mtume' number-one R&B; hit """"Juicy Fruit"""".

Career
They debuted in 1983 with a single called """"Don't Cha Wanna"""" and album Juicy. The album entered the charts following year. 

In 1984, their song """"Beat Street Strut"""" was released by Atlantic Records. The song appeared on the 1984 musical-drama film Beat Street and its gold-certified soundtrack. The song was moderately successful on Billboard Dance chart, peaking #46 in July 1984. 

In 1985, Juicy recorded their second album It Takes Two, which features an answer record to """"Juicy Fruit"""" called """"Sugar Free"""". It peaked at #13 on the Billboard Black Singles chart and #45 on the UK pop chart, and was certified Gold. Another singles from the album include """"Nobody But You"""", reaching number 59 on the R&B; chart.

After the uncharted album Spread The Love was released in 1987 for CBS Associated Records label, the group did not enter charts any more.

Ermie Smith writes
Æµ§œš¹  You asked me to cite other inaccuracies in the Wikipedia article on Ebonics.  I direct your attention to the Wikipedia article on the “Oakland Ebonics Controversy”.  The Wikipedia article states:  “For students whose primary dialect was AAVE, the Oakland resolution mandated some instruction in that dialect, both for """"maintaining the legitimacy and richness of such language... and to facilitate their acquisition and mastery of English language skills."""" This also included the proposed increase of salaries of those proficient in both AAVE and Standard English to the level of those teaching LEP (limited English proficiency) students and the use of public funding to help teachers learn AAVE themselves.[1]”      This not accurate.  In fact it is an outright lie.   In the first place, the OUSD Board's December 18, 1996, resolution was not about children who speak African American Vernacular English, Black English or any other appellation that implies inherently that the English language is the home, native or primary language of the parents and children that were the specific basis for the Oakland Unified School Districts (OUSD) resolution.  The OUSD December 18, 1996 resolution was concerning children whose parents had identified their home, native or primary language as (1) """"Ebonics"""", (2) """"Pan African Communication Behaviors"""" and/or (3) """"African Language Systems"""".   As proof of this assertion I cite the fact it that the appellations African American Vernacular English does not appear anywhere in the entire OUSD resolution.  In fact the first four Whereas clauses of the OUSD resolution speak only to the existence of a linguistic continuity of the West Niger-Congo African language system in the language of African slave descendants and their unique language stature.   The very first whereas clause of the OUSD resolution states: WHEREAS, numerous validated studies demonstrate that African-American students as part of their culture and history as African people possess and utilize a language described in various scholarly approaches as “Ebonics” (literally Black sounds) or “Pan African Language Communication Behaviors” or “African Language Systems.”  [For more information relative to the appellation “Pan African Language Communication Behaviors” see Pan African Language In The Western Hemisphere (1973)]  The second Whereas clause of the resolution states: “Whereas, these studies have also demonstrated that African language systems have origins in West and Niger-Congo languages  and are not merely dialects of English”.   Now what more evidence does it take to prove that the OUSD resolution was not about African American Vernacular English or any other appellation that implies inherently that the English language is the home, native or primary language of the parents and children that were the basis for the Oakland Unified School Districts (OUSD) resolution?
Here is more.  A critical analysis will reveal that in its very essence the OUSD resolution was about the vindication of the equal protection of the law rights of the Afrocentric parents and their children under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.  That is, the right of English Language Learners (ELL) of African ancestry to not be discriminated against on the basis of their language ancestry and provided instruction in the English language as a second language, i.e.,ESL.  In short, to be provided a Free and Appropriate Public Education.   As proof of this assertion I cite the fifth whereas clause of the OUSD Board's resolution which reads: """"Whereas, judicial cases in states other than California have recognized the unique language stature of African American pupils, and such recognition by courts has resulted in court-mandated educational programs which have substantially benefited African American children in the interest of vindicating their equal protection of the law rights under the Fourteenth Amendment of the  United States Constitution.""""  (See OUSD resolution page 1. para. 5.)  As further evidence that the OUSD Board's resolution was about """"Ebonics"""", """"Pan African Communication Behaviors"""" or """"African Language Systems"""" and not African American Vernacular English, I cite the fact that first ‘Now Therefore Be It Resolved’ clause of the OUSD resolution states: “NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED the Board of Education officially recognizes the existence of, and cultural and linguistic bases of West and Niger -Congo African Languages Systems and these are the language patterns that many African American students bring to school;”  Clearly based on this passage of the resolution what the OUSD Board was addressing was the existence of  """"Ebonics"""", """"Pan African Communication Behaviors"""" or """"African Language Systems"""" and not African American Vernacular English.   The second “Therefore be it resolved” clause of the OUSD resolution states:  “BE IT RESOLVED that the Board of Educ",0.0

Sorry, your code is even unclearer than that in the article. Where did you pull the 18 from, for example? Non-experts of Python won't know that the return format of bin(a) will have a 0b prefix. Note that Python is used here as pseudocode, so it's better to avoid assuming much knowledge of the Python standard library.   

The Python code in the article suffers from two problems:
1) It's unclear what kind of value each variable holds. The variables should either be renamed to something self-descriptive, or a comment should explain the role of each.
2) The code is slightly obscure because it tries to be smart about not recomputing an index expression. Now to explain the algorithm, we don't need optimized code (and an optimizing compiler, which we'd use if efficiency is of any concern, would spot this anyway, so there isn't any reason to even slightly complicate the code even in production).

The code from the ACM Sian article by Chan is much clearer; here's transcribed and commented pseudocode:

def z_order(p, q, d):
    """"Returns true if p < q according to Z-order in d dimensions.
    p and q are supposed to be arrays of d coordinates.""""
    i = 0 # index of most significant dimension
    for j in range(1, d):
        # Use ^ (exclusive or) to eliminate equal bits.
        # msb_is_less will see ones where the coordinates differ.
        if msb_is_less (p[i]^q[i], p[j]^q[j]):
            i = j
    return p[i] < q[i]

def msb_is_less(l, r):
    """"Returns true if the Most Significant Bit of l is less than that of r.""""
    return l <= r or l < l^r # Described as """"neat trick"""" by Chan

Note that the algorithm in the article has """"l < r"""" instead of """"l <= r""""; this changes the result of msb_is_less but I suspect it does not change the result of z_order.

"It appears that Cailil is the only person taking issue with a comments and criticisms section. It is pretty much default procedure for editors to place a comments and criticisms section in articles, particularly regardind articles about corporations. I think Cailil's abuse of admin power is apparent in this case. The fact that he threatens to tag anyone who replaces the comments and criticisms section as a vandal is obvious, and can be seen as an abuse of admin power, voting is the generally accepted way of resolving these disputes yet he has completely ignored this and used his admin power to forward his personal agenda surrouding this article. This here is exactly what is wrong with wikipedia. Admin abuse is about the only flaw in the open source concept and project that is wikipedia. More often admins are seen as using their powers to strike back for bruised egos, or protection of their NON-neutral point of view. Wikipedia is flat out an open source project, and while the Policies are generally adhered to, even Jimmy Wales has left stuff alone when the community demanded it, no matter if it adhered to the policies. The comments and criticisms section needs to be put back into this article, I would do it myself but I cannot find it in the history section.

b)if they fancy them

 moved from My talk page 

This was cut and pasted here since it applies to this article.  

Could someone please tell me where to post the information I have put in the Japanese alias article?  That wording for the notice about Wikibooks: """"Please help improve this article by removing or rewriting the how-to content, which may qualify for a move to Wikibooks."""" is confusing.  If I remove the how-to nature of this article, I can move it to Wikibooks?  I want to leave the how-to nature, and post this somewhere.  My apologies for inappropriately posting it there.  

Hi. Can you tell us which article you want to edit, and what kind of thing you want to add?  ►  

Thanks for your reply.  Sorry, I should have internal linked that.  I want to edit the article Japanese alias.  I have posted the need for sources myself.  However, the other two warnings at the top of the page, in addition to a """"This article or section is written like a personal reflection or essay and may require cleanup."""" warning appear to have come-up automatically.  I would like to resolve these issues.Cheers.  
Rewrite the article to have a more neutral tone. Phrases like """"The best way to determine an alias is to take several months..."""" read more like a how-to than an article. See WP:BETTER for more information as well.  and his otters • (Broken clamshells•Otter chirps) 

(my own opinion on this) - I hope you don't decide to take it elsewhere; it has the beginnings of a good wiki article. Don't be dismayed by the boxes at the top. Most people here want to make the encyclopedia better, and are posting their thoughts on that basis. Ok, there will always be a few that disparage anything, but...ride with it.

I am now going to read the article more fully, and post further comments when I have. I sincerely hope that will help you develop the article. I will post them in about 10 mins from now.  ►  

Thanks for your help and your encouragement.  Are those warnings appearing automatically, or is that someone's judgment?  If the latter, I would be glad to consult them for advice too.  If that is possible, please let me know how. Wiki on!  

Re. warnings, who - I'll check into them and get back to you shortly. In the meantime, here's some hastily-written scribbles;

Lead - that is, the first bit, before the 'purpose' section starts: Explain what is meant by an alias, use synonymns for 'alias', don't repeat it. Remember the 'lead' should not contain any info that is not in the body of the article - it's a summary. Which is why I suggest leaving it until last - write the whole thing, THEN make the lead to summarise the content.

The wikihelp says to use the article title in the first bit, but I have edited it some.  Thanks.  

Re. Alien ID - from a quick search, I can't find an article about alien registration cards - I'm very suprised. Maybe there is one. There should be. You shouldn't need an external link; 

If not, I'd be very tempted to create one! Even if just a stub saying what they are, where to get one (ku office etc), why it's a good idea (not need passport etc)

But search thoroughly first - no point re=inventing the wheel!

"""::I am surprised you dispute whether or not the Analects contain music criticism when this is so widely written about. Your criticism of Steben’s 2010 paper, “The Philosophy of Music and Ritual in Pre-Han Confucian Thought” http://www.academia.edu/1929545/The_Philosophy_of_Music_and_Ritual_in_Pre-Han_Confucian_Thought_Exalting_the_Power_of_Music_in_Human_Life) for not using the word “criticism” is as unsupportable as your insistence on the word “theory.” Lest we devolve into absurd arguments about the definition of “criticism,” In general, the word is defined as “The action of criticizing, or passing judgment on the qualities or merits of anything….” (The Philological Society, ed. The Oxford English Dictionary, Vol II C, Oxford at the Clarendon Press, 1970, p.1181). With regard to music specifically, “The Oxford Companion to Music” defines it, in specific regard to music, as: “…the intellectual activity of formulating judgments on the value and degree of excellence of individual works of music, or whole groups or genres.”(Latham, ed. Oxford University Press, 2002, p.324) Steben’s paper then clearly describes Confucius’ criticism. As another example, WP’s article on Yayue refers to Confucius’ writing: “The term yayue itself first appeared in the Analects,[2][3] where yayue was considered by Confucius to be the kind of music that is good and beneficial, in contrast to the popular music originated from the state of Zheng which he judged to be decadent and corrupting.[4][5] Yayue is therefore regarded in the Confucian system as the proper form of music that is refined, improving, and essential for self-cultivation, and one that can symbolize good and stable governance.[6][7] “ The Analects contain music criticism whether the word “criticism” appears or not. I think you may be the only person around who thinks otherwise. In the future, if you make assertions like, “You claim that """"Confucius' Analects is, in regard to music, criticism""""; but the reference that you quote in support of your claim utterly fails to actually support it, because it merely never speaks of criticism,” please cite a reference to support your argument. Your continuing argument that a thing cannot be accepted as theoretical unless it specifically uses the word “theory” is similarly problematic because it is not supported anywhere that I can find. Throughout or discussion, I’ve pointed you to references that contradict your personal opinion. If you have a reference for your opinion, please cite. Jacques Bailhé

"Those claims were reinserted with sources, but the sources themselves were problematic and I have again removed that material. I do not know Portuguese, but this article fails to support some of the more lurid claims made in a paragraph about some explicit videotapes (phrases cited do not appear at all in that source). I'm not certain, but it seems possible that the article does not discuss the controversy at all, as from what I can gather it basically is discussing his work. This appears to be a primary document and is the sole source for a controversial claim about his professional life, though Taveira is discussed on that page, and the claim could be true. We cannot go off of primary sources for that kind of thing though.

The BLP issues here are significant, as are questions of weight, since most of the previous version of the article was given over to controversy rather than a discussion of his career. Please do not re-add the material in question without discussing it here on the talk page (I'd also appreciate a note on my talk page if such a discussion begins, though I have watchlisted this). We almost certainly need better sources, and we also need help from Portuguese-speaking editors.  | talk |  contribs",0.0

(See, above) Mr. Harris argues the beliefs there was a plot to kill the president, and that Oswald was set up, is similar to believing the earth is flat. 

No Mr. Harris, you are out of step with the modern world. In 1979, a Congressional Committee engaged in a three year study and determined that Kennedy was probably murdered as a result of a conspiracy, and in 2003 only 22% of Americans agree with you. Mr. Harris, you are clinging to the past in the face of overwhelming information to the contrary that is slowly being made public as more and more documents are declassified.  Sometimes one has to question old beliefsnot try to delete facts from books that disprove ones old beliefs. 

Congress enacted federal legislation in 1992 to open up the mass of secret government records about the assassination. The Assassination Records Review Board points out that not many people agree with Mr. Harris:

""""The American public has expressed its dissatisfaction with both the work and the conclusions of the official investigations of the assassination and it was this dissatisfaction that was primarily responsible for Congress' initiative to establish the Assassination Records Review Board (Review Board). Section 3(2) of the JFK Act defines the records of each of these official investigative entities as assassination records. As such, the Review Board worked to review and release all records that these investigative entities used in reaching their conclusions about the assassination.""""

Mr. Harris it won't help you cause to argue that everyone but you is dumb, a """"flat-earth believer"""", or must be sheltered from the facts. Please, just stop deleting facts from the articles. The old viewpoint that you want to believe is in the article. But, you’re not
satisfied. You want to keep out the evidence that makes your position to look improbable, but the web site rules forbid you deleting such information.

"Dutch flag 

The French flag was not inspired by the flag of the Netherlands. This theory put forward by an anonymous user repeatedly in the last days is simply not supported by any proof and seems to be only a (chauvinistic?) guess from that anonymous user. Actually, ironically, I found out that it seems the Netherlands designed their flag in the 17th century based on the blue-white-red colors of the Bourbon of France. According to the French Wikipedia it is King Henry IV of France who suggested these colors to the newly independent Netherlands. Finally, the Netherlands did not have borders with France at the time of the Revolution as the anonymous user wrote. France had borders with the Austrian Low Countries, but not with the independent Netherlands.
 30 June 2005 11:06 (UTC)

The original colours of the Dutch flag were orange, white and blue. King Henry V of France did not suggest to the Netherlands to use red, white and blue. The Dutch started using red because the orange colour was unstable in flag making.

This is not chauvinism. Here are some sources:

 Comment 

My comments on Malleus' talk page were well beyond civil, even for a user talk page. They were a personal attack, and warranted serious sanction. 

For the record, it was a simple spontaneous eruption of contempt mingled with rage. Some have muttered that I went to his page to harass him; that's not the case. I went to continue a discussion that had been interrupted by earlier admin action. Some are muttering that I went there to """"bait"""" or """"poke"""" him into a block. I appreciate the complement but my Machiavellian intelligence is non-existant. Obviously. 

I lost respect for Malleus when he said, """"You already succeeded in getting me blocked, so I can only presume that you're trying to repeat the trick."""" I had made it clear that I had no intention of getting him blocked, he knew it, and yet regurgitated this populist slur. That's where he opened the door for my unmitigated opinion.

But my rant wasn't aimed at the dishonesty I perceived in that comment, that simply gave me permission to express a much deeper revulsion that's been building in me over the last few months with respect to this project. 

It's a feeling, so I'm not sure I can make it clear. A kind of nauseous disgust. It's to do with how we deal with the hurt we may cause others, other editors, our subjects and our readers. I'm pleased to see the faltering steps being taken toward a more civil ethos here. Those who actually know me know that means a great deal to me. There is a long way to go. Pesky pointed out that finding the right form of words for what's required is difficult. I agree. That's the challenge. The right form of words will emerge if we discuss these questions enough.

With regard to respectful discourse between editors, Malleus has been addressing the real root of the civility problem here for years. Telling someone to fuck off, or calling them a cunt is obviously uncivil and an easy call for an admin. But the real evil here is not Malleus and me calling each other names, it's the sleazy aside from one editor to another, undermining the reputation of a third. One editor can bully or badger another for days or weeks without ever calling them a name, and it's their victim that cops a block when they respond accordingly. So I'm glad to see more admins taking civility seriously, but you're going to have to work on the sophistication of your approach.

I'm disgusted by the way this project treats its readers with regard to controversial images. The bit that disgusts me is the mantra that """"we don't care if we offend our readers."""" Seriously. That has been repeated ad nauseam during the Muhammad images debates and others. I can see no excuse for that attitude, and don't want to participate in an enterprise that has that attitude towards its readership.

And finally, contempt for our subjects. I first noticed this on a BLP. A teenage girl and her boyfriend made a sex tape. Later, when she was a minor local celebrity, the tape was posted on the net, without her permission. It's there now; Google her name and """"sex tape"""" and you got it. She's now won a TV competition, so is becoming better known.

The tape's existence has been mentioned a few times in the press, but not much, and usually the """"nudge, nudge, lucky bastard"""" type of comment, but it doesn't seem to have affected her career or even her private life. An RfC asked """"Should we mention the tape?"""" Policy-wise you can make a case for its inclusion, but it's borderline. What really disgusted me was the utter unconcern of many editors for the effect our inclusion of the factoid would have on the visibility of the tape, and the consequent effect this would have on the woman. I won't elaborate further; you either get it or you don't.

And it was concern for the subject of a BLP that brought Malleus and me together. He was arguing for the preservation of a borderline notable BLP that the subject said was distressing him. I argued that it should go, simply because it's borderline notable and the subject doesn't want it. 

Although Malleus asserted the wishes of the subject are irrelevant, an assertion he is incapable of justifying, and a position I find morally repugnant, he deemed it appropriate to also declare the subject's claim of distress is implausible. Unfortunately, Jimbo had already primed me with a similar judgment. Jimbo had ignored my response, so I thought I'd add a little emphasis when I explained my view to Malleus.

"FK Vardar 

FK Vardar is a Macedonian Football club, the club changed its name several times during its history, from original Vardar in 1911 to Citizens Football Club Vardar or just Citizens( Gragjanski in Macedonian ) in 1920, then Football Club Makedonija in 1946 and finally back to FC Vardar in 1947. By the name FC Citizens( Vardar ) the club won 4 championships from 1936 till 1939. About Yugoslavia, you have to know that Yugoslavia was a federation of 6 Republics -countries together and each Republic had its own championship, and there was a Federal League where teams from the Republics competed together. Each Republic had its own Cup and the cup winners competed in the Marshals Cup, that cup was held in honor of Joseph Broz the marshal of the Federation, and its was called the Cup of the Marshal. How ever FC Vardar never won the Federal league ( League made of Federation of 6 Republics best teams ,thats why its called the Federal League, and not Yugoslavian League nor Yugoslavian Cup). The title in 1987 was won by FC Partizan Belgrade , you can check in any official statistics or documents. The second federal league was made of two Second Federal Leagues , East ( 3 Republics competed, Serbia ,Monte Negro,Macedonia and two Provinces- almost the same as Republics but yet without a nation ,those were Kosovo and Vojvodinship ) and West ( 3 Republics, Croatia, Bosnia and Slovenia, sometimes clubs from province Vojvodinship  would compete in the West depending on the federation decisions ). In the period of 1922 till 1929, present day Republic of Macedonia was established as 4 provinces within the Kingdom of Serbs Croats and Slovenes, those 4 provinces were Skopje, Bitola,Shtip and Vranje prvinces. These 4 provinces established the Macedonian Football Federation in 1926,and they held 3 championships. In 1929 these 4 provinces joined in one Duchy and this championship was held in the Duchy ( Banovina ) for 11 times.During the WW2 the championship was held under German Occupation, and the German government recognized this League. After the WW2 the very same championship was tranformed in to Republic Football League ,just the Province of Vranje was separated from the Republic as Macedonia transformed from Duchy to a Republic and the province of Vranje was under the newly made Republic of Serbia in 1946. The bottom line is since the Federation of 6 Republics split in the 90s, Macedonian Republic League was transformed in to Macedonian First League. So it is the same League that changed names and competition format during the decades, and now it came to this Level. Its a petty that there is lots of politics and territorial pretensions lots of denial of the existence of the Macedonia and other Republics in the Federation , by the Serbian side. Serbian official politic is to show that Yugoslavia was one country and nation mainly based on Serb character and they are stilling all the history including history of sports in this case football. They are trying to show the world that there was Yugoslav nation ( Serb ) and only Yugoslav Football league ( Serb League ) denying the Federal League second Federal League and Republic Leagues. They want to show only Yugoslav League and not the real Federal League. They hold all the champions from the Federal League as Serbian Champions in every competition. For FC Vardar at this point of view considering that  Macedonia is not in the Federetion for more than 20 years,and it wont be in the future ,the most important are the titles and trophies won in the Macedonian League , and if you wont to put additional trophies won in the Federation ,the period before 1991 you should write the precise information. Second Federal League East is the name of the competition, and you should put the Macedonian Flag from that period of the time next to it,instead of the federal flag, simply because that federation dont exist anymore and doesnt represent any country nor nation. About the cup , you should write down the real proper name as it was called ,Marshals Cup also fallowed by Macedonian flag from that period of the time, you should put a notice that in the Federal Second League East , clubs from Serbia Macedonia and Monte Negro competed including the provinces of Kosovo i Vojvodinship.",0.0

The title quote would lead up that block.  Now, to do that with the existing S pages would take a loooot of work, so the easy way is to either do trivia (adding length to page), add to the episode summary (eg 'Episode 1 """"Wow, this is Survivor"""" (John)"""": blah blah blah'), or add to where they already are (in the episode summary table).

""""At what point does an editor here pass your threshold for what constitutes a non-newbie?"""" As for Delta/Triangle (sorry, I don't know how to make triangles on my keyboard), I concluded at the time that he was a newbie for the reasons I mentioned above. It was an explanation of my perception at the time, and not some type of value judgment. But if you really want an answer to your question, I'd say an editor is no longer a newbie when they have a reasonable command of how Wikipedia works, such that they do not make false accusations of copyright infringement, make a point of communicating with image uploaders, and familiarize themselves with the right way to communicate with members of the community.

""""If you believe images should be retained without there being a rationale for that use present..."""" Thank you for making it clear that you either are not reading my messages, or are being deliberately churlish. I didn't say anything about images being retained without a rationale. I already explained clearly above the matter regarding the rationale, and if you're either too illiterate or too lazy to read and comprehend this, then perhaps you should not engage me in discussion.

I made the edit summary that I thought was appropriate, as I'm quite tired of obnoxious deletionists like Triangle who make false accusations and no attempt to communicate with others, as well as persistent liars like yourself who think repeatedly putting words in other people's mouths constitutes """"discussion"""".

Thank you for participating in my """"RecFA"""", which passed with a final tally of 153/39/22.

I wish to note how humbled I was when I read 's support comment, although a fair majority gave me great pleasure. I would also note those whose opposes or neutral were based in process concerns and who otherwise commented kindly in regard to my record.I recognise that the process itself was unusual, and the format was generally considered questionable - and I accept that I was mistaken in my perception of how it would be received - but I am particularly grateful for those whose opposes and neutrals were based in perceptions of how I was not performing to the standards expected of an administrator.

'New' articles

I'm intending to make separate articles for each class as already exist at the german wikipedia.

Main reasons are:
I didn't find half as much info as I wanted in the article - hence I want to expand them
If I expand this article for all the classes it might become very long.
I also found the non-numerical treatment of the classes a bit confusing.

Once these articles are made this article could act as a hub - (perhaps renamed """"DB V160 family"""" or similar), or the article could be deleted.

First of all, you don't know crap about Vietnam.

Secondly, of course many (actual) rebels were local residents, i.e. of KBR. But as of the bodies, some/most of them belonged to innocent civilians who were killed in crossfire (like even the KBR president said). Here's about the mechanism of this:

""""This is a commonplace in Chechnya. I have not been to Nalchik and I do not know this case, but it is quite possible that such things happen there too. Well, basically, they happen throughout entire Russia, only specifics are different — drugs or weapons are planted in order to jail one or get paid for closing a case,"""" an officer of the Department for the Combating of Organised Crime and Terrorism of the Russian Internal Affairs Ministry told Caucasian Knot's correspondent. """"Of course, civilians sometimes die in Chechnya and in other North Caucasus republics, too, where counter-terrorist activities are conducted, and weapons are planted on them by officers that are not the most conscientious. But one should understand that they do so not because they want to register another victory for themselves, but for fear that they can be jailed for good because of this accidental killing."""" According to the officer, one should not say that """"someone is killed on purpose and then registered as a rebel. Only Kadyrovtsy do so. It is not a custom among us, federals.""""

And actually indeed some time later a group of Kadyrov's policemen (called """"a gang"""") were persecuted precisely for this, that is killing random people (few men and a woman they kidnapped and killed) and then planting guns and explosives on them for promotions.

transgressing the boundaries eh? Shall we deconstruct, so to speak, the transformitive hermeneutics you've inserted into the lead of Causality:
""""...There is also a significant body of literature on this subject in the sciences, including the influential work of Bohr who noted that causality was incompatible with the alteration of what is observed by the act of observation itself, certainly for descriptions at the atomic and sub-atomic level,[3] and possibly in other arenas as well.[4]""""

WP:GAME Lying to readers may be easier, but see WP:Quote#General guidelines: """"Never quote a false statement without immediately saying the statement is false... There is no difference between quoting a falsehood without saying it's false and inserting falsehoods into articles."""" Bohr typically refers to classical mechanics as causality, and he stipulates a fundamental necessity that """"observations"""", (the results of scientific experiment), must be described in classical terms (the terms of complimentary pairs require different experimental arrangements). It's well know that his fundamentalist epistemology lacked merit, and although Bohr was under no pressure to demonstrate the merits of complimentarity, had it genuinely been a new means of scientific description, it could have been generalized to the other sciences... to which Bohr vaguely alluded, but never sufficiently elaborated.

In any case Depardieu has not renounced French citizenship   
This article/reference disagrees with that: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2251340/Adieu-France-Gerard-Depardieu-lands-Rome-renouncing-French-citizenship.html -  
 You shouldn't trust rags like The Daily Mail… (212.7.192.145  )
Seriously, i don't know why i even try. Next you know, all newspapers are """"rags"""" and diplomatic sources such as the Kremlin website are not reliable... Oh wait... We already went to that stage. -  
 As I explained above, the Daily Mail  - a notoriously unreliable English newspaper - 's article is from 20 December and is talking about the earlier controversy about Depardieu saying he was going to renounce French nationality.  It was impossible for this to be true since he did not have any other nationality to fall back on.    

Alledgely claims by Depardieu's Agent

Will the honourable gentleman behind IP 87.67.143.211 post ANY KIND OF SOURCE to back his claim, or will you just continue vandalizing the article and removing content and references? -  

Depardieu is a French actor having his legal residence in Belgium. That's all for the moment

1. France did not remove Depardieu's citizenship yet (otherwise, where is the source?).

2. Depardieu never applied for Russian citizenship.

3. Ask your Prof. of International Law (I did).

4. See here: http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/filmstar-gerard-depardieu-von-putin-zum-russen-ernannt-a-875537.html): “Die Formulierung des Kreml, wonach Depardieu einen Antrag auf Einbürgerung gestellt hatte, wurde von einem Assistenten des Schauspielers dementiert.“

In English: The formulation of the Kremlin, that Depardieu had filed an application for naturalization, was denied by an assistant of the actor.

So yes: the Kremlin lied.

5. Lock this article once and for all for the rest of the month.

6. Ask yourself: If tomorrow, every country of the world offer Depardieu a passport, what do you do? Will you consider he's a Afghanisto-Albanio-Algerio-Andorro-Angolo-Antiguo-Barbudo-Argentino-Armenio-Australio-Austrio-Azerbaijo-Bahamo-Bahro-Banglado-Barbado-Belaro-Belgo-Belizo-Benino-Bhutano-Bolivio-………-Zambio-Zimbabwean actor?

I think Clockback that your suggested reference to Ainsworth’s involvement in the IMG is too long and that something along the lines of ‘brief flirtation’ would be better. I think that the IMG reference needs to be short/somewhere in the early career section/posted after the article has been expanded a little, otherwise the article might appear weighty. I think the last point is important as it seemed to be a consensus reached by a number of Wikipedia editors after much wrangling and gnashing of teeth))

But bedsides, this brief dalliance with Marxism, in an overall consideration of his political career, pales into insignificance compared to his being controversially thrust as a third choice candidate into the position of Defence Secretary at a time of crisis for the British Army in terms of the number of casualties being sustained and a lack of resources. This is simply not reflected at all in the Ainsworth article. I tried reflecting it as follows: """"His appointment formed part of a chaotic cabinet reshuffle by the Prime Minister, who """"considered at least three other candidates before appointing Ainsworth"""" but this was dismissed as """"speculative opinion"""" by Off2riorob above, even though from my point of view it is easily the most significant event in Ainsworth’s biography. Perhaps we can reach a consensus that if a better reference can be found—which I suspect should not be difficult—that it can be re-included? I want to stress that this is again not meant to be an ad hominem slight against Ainsworth, but merely drawing attention to the fact that his appointment was the equivalent of throwing someone in at the deep end (and indeed he has had a very difficult time of it since his appointment). Actually it reflects worse on Brown and the farcical reshuffle.  """,0.0

So we're back at the point we were before - is there something special about the relationship between Hagos and Biasutti that allows this transfer of expertise just by citation? My point is that it takes years of training, experience and recognition by others in the field to be considered an expert in that field. You seem to be saying Hagos got it just by citing Biasutti. If David Attenborough cited Niels Bohr would he become an expert in Physics? No he wouldn't, he'd just be an expert in biology who happened to cite an expert in physics once - we wouldn't be able to accept anything he said about quantum mechanics or block holes as fact until we checked it with a genuine expert in the field. So what makes you think Hagos has become an expert in human skin colour just by citing Biasutti? And remember that the policy doesn't just state """"expert"""",  it states """"established expert in the topic whose previous work in the field has been published by reliable third-party publications"""" - unless you are you going to argue that Hagos got Biasutti's reputation and previous publications as well I think this is a dead end argument. You should accept that Hagos doesn't meet the criteria laid down by the WP policy for the creators of self-published sources.
If you don't think that Hagos chose the colours for each country then who do you think did it? They didn't just magically change due to """"migration trends"""" - somebody made a decision that colour X goes in country Y. From the evidence we have it would appear that Hagos was the one who made that decision - it certainly wasn't made by Biasutti or the writers of the national census data that he cites as his sources.
It makes no difference to the situation so I won't argue it, but for the record I don't accept that Hagos is a recognised expert on migration.

If (1): As I have already clarified, the GA criteria indicate that those articles should be either improved to bring them up to legitimate GA status, or reassessed. CurtisNaito's track record of OWNership and edit-warring indicates that the former is impossible, leaving the latter option. Reassessing those articles would be in accordance with content policy, and I wasn't actually threatening to do so anyway; I was threatening not to do so. In my two years of arguing with CurtisNaito, I have in all but one occasion (the Emperor Jimmu article) chosen the carrot over the stick.
:If (2): You should express that opinion in an appropriate forum like an article talk page or the currently open History of Japan GAR. Blocking one side of a content dispute because you happen to agree with the other is inappropriate, especially when the other side has explicitly violated an ANI final warning numerous times over the past two weeks. (Note that I don't actually think this is why you blocked me. I'm grabbing at straws.)Sorry. Just noticed this.  (聖やや) 
If (3): You may be right, but look what I have had to deal with: CurtisNaito has requested four times in the last five months, on both ANI and ArbCom, that I be site-banned for disagreeing with his edits, even though pretty much everyone else disagrees with them too. If there's a hostile editing environment, I'm not the one to blame. And as in (1) above, it was not a threat anyway  I was offering a favour in exchange for CurtisNaito granting me the favour of not requesting that I be site-banned anymore. If this is what you meant, it's a good faith misunderstanding, and I will try to avoid such misunderstandings in the future, but I should still be unblocked.
If (4): Tell me the policy. I won't violate it again. I also won't appeal the block, though, since I've been here too long for ignorance of the rules to be a valid excuse.

 BLP, ethnicity, gender 

Remember a couple of years back, when I tried a common subpage for both policy and guidelines? And you objected, so we split them back up?

Well, as I predicted, they've diverged over time. And now the wiki-lawyers are arguing that """"policy"""" trumps """"guidelines"""".  Since the BLP policy doesn't specifically mention Ethnicity and Gender, while at least a half dozen guidelines do, it's been disrupting WP:CFD, and WP:EGRS, and quite a bit else.

Could you take a look at the main (above), and see whether you support adding Ethnicity and Gender into the policy?

And do you know of anywhere that the Policy and Guidelines has language about precedence?

I want a big, strong man to beat me up whilst another muscular hunk restrains me and whispers obscenities into my innocent little ear.  I especially like it when I am called 'a cum-guzzling, dick-sucking, fellating, felching, shit-sniffing, nigger-worshipping, homosexual man-slut,' for I know, in my heart, that this description of me is extremely accurate.  Please, big, hairy men, I want to be your ass-slave, serving you and satisfying you with my bunghole for as long as my submissive soul remains in this world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1111one1111won11  I will even pay you large sums of money if that is necessary.

Someone in WP management needs to look at the Barbara Biggs entry, as it seems to my amateur eyes to be largely an advertizement of Biggs books, and a beat-up of her deeds and status based on what is written in same self-authored books. There are some references to media who interviewed her about her books/deeds but these again rested mostly on her own opinions about herself drawn from her self-authored books. Is there not supposed to be independant verification of her claims? 58.165.69.67

I was hoping you would agree to fill out a brief survey about your experience. This study aims to help expand our thinking about collaborative knowledge production. Believe me I share your likely disdain for surveys but your participation would be immensely helpful in making the study a success. A link to the survey is included below.

Second of all, the book reference is the one to be used, PROMUSICAE be damned or not. Thirdly, hung medien is NOT the official site for old song in Spain, they post from 2004 onwards. And using both the book as well as the  template with the same reference name as """"spain"""" gives a reference error. And """"One usually doesn't change formats, especially in GAs"""" is not a reason for keeping errorneous false templates. — [ ChitChat ] """,0.14285714285714285

Speedy deletion of Gjendemsfjellet
 A tag has been placed on Gjendemsfjellet requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.    (Talk)  """,0.0

Try as I might, I'm not really able to associate your Zebra analogy with this article. For it to work, this would have to be an article about the colour white, and even then it doesn't really work. The purpose of my change is to remove the """"comparison"""" nature of the section. It's not meant to be a comparison to begin with. The problem right now is that the section really violates NPOV - it places weight on a comparison with another format, rather than standing by itself. The fact it mentions Blu-ray means we have a somewhat unnecessary argument going on in the Talk: pages about a graph which is exclusively focussed on comparing Blu-ray and HD DVD studio support. 

To be NPOV, this part of the article needs to focus on what support HD DVD has. Issues such as what proportion of the studios support it are obviously relevant. Issues as to whether they support either of the competing formats (incumbent DVD, as well as Blu-ray) aren't really, except insofar as it should be mentioned that the rivaly exists.

We need to move the fanboi """"HD DVD is better"""", """"No, Blu-ray is better!"""", """"Well, HD DVD has more support!"""", """"No, Blu-ray has more support!"""" crap to the comparison articles.   18:13, 21""",0.0

"""

You've made three mistakes:
 
Is the version I'd reverted to - unstable? On the contrary: the version that you were attempting to revert to - is unstable, because the chapter you'd removed, was added three years ago (on 5 May 2008), and lasted until 14 March 2011, i.e. until the day before yestreday, whereas the version you were attempting to revert to - lasted for less than 40 hours only - that were uncontinuous and broken, so which version is more stable?
Returning the chapter you'd removed - is not against the consensus at all. The chapter is supported by User:(MOB)DeadMeat, and is also supported by User:Chrishatch1973, and is also supported by User:Eliko; whereas the removal of the chapter is supported by User:Basket of Puppies only. Really, it was also supported (in the past) by User:DragonflySixtyseven, however their reason for the removal - was refuted on their talk page (and on the article talk page as well), and they didn't respond to the refutation. According to the law: Silence gives consent, the very fact that User:DragonflySixtyseven didn't respond to the refutation - shows that User:DragonflySixtyseven does not reject the explanation given on their talk page (and on the article talk page as well) for returning the chapter. To sum up, three editors (User:(MOB)DeadMeat, User:Chrishatch1973 and User:Eliko) support the chapter, and one single user (User:Basket of Puppies) rejects it, so which option is more consensual? Returning the chapter, or removing it?
The chapter you removed is relevant, as I'd explained on the article talk page - before you removed the chapter. If you think the chapter is irrelevant - despite my explanation (on the article talk page) why it's relevant, then please discuss that on the article talk page.

Note that when you responded to me on my talk page - each one of us had made one revert only - during 2011, so: considering that the single revert I've made during 2011 - was sufficient for you to warn me of your reporting me for WP:3RR and edit-warring - if I """"continue to revert"""", also your single revert you've made during 2011 - should be sufficient for me to warn you of my reporting you for WP:3RR and edit-warring - if you """"continue to revert"""".
If you continue to both - remove a consensual chapter - and replace it by an unstable version which is against the consensus, then I will report you for violating Wikipedia policy, that requires - to discuss everything on the article talk page - before removing a consensual chapter and before replacing it by an unstable version which is against the consensus.
Anyways: due to your claim about irrelevance, I will add to the (stable consensual) chapter - some clarifications, to make sure that every reader (including User:Basket of Puppies) understands its relevance.

Granted there are one mention of Wendy McAuliffe and its in the Ankit Fadia article but there are 35,700 results for """"Wendy McAuliffe"""" ZDNet in Google, and at her current venture about page http://www.populatedigital.com/people/ mentions """"Wendy began her career as a journalist for ZDNet, the UK’s leading online technology newswire, during which time she became a leading authority in online privacy and child protection online."""" so that's another unreliable sources?!?

Surely an article about Ankit Fadia by Suelette Dreyfus is a reliable source, but you nixed that too.

You point to the notability page and revert the page, and I see in that document that Wikipedia is not a promotional medium, the way that article is after you revert the page, it turns into a promotional medium for Ankit Fadia, without the other articles supporting that Ankit Fadia is a phony, then have the issue of unclear notability to which having an article about Ankit Fadia. If notability requires verifiable evidence, how many mainstream and researched articles pointing out are needed to point out that Ankit Fadia is a verifiable phony?

 Go to the image description page and edit it to add {{Replaceable fair use disputed}}, without deleting the original Replaceable fair use template.
 On the image discussion page, write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all.

Alternatively, you can also choose to replace the fair use image by finding a freely licensed image of its subject, requesting that the copyright holder release this (or a similar) image under a free license, or by taking a picture of it yourself.

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified how these images fully satisfy our fair use criteria.

 Fair use images and original article 

I don't understand this neurotic compulsion that people seem to have to scrap all of my contributions to this article.  The third paragraph that was previously removed, and which I have now reinstated, contains relevant description for this article.  Similar descriptions appear in other porn-related articles on wikipedia.  As for the pictures, the lead image is a promotional photo head shot and it is a much better representation of the subject than an amateur fan pic.  The """"Helles Belles"""" image illustrates relevant text in the article.  In fact, fair use rationales and appropriate licensing tags have been provided for both of these images.  I don't understand what the problem is since both images are regularly used for promotional purposes by the copyright holder to market Laura Angel and products related to her.  Thus, the appearance of these same images on wikipedia is altogether fair and appropriate as an accurate visual representation of the subject.  Also, both of the images I have added to this article are much more characteristic of Laura's professional appearance than the Brussels fan pic.

"Sure they're subjective - they're rhetorical: I was arguing a case. I still think that the single arrival point (article to which all others direct) should be the most neutral. I believe that that, when dealing with periods in the past, should be assumed to be the title used in the subject's own time (necessarily adjusted for the English language, in an E Lang encyclopedia) - here, Philip the Tetrarch. The Herod Philips have to be there, because people will search for them. These pages should note that there is disagreement about the use of the name and that there is very little firm evidence surviving from that time, and then send the seeker to the historical name. If someone with more knowledge than my own adds a note to the effect that 'Theologians use ... and historians use ...', that would be a welcome addition. This means that all the terms would be in wikipedia; they would all be findable; and there would be a central page which would contain all relevant information, and I trust everything that any user of an encyclopedia might want. I don't want to MOVE any pages, just tidy up the way of finding them. I don't think this is as strong an advice as you do; more of a signpost (perhaps a better image than 'guide'?)

 My Statement 

Oh wow, I take a little drive and come back to a nuclear war zone? I guess I can take on each point...

 The fact that MF was not blocked for the same behavior is rather odd (also... if you ask a question after telling me to stop replying... what do you really expect?).
 I agree that Tan needed to be blocked and I agree with the desysopping. 
 To say that I have no right to be angry is a foolhardy notion. I was told multiple times to fuck off (btw, when told to fuck off, I am considerably less likely to comply).
 . They both hail from the infamous Tiscali network. That being said, rpeh has no reason to be involved in this discussion (he has a personal issue with me ever since he was desysopped on another wiki; he hasn't gotten over it). I intend to request a checkuser and request a block for sockpuppetry.
 User:Georgewilliamherbert places too much weight on unofficial warnings. A vandal can be warned four times but a user once? Hmmmm...
 Prodego has no reason to be desysopped. He had every right to block for a violation of WP:NPA tens of times.

I'ld like to retrieve one small item from the above hidden stuff. Martin's remark """"the answer is 2/3"""" and mine, """"no, the answer is switch"""". I did not mean to imply that the 2/3 should be made completely invisible. Of course one must emphasize that a good *reason* to switch is because the probability is 2/3 that you'll get the car this way. It is even a very very good reason to switch, since it is can be shown (if all doors are initially equally likely to hide the car) that you can't do better; in particular, complicated strategies of sometimes switching sometimes staying depending on specific door numbers lead to a smaller chance of success! (Morgan et al; Gill).

I hoped that this remark of mine would help show that by careful choice of words it's possible to write sentences which many more editors could agree with. And which everyone can agree are not misleading and which everyone can agree reflects what is in the literature.

Remember: Vos Savant and Whitaker ask what the player should do. Introducing probabilities into the story is one way of finding justification for an action. The phrase """"the probability"""" leads straight to controversy, at least to disagreement (both among editors and in the literature). The phrase """"what action should the player take"""" leads to concensus (both among editors and in the literature). 

It's just meant to be a small, practical concensus building suggestion!

 You should wait for others to write an article about subjects in which you are personally involved. This applies to articles about you, your achievements, your business, your publications, your website, your relatives, and any other possible conflict of interest. 

Creating an article about yourself is strongly discouraged. If you create such an article, it might be listed on articles for deletion. Deletion is not certain, but many feel strongly that you should not start articles about yourself. This is because independent creation encourages independent validation of both significance and verifiability. All edits to articles must conform to Wikipedia:No original research, Wikipedia:Neutral point of view, and Wikipedia:Verifiability. 

If you are not """"notable"""" under Wikipedia guidelines, creating an article about yourself may violate the policy that Wikipedia is not a personal webspace provider and would thus qualify for speedy deletion.  If your achievements, etc., are verifiable and genuinely notable, and thus suitable for inclusion in Wikipedia, someone else will probably create an article about you sooner or later.

"Hello, Deval khandelwal, and welcome to Wikipedia! Thank you for your contributions.

I notice that one of the first articles you created  appears to be an article about yourself. This is a common mistake made by new Wikipedians—as this is an encyclopedia, we wouldn't expect to have an article about every contributor. Your user page, however, is a great place to write about yourself, making sure to stay within user page guidelines. Just click your user name at the top of the screen when you are logged in, and edit it normally.

The page you created about yourself has been or will shortly be speedily deleted from Wikipedia, but if you want to use the content from it, don't hesitate to ask anyone from this list and they will copy it to your user page.

If you are stuck, and looking for help, please come to the New contributors' help page, where experienced Wikipedians can answer any queries you have! Or, you can just type  on your user page, and someone will show up shortly to answer your questions. Here are a few other good links for newcomers:

 Link to Article: """"The Unknown Martin Luther King, Jr.""""  

This link Article: """"The Unknown Martin Luther King, Jr."""" has twice been removed by one particular editor, first with a remark in including the words """"What's next? a link to Stormfront?"""" which I do not understand, and later to dismissing the link as """"racist"""", which like many convenience-words ending in """"ist"""" can be defined to mean whatever the user intends it to mean (often a derogatory and empowering substitute for lack of intellingent reasoned discussion).  I do not think the link is one to be treated as vandalism, which I am sorry must be common in any article about a well-known leader.  The subject matter of the linked article does not seem to be concerned with expression of a particular point of view on race (if this is what """"racist"""" means): if it did it would not be relevant to the MLK page.  But it does seem to be biographical, has some nice photographs, and is well-written and reasonable, and therefore of interest.  As an experienced (non-American, with no point of view on the subject of the article) contributor to wikipedia, I believe a variety of appropriate links to a subject is of interest, and contributes to understanding.  And a variety of independent views expressed of a subject enriches, and is the way to approach the truth, like any scientific research: it is not for editors to filter links because they contain matter showing the subject to be less than perfect - we are all human - and I can understand that this might be the reason.

Enough.  Please can there be viewpoints on the relevance of the link to MLK ?  And consensus.  Welcome from the editor mentioned above and others.  Thanks.    
We don't link to fringe sites such as AmRen without a very good reason, and there isn't one here; the article in question is an opinion piece by a non-notable grad student, and is of no particular value to the article. Sorry you don't like the term """"racist"""", but it's an appropriate description for Amren. This article gets a vast amount of racist vandalism  that's why it's semi-protected  and non-vandalism pointing to racist sources is immediately and properly suspect. ∇∆∇∆ 15:""",0.0

 Hypocrisy 

I'm sick of this clique mentality. Rodhullandemu told me my proposed contribution to an article was worth """"fuck all"""". He also aggressively removed a legitimate talking point from the article's talk page as """"unsourced bollocks"""". My contribution which, apparently, was worth """"fuck all"""" and was """"piss poor"""" is currently featured in the article. It was cited (by me) and must have passed some scrutiny to remain in the article. Right?

Doubtless these inconvenient facts will do little to change your mind regarding my block. But at least show a little consistency with regards to personal attacks and use of profanities. The truth is, Rodhullandemu began all this anomosity between him and I and it all goes back to this. I'm sure this constitutes a personal attack, especially as I've since been vindicated regarding our feud (ie; I was 100% correct; he was not).

Groan. -) This is another one of those """"specialized usage vs general consistency"""" dilemmas that comes up so often. Is WP a general encyclopedia that includes philatelic material, or a union of general and specialized encyclopedias? Secondly, is it a worthwhile effort to fight for a special exception to WP's usual practices? I would say not, because industry usage seems like more of a longstanding convention rather than a key point of fact (I've never seen an """"official"""" explanation of the GB preference, for instance), and redirects work well enough to get people to our content (there should be category redirects irrespective of the name chosen).

"Notable alumni ==

This section badly needs cleaning up. I am happy so to do but I should like to seek support, here, first. A prerequisite is that attendance at the school should be reliably sourced - no source must mean no inclusion. The second prerequisite is notability. A page is not needed to demonstrate notability but it helps! Looking at the red-links some have no claims to notability and for some the claims can be simply tested. Take Mike Pointing for example. If he has played in a competitive match for Harlequins first team then he meets WP:Athlete. If he has just played for their academy then he doesn't. If Michael Latham is an influential film-maker why doesn't he have a page? My view is that if an editor thinks that an alumnus is notable and feels strongly that they should be included in this list then write a stub! It is always quicker to write a stub than have a long debate trying to establish their notability separately.

To deal with this situation efficiently I am proposing that red-linked or unsourced people should be moved here. This preserves the information that we have about them and they can then be moved back to the article as sources are found or notability is demonstrated. Views, please.   

I'm with you, TerriersFan. Move the redlinks here or give a diff to the deletion; they can be added back when the burden of proof is met.   

I too agree with your suggestion. Thanks for taking this on.

 Randroide Answers to """"Next Step"""" 

Guys, I do not see you taking steps to Wikipedia:Requests for mediation.

I can not do this job because I always connect from """"filtered"""" institutional net-access, and following those steps could result in new, undesired, controversial """"truncation"""" of words by the software. I do not want that happenning.

Could you please follow the instructions in the link I provided?. Thank you. 

 Randroide answers to New reference by Burgas00 

  At last we agree on something!...of course that the new section is a good idea: The false """"suicidal"""" terrorists from PRISA will also be included there. 

Come oooooon, boys, start writing that section. I do not want all the kudos for myself: The new proposed article is, by now, an effort made only by me. 

But remember: NPOV and sources, all the sources. Just like me citing """"El País"""" in the section about the doubts about the genuineness of the 13th bomb. Cheers  

 

Indeed, a good point. And all the remarks in COPE too. And the """"moral certitudes"""" of Mariano Rajoy published in El Mundo.

  I agree with you 100%, Larean.

  What Randroide omits to mention on the section about the 13th bomb is that he only added balancing references when I insisted that he do so, the original version he created was entirely POV, as is much of the rest of the proposed article. Also, all the sources that he added from El Pais are only available to subscribers - NPOV it is not. 

  You are right, Southofwatford, in your """"Randroide omits..."""" section.

If you have not subscription to """"El País"""", I am sorry but that´s your problem. My """"institutional"""" access also has some advantages, like paid access to """"El País"""" (and many, many other publications and books). That´s one of the reasons for my exclusive use of """"filtered"""" Internet accesss: It´s much easier for me to work here due to the easy availability of sources.

Do you see?. The truncation of words is offsett (I think) by better sources.

BTW, if you write under a """"Randroide answers"""" section you are:
Invading """"my"""" space. I do not mind, really. But you are doing it.
Risking new truncations on your messages. To avoid this, please write OUTSIDE """"Randroide answers"""" sections.

If you think that the proposed article is POV, work in it to make it NPOV. The article is not """"mine"""".

  I'll take the risk of you truncating the reply and put it here, it's very short. The issue is not whether I subscribe to El País, its whether the people who read an article in the English Wikipedia subscribe to it. All sources used should be accessible to all readers of the article, putting in a source that readers will not be able to see just so you can claim the article is NPOV is, to my mind, completely unreasonable.

  

All sources used should be accessible to all readers of the article

Very funny, Southofwatford. 

I am going to follow this joke of yours.

Please propose also the deletion of all books as sources, because, did you know?, there is always someone without this or that book.
Delete all references to TV or radio stations, because that user in Brazil has no TV and no radio at home.
Delete all the references in spanish, because, did you know?, there are users who know no spanish.

It´s a pleasure to read this kind of funny jokes, really. I had a good laugh.

User:Southofwatford  How strange that you should find it so funny, after all most of the sources we are providing should enable users to find out more information about what is being sourced, so to deliberately choose sources that require those users to pay to see the information is not funny, it's simply bizarre. Equally, in the English Wikipedia I would argue that choosing a Spanish or other foreign language source when an equally valid source exists in English does not make sense, except perhaps to those who are too busy laughing - your cynicism is evident in your response.

These are the attrocities that America demonizes, and most familar to Americans, but added to the list are less known attrocities:  Japan's attrocities in China, Frances attrocities in Algeria, the first genocide of Armenians against Turkey, Colonial attrocities, etc.  All of these attrocities have something in common: their are always """"little Eichmann's"""" like yourself, who deny and downplay these attrocities.  As long as their are people like yourself, their will always be genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.  I have no respect for you and your ilk.  None.

DEFEAT totalitarian Islamofascism

Our commander in chief liberated Iraq and Afganistan. But there's much left to TAKE OUT and LIBERATE. These are the regimes that we need to effect a regime change sooner or later:

Most urgent:

Iran,
Syria,
Communist China,
North Korea,
Saudi Arabia,
Cuba,
Liberia,
Laos,
Lebanon,
Vietnam,
Libya,
Zimbabwe,
Burma,
Malaysia,
Belarus,
Venezuela,
Moldova (elected an actual Communist Party member)
Palestinian Authority

Less urgent, but necessary one day:

Brazil (I laid out a case for regime change in Brazil on another user's page. If you're interested, I can direct you to that page.),
Ecuador (elected a Communist),
Argentina (elected a Communist sympathizer),
Algeria,
Morocco,
Tunisia,
Egypt,
Pakistan (the military dictator they have is ok to keep a lid on the Islamists, but he'll fall one day so we might as well occupy them),
Qatar (Al Jazeria is based there spewing its anti-American propaganda),
Tunisia,
and every other country that is not a democracy or is a democracy that elects anti-democratic leftists like Hugo Chavez

Countries we should destabilize, but not necessarily prusue regime change through military means:

France,
Germany,
Belgium,
Canada,
Mexico,
South Africa,
Turkey,
Russia,
Sweden,

Dispute over Human Rights Watch citation

This edit is the latest in a minor fracas over this cite, which fracas began here when Wehwalt removed the cite from the lede, describing HRW as a """"pressure group."""" Actually, in this controversial topic, probably the majority of sources could be described as """"pressure groups,"""" but that doesn't make them reliable when properly cited. I restored the cite in a less prominent position here, at which point Wehwalt added a rebuttal sentence, with edit summary """"added explanation of why the IDF knocked down these structures, consolidated into the Background section."""" I found this problematic, because the article doesn't actually say what Wehwalt added; it says that the group analyzed the claims by the IDF, and found them to be largely bogus. So, to leave Wehwalt's edit in place creates a false impression of what the HRW reports. I modified the section according, which edit was then reverted by Wehwalt. I'm going to leave it alone for a day or so to give Wehwalt the opportunity to clean it up. Incidentally, in Wehwalt's latest edit summary, he says that """"This is the article on Corrie, not on home demolitions. We are to give the reader a modicum of info on this, not draw conclusions."""" First of all, it seems to me that Corrie is only notable because of home demolitions. Secondly, giving the reader """"a modicum of info"""" would be best served by an accurate summary of the HRW cite, whereas altering it for POV reasons would be an example of """"drawing conclusions.""""

 Paul Heinegg 

""""According to the Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, a 1950 dissertation by Edward Price, a cultural geographer, documented that Melungeons were families descended from free people of color and mixed-race unions in colonial Virginia.[3] Beginning in 1995, the researcher Paul Heinegg has published extensive documentation of his research into numerous families of free people of color in the Upper South, beginning with those listed in the censuses of 1790-1810 in Virginia and North Carolina, whose descendants migrated into Kentucky and Tennessee. He found that most could be traced to free mixed-race families formed of descendants of unions between white women and African men in colonial Virginia.[4] They migrated along with European American neighbors to frontier areas, where they found less restrictive racial conditions. In some cases, he found that descendants consistently """"married white"""", and had children of increasingly European-American or white appearance. Heinegg has frequently updated his book and online version of data.""""

Nothing in this mentions Melungeons The sources does not mention Melungeons either so this should be removed. We should only use stuff in a article about melungeons which is directly about Melungeons.  

The person who added this attempted to use """"free person of color"""" to mean african american when the law stated Free Person of color was not just african american, it was a catch all term. 

""""This Court among other things instructs the jury as follows. Persons that are known and recognized by the Constitution and laws of Tennessee, as free persons of color are those who by the act of 1794 section 32 are taken and deemed to be capable in law to be certified in any case what is in, except against each other or in the language of the statute """" all Negroes, Indians, Mulattoes, and all persons of mixed blood descended from Negro or Indian ancestors to the third generation inclusive though one ancestor of each generation may have been a white person, white bond or free"""".

I am a 36 year old proud former US Marine who served my country and I resent being called a """"Terrorist Supporter"""". I have never given money to the IRA, I am Irish Catholic and I support Sinn Fein, but not the IRA.

The IRA is much more like the Iraqi Kurds, Northern Alliance, Jewish Irgun, French Resistence, and American Revolutionaries. I am also not a UDA/UVF terrorist apologist as Jdorney seems to be.

I also resent being banned just because some wanna-be administrator is upset that my article contains more accuracies then his does. I have re-edited my article and placed all the proper Sources, page numbers, and Quotes. I have also added to the """"Sources"""" index. I have never ment to purposely delete anyones work, if I did so it was by accident and I apologize.

I certainly don't mind other people adding to the article, but I don't think that my edits should be deleted, just because they don't """"fit"""" with the bias of some editor's and administrators.

 Nothing personal 

Greetings Elitra, I just wanted to let you know my comments are nothing personal towards you or the other WMF folks but the release of VE with so many problems is premature and folks have a valid point that proper notification wasn't given. Please don't take the following as a negative reflection but I wanted to clarify a couple things. People are frustrated because now, as in the past, it seems as thought the WMF doesn't listen to what us editors are saying. Yes you have evidence that you tried to notify users but the way the notifications were done and the places they were located gives the impression that the folks building these changes don't understand the community or how it works. You are also worknig hard to fix the problems but then releae the app to all logged in users knowing there are a lot of problems, many of which are severe. Then you act as though your surprised and hurt that we are annoyed. We know you are working on the problems, but so are we and we want to feel as though our voices are heard too. When the Visual Editor talk pages aren't filled with long lists of complaints and bugs, then we can talk about a widescale release. But there's no need to rush it out yet. Anyway, I just wanted to clarify that the problems aren't with you, they are with the WMF organizations's ongoing policy of doing whatever they feel like regardless of what us dumb editors think. Happy editing. PS, sorry they mixed us up.  

 Your user page 

Hi Elitre, when we designed the  template, we intended to make it easy for staff to use it and edit it, so added parameters that would make it easy to update the relevant sections. I noticed that you'd substituted the template on your user page instead of transcluding it and presumed this was not intentional, so I've gone ahead and boldly switched it to the template, making a few general fixes. This should allow you to also edit your user page through the Visual Editor. Please feel free to undo my changes if you intended to substitute the template! -) helpfulone 

 Random act of kindness 

 Hello Elitre (WMF), Eduemoni has given you a shining smiling star! You see, these things promote WikiLove and hopefully this has made your day better. Spread the  whether it be someone you have had disagreements with in the past or someone putting up with some stick at this time. Enjoy! ↑talk↓

Speedy deletion of Adam thometz
 A tag has been placed on Adam thometz requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia.

Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

What were you ranting about?

Are you talking to me, or the 300+ people who've downloaded this refutation of you and your uncivil friends?: http://www.mininova.org/tor/1264745

And so that everyone can see part of it here:

JoshuaZ said:

""""Starfire, as I tried to explain to you Wikipedia cares about reliable sources and verifiability, not truth. Now, if you read that guideline, you may understand why in general AIG and many of the other sources you used are not reliable sources.""""

Hey JoshuaZ the liar, where does Wikipedia's policy say that AnswersInGensis.org is not a reliable source? Where JoshuaZ the vandal and liar? Show us. So you think saying, """"Now"""" is scientific evidence that you are a wise and intelligent teller of the truth or that you know what a reliable and verifiable source is?

JoshuaZ, where does Wikipedia's policy say that the Jacob Sheep Association = a reliable and verifiable source that Jacob Sheep are biologically primitive you hypocrite? Explain that hypocrite who personally attacked Starfire777 using lies.

Show your references JoshuaZ. Saying, """"Now"""" is not a reference that your accusations are true are they? Why can't you make sense Joshua?

Again, where did those verses prophecy anything? Do these look like prophecies JoshuaZ?:

Joshua also said:

""""In this case, they did have sources, so you have even less of an argument.""""

Wrong JoshuaZ. Simply citing sources as you yourself said does not make the source valid. It must be substantiated and verifiable. Why do you conveniently forget that you smug babbling hypocrite?

Your later comments don't merit much of a response, but I wThen he said:

""""ill simply note that accusing people of bigotry, bias, hypocrisy, irrationality and trolling makes my earlier comment about not using """"Darwinist"""" as a slur somewhat irrelevant;""""

Because you said so JoshuaZ, and whatever you said is true is true because you said so. So much for references eh? All you have to do is accuse and it makes you right, right hypocrite? See how you go round and round in circles using circular reasoning?

""""if your earlier comment toed the line, the one above crosses it.""""

Because you said so JoshuaZ, and whatever you say is true because you said so. Science!

""""I suggest you calm down""""

I suggest you not use sarcastic insults like that, ok hypocrite? You're implying that the Starfire777 is ill-tempered merely because he points out that you are hypocrite and uses logic to do so (as well as verifiable references on Answersingenesis.com which you lied about not being reliable and being against Wikipedia's rules to cite), ok liar?

I suggest you also not command a Christian to follow your moral standards over Christ's, over God's. He is a Christian don't ya know? Are you now God to tell him how to feel and think? I suggest you read this verse and take it to heart which millions of Christians know very well so that you learn how not to offend them again:

""""Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger, and give no opportunity to the devil."""" - Ephesians 4:26-27

Last time I checked JoshuaZ, neither your nor Wikipedia's rules superceded God's. 

""""and read the relevant Wikipedia policies and guidelines while you wait for your block to expire.""""

Oh the old """"you need to read it but I don't"""" and """"you sit and think while your grounded young man"""" insults. What an arrogant, childish hypocrite you are.

I suggest that you stop pretending that whatever you say is true merely because you said it, and again, learn what Starfire777 properly told you to learn.

I'll enhance the list for you:

Reference, evidence, truth, reality, lie, bigot, hypocrite, fallacy, circular reasoning, troll, stalking, harassment, insults, hatred, and love.

And Joshua also said:

""""This is in addition to issues of original research in regard to Biblical prophecies and other issues on the Charles Darwin page.""""

Wow you sure like to weasel-word: """"other issues""""? What are you references for this vague """"other issues"""" JoshuaZ the Policy Master of Wikpedia?

And Joshua, who said anything about prophecies? Where did Starfire777 say anothing about prophecies? No JoshuaZ the wannabe scholar, he said """"predicted"""" in the same way that science can be used to predict the outcome of an experiment. If your lazy-brained truth-careless self had been paying attention to what he said CARE FULL Y you might have noticed that the verses were using PAST TENSE JOSHUA, not FUTURE TENSE JOSHUA.

In the section Levellers#Origin_of_name there is the following text:
´´It first appeared in print in a book written by Charles I called 'His Majesties Most Gracious Declaration', first sold around 15 November 1647.´´
On the 11th of November 1647 the King Charles R send a message to the Speaker of the House of Lords in which he talks about the Levellers, this is a letter in which he states that he is forced to flee from Hampton Court. The King arrived on the Isle of Wight on the 14th and stays with the Governor Robert Hammond. And as the King was effectively being held a prisoner by Colonel HammondCharles_I_of_England#English_Civil_war long after the 16th. 
Which made me wonder who started selling the book, and whether the book was sold despite or because of the tumult. As this all occurs in between the First English Civil War, which ended May of 1646, and the Second English Civil War. Naturally at the time 'His Majesties Most Gracious Declaration' was published there was no foresight that predicted the Second English Civil War, but it might be considered slightly inflammatory. And although I don't doubt the book is genuine, it is plain that Charles I had little to do with the sale as he was on the Isle of Wight.

No point in concealing the fact that oil and gas exports and petroleum price play important role in the Russian economy. However there is no point in highlighting this fact too much since it borders with spreading the myth that Russian economy is only oil and gas and nothing or almost nothing else.
Few facts:
Significant growth of oil prices started only in 2004-2005, but the Russian economy started growth (and rather large growth) well in 1999-2000. 
Russian economy is not only export. The recovery of oil and gas and other minerals was only 9% of GDP in 2011  and only 6.8% was oil and gas  (with figures not much larger in the previous years). The share of oil and gas in GDP gradually falls.
Unprocessed oil and gas takes only 45% of Russian exports. More of the rest are oil-based products and fuels, but this is considered manufacturing . So the phrase in one of the last edits about the """"oil and gas, which is the majority of Russian exports"""" is oversimplified, and certainly not correct if we speak about raw materials vs manufacturing.
Federal budget grew much faster in the last decade than oil prices . And it is not clear whether """"a five-fold increase in price of oil and gas"""" is correct description - it was four-fold increase in 2000-2011, but seven times increase in 1999-2011.
In 2008 only 23% of federal budget revenues came from exports oil and gas (customs tariffs), and 18% from taxes on petroleum and mining companies . However, when we speak about the consolidated budget (federal budget + regional budgets) the similar figures for oil and gas would be just 14% and 10% .
All this means the following:
The economic growth in the early 2000s was not very much dependent on oil and gas prices. So it is incorrect to ascribe early economic growth under Putin to petroleum prices.  
Overall, the dependence (whatever its scale) of the Russian economy on oil and gas is not Putin's invention, and the share of this sector in the Russian GDP actually is falling.
However, oil and gas money constituted a very large share of the federal (but not so consolidated) budget in the Putin era. This means that it is more correct to speak that it is not the Russian economy on the whole, but the federal budget which is dependent on oil and gas.
And a qualitative addition to the figures: Russia is a northern cold country and Russia is industrial country, which means that it needs lots of fuel for itself, but it is also a (very) resource-rich country, so no wonder that it produces much energy, have lots of facilities for that, and takes the opportunity to export abroad a lot (every country in similar conditions does that: the U.S. , Canada, Norway). This is not good or bad feature of the economy, just the fact.  Talk 
We need to revert your additions on oil and gas simply because they are not entirely correct factually, and because all the key information in more generalized and accurate form is already in the lead. But if you have proposals to make some important additions in accurate wording, let's discuss them.  Talk """,0.0

Firstly, the saharaouis are very few and their independence would clearly have been the result of european colonialism of the maghreb and algerian expansionism in the region. I understand how countries which have been subjected to the humiliation of colonialism feel, their borders being decided by foreign powers, and i believe that the polisario should take their people out of the horrendous conditions they live in in the camps of Tindouf and move back to their land.

The problem being, my friend, that you are not a specialist in that field, and have been posting for over a month in YBM's private forums, and are a very big fan and socket puppet of his.

Thanks. After the moderator bug happened a couple of days ago, one non-mod was able to modify the welcome page and have his changes realised within VP, and then there was some chat in IRC about how easy it would be to get by my """"security."""" The mod bug resulted from problems in reading the page history (I'll spare you the technical details), and if someone managed to move the page along with its history, it would be very simple for anyone to edit the resulting redirect to include their username and have his changes realized (as well as to disable the tool for everyone else, except for me of course =)).

Personally I'm not as it really seems like we're portraying Donohue's characterizations as valid. Give Donohue (which essentially is the Catholic League) credit as he is a seasoned p.r. and talk show veteran and seems to know what hot buttons to push and how. However if we are going to give him a platform I would feel better if we broke down the section into the major points with balancing statements so the readers can easily see the issues dissected and addressed. To me the section feels like a several-headed beast each adding a sentence onto the next with the net result of confusion. I suggest sections including one devoted to just the League's issues (if it's just them) so we don't infer because the League said X then Y happened. In my opinion Donohue speaks as if he's representing Catholics and is actually seen by many Catholics as an extremist (I'm not sure if right-wing is accurate) who's actually feeding anti-Catholicism by perpetuating stereotypes in pop culture arenas while ignoring concerns of mainstream Catholics. I may not be wording this in the best way but I think the gist is there. Benjiboi,0.0

 MY STATEMENT 

AND WHAT IS IT I DID EXACTLY TO BE BANNED?
WILL SOMEBODY PLEASE EXPLAIN?
You are obviously not aware of what is goinf ´g on I am ban for not contributing at all with the talk page!! what ? I am the one who asked for this mediation for more than 2 weeks ago and it was for something else than that and this snowskinner who was asked to bring the arbitration knows it perfectly. And i am the one working out ot bring the two best cosmolog in the world to look at those thesis, ans I am the one who did contributed the most in this affair together with Igor Bogdanov, at the refute of those falsifications of evidencies presented here by ybm and his acolytes.
I was ban because ybm had been ban and couldn't stand it.
But where he was ban 24 hours for insulting repaeatridly people and calling Igor Bogdanov a bastard 3 times and for having on several occassions oversteped the 3RR rule, I was ban 3 x 24 hours for having presented an article who was evaluated by Bidhonene who is a very endeared friend of YBM, for not being so usefull as she wish.
An article containing of course a serie of evidenscies who didn't have been shown before, and who constiture a major block against the conspiratorial arguments of ybm and his gang.
Just as she did it here on my talk page when she deleeted it all, and vnever reinserted it, a precious document proving the ´factual connection between YBM and this Voyer who infatuated this whole affair.
It was YBM who had invited his friend on my talkpage, until he realized that i had an arbitration going on that was about this.
Bishonen blocked me 20 minutes after her protegé had been blocked.
i dont see any of her interventions in this talk page concerning the insults of rjb and ybm, nor concerning their cynical and very empty and longs comments about my mediation on the talk page tonight.
You can read my articles yourself and see how hard I was fighting to make sure that the situation will not degenerate further, and to calm down the spirit.
She didn't make an intervention there to ask rjb and ybm to stop their acction and provocating attitudes, nor accused them for saying nothing nor removed their articles for not improving the talk page, nor contributing with anything on it.
She has already been told to don't interfeer anymore on this talk page because she is unable to differentiate between  her liking and her work as an admi.
She does not follow the rules and do a very destructiv work, using retaliation and arbitrarious judgement all the time, and always something who arranged ybm very much.
She even do revert for him and use her status to commit illegitimate stuff.
The arbitration should have been about this too.
They are using the fact that mediator Nicholas turnbull is out for a week to do their bad deeds.
And this snowsnippers know that what he does is out of hand, and that he should never have done it.
He even insulted Nicholas turnbull.
Easy when people aren't there to defend themselves.
Wiki english is a spot on the face of Wikipédia, admi are behaving like sabotors and vandaliser and encourage riot, and abuse of their knoledge and power to undermine actions made to refrein their wrong doing.

This has to stop.
I asked for a mediation and an arbitration comity for more than two weeks and Sowspinners actions are completely unlegitimate.
He has stollen MY mediation and MY arbitration request.
This don't go and has to be aborted.
I do not recognise the actual arbitration for being legitimate, and thereby ask all to boycot it.

None of the involved administrator can in anyway be part of the arbitration comity or of the arbitration.
It is a close debate and not an arena game.
THis arbitration was supposed to be hold secret, as snowspinner knows very well, and took some very unlucky initiatives from the very beginning.
He is an idiot to have done that, and has no sens of responsability, nor of maturity, and cannot be trusted.
He must be removed as well.
i dont accept what happened tonight. There was absolutly no reasons for me to be blocked and certainly not for 3 days.
If I say fuck! like ybm nothing happen, but if I bring precious evidencies, so I am ban and the evidencies confiscated and destroy yes, and detroyed as they have been alredy here several times.
This is the sign of a totalitarian system, and wiki english has became a totalitarian system, where the judged perform the judgement, and were all proofs are stollen and destroyed and were disturbing people are threaten for their meaning and impert to say more, and blocked away.

"I think that it is unlikely that good faith is as much of an issue for most of us as is being unconsciously blind to our own biases. It is clear that Rhwentworth is highly invested in NVC, and while he may have a business COI, I think it is more likely he would simply like to protect NVC from what he sees, given his expertise, as unfair criticism. Sunray is more curious. S/he has, in my opinion, been extremely defensive, tendentious and aggressive, having accused several of us of wikilawyering and harboring a hidden agenda against NVC, as well as claiming we had reached consensus when in fact the defenders (mostly me) had simply given up, having felt bulldozed. S/he has also consistently removed material from the criticisms section, because s/he incorrectly assessed the sources, could not find a convenient link to the source, or because the source was deemed inappropriate for criticismyet left the source in place for material elsewhere in the article. I have no idea why Sunray is so aggressive about critiques of NVC, but I doubt it is a COI or bad faith.

The strong objections to the critiques by a number of pro-NVC advocates, such as Sunray and Rhwentworth, essentially consist of the idea that there are no valid criticisms of NVC. In the previous arguments over these sources, the substance of the objection came down to either rejecting the source as unreliable (for criticism but not for promotion) or claiming that the source misunderstands NVC and thus is simply wrong. So at this point, the only critique of NVC we have noted in the article is that it lacks critique. Given the strong and diverse critiques of NVC that have been published, this is sad to me.

I pointed out that disparaging of the sources of criticism of NVC as being unreliable, minority, inaccurate etc. should also apply to the sources supporting NVC. On this talk page, I went through every reference in the article and showed that they were nearly all from promotional or minority literature. It is hard to find traditionally reliable (e.g. academic, peer-reviewed, mainstream, etc.) sources for any aspect of NVC. This has marginally improved.

I suggested previously that we have a responses section rather than a critique or criticisms section, which I hoped would allow some of the responses from non-academic or non-traditional sources to be aired in the article. We have been stuck arguing about the academic sources, however, so I am thinking that the less reliable sources would not be accepted. 

I believe that beyond the argument we are having about sources for explicit criticism of NVC, there are other big issues. The article was originally criticized by editors as sounding promotional, and we made some headway in fixing this. Lately, however, the article has again been rewritten, in my opinion, to promote NVC. This consists of burying information that might cast NVC in a less than glorious light and by making the article essentially a description of how the advocates of NVC see it as working, rather than putting it into a context for naive readers. For example, Sunray argued very strongly that NVC is not a conflict resolution technique, but is a trademark of an organization and therefore should not be criticized under the BLP policy. I then added the information that NVC is trademarked to the intro, but this was removed to the very end of the article. (Perhaps there should be an 'sm' next to each mention of NVC, since it is a trademarked item.) The one study of NVC efficacy described in detail in the article as research was published in a non-peer-reviewed newsletter. This information was removed to the reference section rather than staying in the article itself, where I put it. The fact that there is nearly no discussion, research or confirmation of NVC in the literature was removed from the introduction to become the sole critique of NVC, at the end of the article. And, as one of the sources on NVC notes, one critique of NVC is that it is based on beliefs rather than research. This is no longer mentioned in the article explicitly. 

As far as moving forward, I think the Gorsevski and the Flack sources are high quality and the reasons adduced for exclusion do not seem sufficient. I do not think we have to go into any detail on the contents of their critiques, but we should mention they exist and provide a citation. I also think that one major critique of NVC is that many organization have attempted to adopt it and found it problematic. This is the opinion of one of our high quality academic (and pro-NVC) sources. I think a sentence to this effect should be included, with the reference. I also think it would be legitimate to include here the opencouchsurfing.com and noesis.org mention, and Sarles self-published critique (which is discussed in the academic source). The pro-NVC academic sources are not afraid to address the critiques, so I am not sure why t",0.0

All of a sudden everyone is an expert on WP. 
In Gaza, even the Red Cross accepts that the intention is probably to use WP to create smoke rather than to deliberately injure; the Associated Press quotes the ICRC's Peter Herby as saying: """"It's not very unusual to use phosphorus to create smoke or illuminate a target. We have no evidence to suggest it's being used in any other way.""""
WP smoke rounds are not classed as an incendiary weapon either. This is because the 1980 Geneva Protocol on Incendiary Weapons specifically does not cover """"Munitions which may have incidental incendiary effects, such as illuminants, tracers, smoke or signaling systems.""""
… the case put forward by Human Rights Watch and others is not that WP is an incendiary, but that its use """"violates the requirement under international humanitarian law to take all feasible precautions to avoid civilian injury and loss of life."""" This looks like a reference to a different treaty, the 1949 Geneva Protocol, which has a section on """"General protection against effects of hostilities"""".

I did not say what you repeatedly say I said. You have several times now said I should be blocked for calling somebody a """"cunt"""". You have repeatedly made false accusations against me without a single time providing a diff. I am well aware of what I have written and where it was written. I have not called you or anybody else such a word anywhere on Wikipedia. The most outrageous thing in the diff in which you were blocked for was not your reference to """"cancer"""". It is your persistence in spreading false and malicious commentary about me. In that diff you say When Nableezy had the balls to say that he knew someone was a sockpuppet but that he was keeping his mouth shut because he likes him it showed that he was here for one reason and one reason only. Post a diff that backs that comment up. Just one, try to find one. Later on you say this time he called people cunts. Could you please provide a diff in which I call people (pl) cunts (pl) or even a person a cunt? Of course you cant, but that doesnt stop you. I dont even care if you are blocked or not, I wanted an admin to make you stop making these outrageous accusations without providing any evidence. Earlier you made several allusions to various people who think I was socking. You back out of it by saying """"Im not the one accusing you, just other unnamed people do"""", as if that allows you to drop such an accusation with out one bit of evidence.The other problems with your comment aside, the accusation that you made that I """"breed cancer"""", that cancer being sockpuppetry, shows only how obsessed you are with directing fault to me. You think I am the reason NoCal or Dajudem socks? Really? I, hoping that I am right, will assume you say this because you are just unaware of the actual history, as opposed to purposely ignoring or distorting it. Much of this happened before my time here, but before I got involved in editing here I read a quite a bit of the history, through article and user talk pages and archives, AfDs, ANI, AE, AN3, ..., and the arbitration cases. So I have a certain familiarity with the actors of this play and know the story fairly well. Once upon a time, there was a user named Isarig. This user has had their account """"vanished"""" to . Some things I dont know, as the user's talk page is deleted, and others dont need to be discussed, but this user vanished at the start of the ARBPIA case. The user already had a history of socking, how much is one of the things I dont know. This happened late 2007/early 2008, with his last edit talking place on Dec 24 2007. NoCal100 was created Jan 3 2008. Canadian Monkey Dec 30 2007. Mr Hicks The III is an older sock, from Sep 2007. There were a few others created back then. All this before this monstrous creature you refer to as Nableezy arrived and caused this man to start socking.Now, as for your BFF (Stellarkid). The account Dajudem was given a topic ban after the CAMERA lobbying issue came to light in April 2008. One month later the Tundrabuggy account was created. One of the first things this account did was to go after, in a purely vindictive manner, one of the admins who had dealt with that issue. She, dishonestly posing as a new editor confused by the rules, was able to game the system into producing several blocks or bans against that admin. She followed him from article to article, going away from the A/I area into random areas such as Persian history. She was able to hide the fact that she was doing this for some time, until she was discovered as Dajudem's sock and blocked. One month later, a new account, Stellarkid, is created. Posing as a new account confused by the rules, this new sock proceeds to do the same thing she did with that earlier admin with a new target (guess who?). She is able to successfully get a ban placed against her target. When this account is discovered to be a sock, a new account (in fact several) was created. Three separate accounts were blocked last time around, including one with no edits just waiting to be put in to use. So Dajudem began socking prior to ever seeing me, yet I am responsible for her continued socking? And NoCal? I am responsible for dozen or so different accounts that I know that he has, and that isnt counting the ones from Isarig? How can you possibly blame me for the fact that a number of die hard members of the Defenders of the Glorious Cause have repeatedly socked?But back to the point, dont make accusations that you cant provide evidence for. Either provide a diff of me calling somebody a """"cunt"""" or retract the charge. Same for the accusation that I knowingly overlooked sockpuppetry because I liked a user. nableezy - """,0.2857142857142857

Okay. I guess half the problemn is that you clearly haven't a strong grasp on the English grammar, and therefore do not understand often what people are writing.
'experts on the period who only use, like myself, RS' means I exclude myself from being 'a highly informed expert on al-Husseini' (unlike say Pluto and Zero, or even Greyshark). Since this is obviously the sense, and you fail to see it, it's probable that language difficulties account for your repeated apparent refusal to see the point.

Perhaps that is why you have for the third time, failed to respond to both what Zero and I have asked, and simply repeated your position. It's no fault if you cannot understand what is asked of you in a foreign language. It is a fault if you persist in reciting a set piece about what you think in the face of repeated requests for policy-based arguments. It's called WP:IDIDNTHEARTHAT

"""== Re: Telstra Article ==

Hello. I am new to Wiki but thought I had read the T&Cs; fairly well. I am surprised at the number of citations you are demanding for my edit to the Telstra mobile page. Many of the facts you are seeing citations for are indesputible engineering realities and hence you wont find a seperate statement from someone claiming same (although you may find news paper articles backing some of the claims). The points made about 850 having superior coverage to 2100 cant be disputed and I would ask since that being the case, what sort of citation should I be looking for to back up the statement?

I accept referencing Whirlpool for carrier customer numbers is a bit slack. The only reason I did that was that in that discussion thread was a neatly pulled together list of each carriers end of year reports showing their customer base - which highlighted the point that Telstra is the largest carrier by subscriber base at this time. Considering that it is not appropriate to reference a forum thread, how can I best reference this to Wikipedia's satisfaction?

I also note that you removed the citations that pointed back to Telstra.com. The third party aspect of your requirement there is almost not appropriate when you are refering to direct history or a Telstra product reference on the topic. Specifically, the references to Telstra having the first automated mobile network are hard to find anywhere else but on Telstra's media pages - because quite frankly no other operator is going to want to talk about it, and no other Australian source of any repute exists on the internet that would be bothered backing up such claims that I have been able to find (again I dont like quoting news papers because there is no traceability as to the reliability of their sources in the first place - an encyclopedia based on newspapers is a sure way to enshrine into history some editors' warped viewpoint which may or may not be right, but someone reading something and seeing a reference pointing at a news paper may not recognise as simply being another editors point of view.

Please, can you outline how I can more effectively cite elements of my contribution and to an extent justify your requirements for citations where I have not yet been able to find any suitable meaningful references?
   

Hi. I'm not sure if you have checked out Wikipedia:Reliable sources which also links to many other wiki policies. If there is a few lines in the article which is in a source you can cite it more then once using [cite information here] once then adding  on the other sentences with in the article. 

Whirlpool isn't a reliable source but other if it links to a source you could use that source instead but as long as it's reliable source and a third party source.  

Websites Telstra and any company it owns isn't a third party source which can be seen a bias and can be seen as a point of view which it way we use third party sources (See Self-published sources).

Newspapers can be used whether or not it's a website or you can just reference the title of the article, name of the paper, page, date it was printed and who the story was written by, As you can trace Newspapers who's stories may not be online or the story was before the internet was around. I hope this helps.

Barrett's list is published information.  Counting the number of organizations on the list does not represent original research.  It is simply a way of summarizing the context in which Barrett's criticism occurred.  It is information that is directly and explicitly supported by the source.  It is a routine calculation that most people over the age of six could perform for themselves.

As the article stands now, it is misleading and unbalanced.  A casual reader gets the impression that Barrett targeted the IONS out for special and specific criticism, when in fact his criticism was spread over hundreds of organizations.

"Absolute Proof that 0.999... IS NOT EQUAL TO 1 
A math-wiki:

You are wrong about infinite representation. The ancient Greeks *never* represented 1/3 as 0.333... 

Now let me refute your argument regarding the transitive property:

A)    1=3(1/3)
B)    3(1/3) = 3(0.333...)
C)    3(0.333...) =0.999... 

The problem here occurs in B) where you assume that 3 * 0.333... = 3 * 1/3. You have 'not proved' anything. On the contrary, you have only proved that you are assuming 1/3 = 0.333... which it is obviously 'not equal'. 0.333... is an 'indeterminate' number because it cannot be represented finitely in base 10. 
0.333... is not equal to 1/3 so you cannot say that 1/3 is a finite representation. An indeterminate number is a number that is repeating in any
radix system.

You mention the division algorithm but do you know what it says? The division algorithm has 'nothing' to do with radix systems. Let me state it for you - If a and b are two given integers, there are unique integers q and r
such that a=bq + r and  0<= r < b. Now I will use the division algorithm to prove that you are WRONG once and for all. Suppose a = 1 and b = 0.999..., then 
what are the integers q and r such that the above is true?

Suppose that q = 0 and r = 1. Then the division algorithm fails because it makes a false statement i.e. q and r can both be 0 and 1 respectively.
For example: 1 = (0.999...)(1)+0 and 1 = (0.999...)(0)+1. So by default, the
division algorithm is proved false if 0.999... is equal to 1. And you can say a lot of things about the Greeks, but they would not make a stupid mistake like this. They were the smartest race in ancient times.

Now suppose that you try to tell me that either form is acceptable in the case of 0 and 1, you will still end up with a terrible contradiction:

1=(0.999...)(0)+1. The second form in this case implies that 1 < 0.999... since r < b. But how can 1 be less than 0.999... ??!!

"""
Enric, you present an impoverished idea of what Wikipedia editors can and should do. We do not report demonstrably false information as fact just because a reliable source says it, unless we balance it. We can and should balance secondary source error with primary source fact. The requirement is that the primary source facts reported should be directly verifiable without synthesis, by any ordinary person with ordinary skill applying reasonable effort. First of all, it's worth reading WP:OR over carefully. Then look at the essay linked from the WP:OR page, WP:NOTOR. See, specifically, this example:
A book, short story, film, or other work of fiction is a primary source for any article or topic regarding that work. Anything that can be observed by a reasonable person simply by reading the work itself, without interpretation, is not original research, but is reliance upon a primary source. This would include direct quotes or non interpretative summaries, publication dates, and any other patent information that can be observed from the work. For example, if there are multiple versions of a particular story, and one version does not have a particular character, or has extra characters, that is clear simply by reading or watching the work. The fact that one would have to read or watch the whole thing does not make the matter original research. The work is verifiable, even if it takes more time than flipping to a single page.
Notice that the example is quite on point here: After reporting what the DoE report says is claimed in the review document about the sixteen samples, 'blah blah.' we could say, """"The Hagelstein paper, which was the review document, does not contain a report of 'blah blah.' However, it does contain 'bleep bleep.'"""" And there is probably more than we can say; there is some criticism of the 2004 report in reliable source, if I'm correct. This tidbit, however, requires no source other than the 2004 DoE material.
Notice also that we probably cannot report, for example, that """"The 2004 DoE report contradicted itself,"""" unless we have secondary source on that. What we properly do is to present the elements of the (alleged) contradiction, without claiming contradiction, reliably sourced, and let the reader form his or her own conclusion. The elements are directly verifiable. The conclusion isn't.   """,0.0

 Terms I tagged """"dubious"""" may be deleted, as far as I am concerned. But do pay attention to the information I've added here and there in remark tags.
 Terms I tagged """"citation needed"""" I hope other editors will be able to find a source for. I ask other editors to refrain from deleting them for at least a month, and preferably actively help out in finding sources.   

Would you say  http://www.britishbirdlovers.co.uk/articles/collective-nouns-for-birds.html is a reliable source? I doubt it.

The terms sourced from The Free Dictionary are from the Book of St. Albans (attributed to Dame Juliana Barnes, 1486).

"Expansion of Design Groups 
Just a thought. The Role of Design Groups was very much affected by the rise of the internet and the integration of information technologies. This caused new skills such as ethnography, cognitive science, information architecture, etc. to be integrated into more traditional design skill sets. I would say that Clement Mok was an instrumental bridge between traditional design consultancies and the new interdisciplinary consultancies. I would also state that Ideo was very much driven from engineering as David Kelly's background is in engineering. It seems as if industrial designers and engineers invigorated designers and design methods. These are a few thoughts to chomp on . . . .( )",0.0

Please actually read what I'm saying. You are suffering from the same problem as Tao. You are not actually reading what I am saying. I plan to constructively contribute to the page. My sockpuppet was not meant to evade a ban. I was very honest that it was a sock puppet. There is no dishonesty there. Please read very carefully what I said as a sock puppet. I am not wasting your time because there is a basic, intrinsic problem with Wikipedia as represented by this process: people do not read, people do not listen, people do not consider actual intention. I have only positive intentions for the Beat Generation page. Tao has negative intentions for the Beat Generation page. Therefore, i have negative intetions for Tao. I promise from here on out that I will be kind and gentle and what have you, mostly because I simply did it for fun and it is no longer fun. Tao, being as lazy as he is, is a very uninteresting person to argue with. But my ultimate intention is to positively contribute to the page. Please look at my record. Please look at what I have contributed to Wikipedia in the past. Look at the Theatre of the Absurd page. I essentially wrote the whole page. Look at the Howl page. I wrote most of that page as well. Look at the Beat Generation page. I wrote very large portions of that page. The indefinite block should be very short because my intentions are very positive. Please read the first part of the post I did in which I very honestly identified myself as a sock puppet. I begged  and I would have been on my knees, if that was possible  for Tao to actually do the work necessary to positively change the page. And what did he do? He blocked me further. Why? What does that contribute positively? It's just a power game. That is the cancer of wikipedia. And as you have demonstrated from your comments, you are functioning only to continue that cancerous effect.  Please, please actually read what I'm actually saying. Why is nobody actually reading what I'm actually saying? Add up all the things I said on that talk page. My swear-filled rant was short. My genuine attempt to engage Tao in a positively focused debate was much, much, much longer. Please just, one of you for once in your life actually read.  Look at the post entitled """"Cite Off: Formal Argument edition."""" I say nothing in there insulting. That represents my true intention. I want to say this again because I'm afraid none of you are actually reading what I'm actually saying: Please, actually read what I'm actually saying. I don't know how much plainer I can make it. Please do not be lazy with the sort of laziness that destroys Wikipedia as a source. Read the section with """"formal argument edition"""" on it and tell me if that in any way represents a """"diatribe"""" as Tao claims. Then look at the way Tao says he's not going to read it because he assumes it's a """"diatribe"""". That section represents my genuine inention for the page, as does the """"let's get down to business"""" section. Ban me based on my rant, sure, but you can not seriously think that I'm the sort of poster it would be worthwhile to ban. I'm willing to follow your rules and to be cordial for the sake of the page. I am contrite to the degree that I recognized I broke rules and promise I will abide by the rules from here on forward, but I seriously want to urge you on a larger level to recognize the faulty bizarro world catch-22 of this system, where someone with only good intentions for the content of the page stands up for himself and for what is right and he's the one who gets punished, yet someone who undermines the value of Wikipedia as whole with laziness and stupidity is rewarded.

Speedy deletion of Sandycove waterpolo club
 A tag has been placed on Sandycove waterpolo club requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A1 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because it is a very short article providing little or no context to the reader. Please see Wikipedia:Stub for our minimum information standards for short articles. Also please note that articles must be on notable subjects and should provide references to reliable sources that verify their content. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

List of micronations is intended to be a list of notable micronations.  You can read about the general concept of notability at WP:NOTABILITY.  The problem is that a lot of people """"invent"""" a micronation with two friends one night, and then try to put it on Wikipedia.  Generally, notability requires that """"has received significant coverage in reliable sources that are independent of the subject.""""  That could be articles in newspapers or magazine, TV coverage, mentions in academic books, that sort of thing.  There are other ways to become encyclopedically notable, but that's the main one.  (We especially don't want things that clearly just fall under WP:MADEUP.)

As to how to physically type in a reference, the easiest thing to do would be to discuss the reliable sources on the article's discussion page first to get feedback from other people.  Frankly, ever since that book about micronations came out, we've been deleting about three non-notable contributions a week because everybody's eager to make up a micronation and get in on Wikipedia.  The new ones that have been added generally haven't made it without some discussion first, so that's the place to start.  Once we get past that point, we can worry about how to format the citation for the article.

Now, I'm not going to debate it (because I agree), but I do think this kind of statement needs proof from a reliable source.

- 

I've said it below earlier that he wasn't considered very famous in many parts in the world. So a citation is needed for the rock history thing. Because it's vague when you say just rock history, it would be fitting for Yoshiki to be the an influential drummer (maybe most, but that might need a citation as well) in rock history in Asia.  

So, when we say that Bonham is one of the most influentials drummers in the rock history, we have to say that his one of the most influentials drummers in UK and not in the rock history? =/, yeah, Yoshiki is the mots influential drummer of Asia, but Asia is also inside the rock history don't forget this ;)

 Only Japan? 

Somebody has just put that Yoshiki is one of the most influential drummers in Japan rock history, eehm, everybody knows that Yoshiki is THE drummer of Japan, and because of that is one of the most influentials in all rock history, not only in the rock history of Japan, if you see bands in China, Korea, et.c you'll see that their drummers are fans of Yoshiki.

Well, I guess not just Japan but in Asia. The reason to why I put that is because while Yoshiki is well-known in parts of Asia, he wasn't as influential in many countries like the Americas, Africa, and Europe. Sure, there are people in those continents that like him (and X-Japan as a whole), but it's not enough compared to the majority who hasn't heard of him or X.

 Rewrite 

The article has been rewritten to conform better with WP:V and to fix some of the damage done by this recent edit. I use the word """"damage"""" because the editor in question is a regular contributor to X Japan and was, at the time of the edit undoubtedly aware of the numerous references already available for that article. Why the editor failed to introduce them here, in order to preserve at least some of the information is quite puzzling. -  """,0.0

Hello, although this is technically an unblock appeal, it is really only a reason to explain.... you won't be in a mood to unblock me when I'm finished talking... )
First of all I want to apologise, I should have thought before putting the giant swastika on my page. This is the reason for that... I have a few Jewish friends, and normally we sometimes make jokes about jews and christians and things like that. I never really make jokes about the holocaust, because that never go over well with them and it is not nice... well, apparently, a joke about jews being lawyers set one of my closest friends off who is not really a jew, but claims he is.... now he thinks I am a facist, nazi, and I hate jews.... i gotreally frustrated and annoyed and so I came home and started messing around on my userpage... Second of all, i would like to ask why it is not permissable to """"self identify as a nazi""""? There are several userboxes dealing with this subject. There is even a userbox that states, """"This user identifies as a Hitlerist! WHAT THE HELL?!?!?! You will let people say they support Hitler, but you won't let them say they are nazis?!? Being a nazi does not mean that you condone Hitler or his actions, it simple means that you support the theory of the politics behind Nazism.... you can be a nazi and not support the horrible eugenics policy. But if you are hitlerist, that obviously says you support all that... your arguement would of course be that it is offensive to jews.... well if you are taking that into account, then you should also ban anyone that says they identify as a communist. That can be extremely offensive to christians... if you want me to, I can talk about all the horrible things they did to christians in communist russia (with reference of a nice book). I think I will... one of the things they did was putting shackles on the ankles and wrists of christians with spikes of the inside that cut into your skin if you moved at all... and then they put starved rats into your cell that tried to eat you alive so you had to fight them off while your wrists and ankles are killing you. They also tied you to a cross and hung you upside down over a huge pile of other prisoners crammed into a small room. You were then forced to excrete over everyone. You were also stood upright in a box while they drove long nails into it. It was alright if you stood perfectly still, but you would have to stand there for hours and then your body would sway and poke into the nails. They also stood you naked in a freezer with a doctor nearby that signalled when you were freezing to death and then they would take you out and warm you up. They would do that for hours on end. Then they would beat you over and over again asking you to renounce Christ... the holocaust was horrible, but I would rather be gassed or hung by a nazi than endure those tortures for 18 years like one man who wrote a book about his experiences... so could you ban all communists please? 
My last comment is in response to Chzz's question about me making the 'gay comment' statement. Nowadays the word gay is used for two meanings... one is homosexuality and the other is wierd, stupid, dumb... i was using the second connotation.... maybe if you people didn't spend so much time on this gay... sorry... stupid online encyclopedia you would realize how the real world uses words...
Even if you unblock me (which you won't... )...) I will take a wikibreak... i don't want to become addicted to point of ruining my social life...... i have already recieved a punishment, never becoming an admin (the whole gay... sorry... dumb trust thing)... just know this... i would have enventually removed the swastika after I cooled down and because of your gay... sorry... dumb policy you have lost a serious editor... this whole thing has really annoyed me...

"Final word on this 

Yes, I thank you for your time in the matter and I know you were trying to help. I can see that what I was doing was violating WP:POINT. 

Originally the argument was because of the table width which I knew from the beginning was a dumb thing to fight over, but I was only thinking of aesthetics. She trounced me for it saying that I don't know what I'm doing, that she was enforcing MoS standards and it was a known problem because the page didn't show up correctly on certain monitor sizes. All I wanted was for her to show me where these standards are written, and if not that, where this issue was being discussed if it's such a big problem. Of course she couldn't. Why? Because they don't exist. I called her bluff, she knew it, and then she acted all innocent like I came out of no where to bully her. I got aggressive only after her rude, holier-than-thou tirade started.

I've had to play this stupid game before with other idiots around here, usually they just go away, but she wanted to continue talking shit. She's just one of those crybabies who think they own the damn place and that kind of attitude pisses me off to no end. Sorry, but that's just me. I see bullshit everyday on here and I ignore 99% of it. She just happened to rub me the wrong way.

 criticism of jesus/plucking eyeballs out/slavery 

Jesus has been criticized as vindictive, intolerant, prudish, and unkind. Several scholars have noted that he appears to condone slavery.
 
−TABTAB 
−TAB
The cardinal Avery Robert Dulles stated that Jesus “said not a word against slavery as a social institution"""", and believes that the writers of the New Testament did not oppose slavery either.  In his paper published in Evangelical Quarterly, Kevin Giles notes that Jesus often encountered slavery, """"but not one word of criticism did the Lord utter against slavery,” and argues that Jesus must have then condoned it.  
 
−TABTAB 

How come the Catholic removed this section in his words """"because it didn't appear to be criticism"""" is this a joke?  
−TAB
Friedrich Nietsche argued that “a war was declared on passion” in the Sermon on the Mount, in which Jesus says of sexual temptation: """"If thy eye offend thee, pluck it out."""" According to Nietsche, “Destroying the passions and cravings, merely as a preventive measure against their stupidity and the unpleasant consequences of this stupidity, today this itself strikes us as merely another acute form of stupidity. We no longer admire dentists who """"pluck out"""" teeth so that they will not hurt any more…. the Christian who follows that advice and believes he has killed his sensuality is deceiving himself: it lives on in an uncanny vampire form and torments in repulsive disguises.”[Friedrich Nietzsche, 1878, Human all too Human: A Book for Free Spirits, The Wanderer and His Shado, aphorism 83] """,0.14285714285714285

 My Two Cents 

 Political correctness will be the end of our world as we know it. This is sad that political correctness has come to this level. It is causing our society to reward failure and condone criminal behavior. This is sad. We might as well change the constitution and exclude freedom of speech. This is next. Truly sad. Truly sad, indeed. 

 Also, regardless what you want to refer to the chinese as, china is the reason why the US's economy is in the crapper, and why our unemployment rate is higher than it has been since the early 1980's. We have made """"those people"""" rich while our economic infrastructure is crumbling. Open your eyes!

And for those reasons, I despise China as well as the politically correct.

 Niggardly 
It is apparent by reading wiki's page on the """"controversial"""" word """"niggardly"""", that stupid people and words do not mix. It has been said that most people never pick up a book after leaving high school. Proof of this exists in the fact that this word can be taken so blatantly out of definition, that persons are asking that it be banned from the English language. As I said, idiots and words can be a dangerous combination.

What is even sadder is that I expressed this comment on wiki's niggardly page, and was accused of vandalism, yet others posted similar comments.

 Comments on Talk:Ashurism 

Hi Elias.

They are definitely NOT emo. Come on. Emo music reflects death and the band wear makeup and cut themselves. I can't believe so many otherwise good wikipedia editors believe that all pop punk and alt rock bands are emo. This is completely false and too many people think it is true. Just listen to the band's newer music. It sounds completely different from emo and even from what most people think of emo as today. Calling this band emo is insulting them to the highest degree.

Speedy deletion of Tahsis claus
 A tag has been placed on Tahsis claus requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

""""I don't understand why you think the definition belongs only with momentum/time.""""  the reason is pedagogical within the physics discipline.  it would be a tautology to define the Joule as the amount of energy required to move a body against a force of 1 Newton the distance of 1 meter, then at the same time, define the Newton as 1 Joule per meter.  it's true but it says nothing about the quantities of the Joule or of the Newton (nor anything about their dimesion).  it is not like the chicken and egg, we know which one comes first (meter, kg, second come first, then the Newton before the Joule). the Planck force is a derived unit and will have to be the Planck unit of momentum divided by the Planck unit of time.  the fact that it comes out to be the basic tension in string theory or in, general relativity, the force that is the conversion factor between spacetime curvature and the energy density giving rise to it or, if multiplied by the fourth power of the (dimensionless) circular orbit speed some distance from a central body that it tells what the body would weigh at that distance, all these are fine and good, but they are the result of working out hypothesized physics problems, they are not the definition.  what if you worked out some other basic physics problem (say the basic tension of a string) and it came out to be 2 FP? or 4 π FP?  would you say that the force solutions to such are the definition of the Planck force?  it doesn't matter what the system of units are, once you have those 5 base units defined, there is no freedom left to define the others.  their definitions are purely consequential.
 i think you need to word things according to the most common terminology.  i fixed it a little more.  i inserted edit notes (invisible) that ask what does it mean to """"distribute energy over a gravitational radius""""? and what does it mean to """"distribute energy over the Compton wavelength""""?  unless you expect your encylopediac readers to know, even vaguely, when or where or how or why such distribution of energy is being done (thus defining the rate of such distribution), why say these words?  also, there still is no citation other than Schwartzchild radius, which i did.  so a reader does not think that this was all just made up, you might want to include references to other stuff.
 i fixed the convention errors and format errors (some just now).  do a diff comparison to see what i did.  """,0.0

 Semi-vegetarianism section 

I like Flyer22's intention in that one's recent edits, though I find the particulars a little unclear. Here is my proposal for the section (  ):
===Semi-vegetarian diets===
Semi-vegetarian diets primarily consist of vegetarian foods, though occasional exceptions are made for some non-vegetarian foods, including fish, poultry and even red meat. These diets may be followed by those who choose to reduce the amount of animal flesh consumed as a way of transitioning to a vegetarian diet, or for health, environmental, or other reasons. The term """"semi-vegetarian"""" is contested by most vegetarian groups, who believe that vegetarianism must exclude all animal flesh. Many individuals describe themselves as """"vegetarian"""" while practicing a semi-vegetarian diet. Semi-vegetarian diets include: 
 Flexitarianism: A diet that consists primarily of vegetarian food, but includes occasional exceptions such as red meat.
 Pescetarianism: A diet that is mainly vegetarian but also includes fish and sometimes other seafood.
 Pollotarianism: A diet that is mainly vegetarian but also includes poultry.

 Okay, then let's turn it around: I don't know what your professional background is, but let's say you are contributing to an article fully in line with your profession, and you'll literally see dozens of users engaging in edit wars reverting not only your own edits, but also well-informed edits made by others - all this going on for a couple of days. That's exactly when you guys (i.e. ADMINS) you should have a careful look: I'm not the problem, at most I am a symptom of it, because I was trying to be part of the solution by pointing out the aforementioned issues. The quality fluctations of that particular article have been severe, it seems that there's a huge mess of people editing without any relevant background knowledge whatsoever. This has nothing to do with elitism: wikipedia (or any encyclopedia) cannot just thrive through people without any domain expertise. And other users have been highlighting these issues, too - but were ignored because their criticism also affected wp admins. Really, you cannot expect high quality articles if the people """"writing"""" it are merely acting like robots adding refs to articles that they don't understand, let alone briefings that they never watched in the first place. Regarding the term jackass, just look at the Jackass article, it describes fairly well what's going on there, just because there's huge public interest in the event, which attracts countless people who don't even bother getting informed in the first place, and rather prefer edit warring instead. BTW: I am not trying to talk common-sense to you, like I said: I don't care about this account and/or IP being blocked or not - not even if it should not be temporary. The real issue here is lack of quality, and lack of wp admins enforcing rules to ensure a higher degree of quality.

 rework begun 

I suggest to rework the """"Initial theories"""" section along these line:

First
First I suggest to delete the Technical failure section and move the relevant information (that the plane was fine) to the Investigation section under a new title and with the following text:

 The Plane 

The aircraft, a Tupolev Tu-154M, construction number 90A837, was manufactured at Kuibyshev aviation plant (No. 18) on 29 June 1990 for the Polish Air Force.
It was one of two Tupolev Tu-154s that served as official government jets; this aircraft—with a tail number of 101—was for presidential use, while another—marked 102—is used by the prime minister. The aircraft had undergone a major overhaul in December 2009 and Aleksey Gusev, the head of the maintenance plant that carried out the work, told Polish TV that it should not have had technical problems. The airplane had received a 5-year/7500-flight-hour warranty after the overhaul yet the crash happened after just 138 flight hours.

Second
As second part of the rework I suggest to edit half of the VIP passenger syndrome section away and put the remaining paragraph last in the section Investigation:

There has been some speculation in the press, that the planes pilot was under pressure to land in Smolensk in spite of the averse weather conditions. These speculations were linked to an earlier event in August 2008, when another pilot of the 36th Special Aviation Regiment was pressured by president Kaczyński to land in Tbilisi during the South Ossetian war between Georgia and Russia. During that incident, Pietruczuk was asked by the president's staff to change the flight plan and land in Tbilisi. After consulting with the commander of his unit, Pietruczuk refused, justifying his decision by safety concerns. He was then visited in the cockpit by Kaczyński himself, who tried to convince him to change his mind. Kaczyński later told journalists: """"If someone decides to become an officer, they should not be cowardly"""". Nevertheless, Pietruczuk held his ground and the plane landed in Azerbaijan as planned. A few weeks after this incident Pietruczuk was decorated by the defense minister for following correct procedures in this case and keeping the safety of his passengers utmost in his mind. Pietruczuk continued to fly the president's plane after the incident, even after Kaczyński expressed unhappiness with his performance during the flight to Tbilisi.

Third
Thridly I would shorten the Instrument landing system incompatibility section, rename it and definitely delete the """"may be using"""" part and put the resulting section directly under the the section """"The",0.0

One more thought on this topic, which I think is very important. Although I instinctively feel All Blacks should be the name for this page, there is a real difference between the two names - the All Blacks aren't only, as  Cvene64 stated, """"the New Zealand Rugby Football Union First XV"""". The All Blacks were [until very recent tours] also the team which played non-international games on tour. Hence Zinzan Brooke, for example, has played 58 times [58 tests] for 'the New Zealand national team', and another 42 for the All Blacks. A quick look at the official All Blacks site  shows numerous players who have played several matches for the All Blacks but have never played for the New Zealand national team in an international match.

As the 2 names are not exactly equivalent, I have to agree with GordyB and Duncharris that strictly speaking we should not use All Blacks as the main name for this article. 13:13, 4 September""",0.0

Ok, hold up, there's two separate issues here. One is Brevik's use of the term and the other is the side bar.

With regard to the first one, the source appears to be RS. So the question, as with other sources, is whether it just mentions Brevik's use in passing or does it actually use it in context.

With regard to the side bar. I think Altetendekrabbe is correct that the inclusion of the discrimination sidebar is somewhat gratuitous and pov, and that if we include that sidebar we should also include the """"islamophobia"""" side bar and the """"myths"""" sidebar (is there one?). The inclusion of the discrimination side bar is obvious pov because, in sources, the term is described as faulty, insulting, neologism reflecting anti-Muslim sentiment more often than it is described as a proper word reflecting discrimination towards non-Muslims.

The homepage of the Anarchist Internatonal, www.anarchy.no , is not nonsensensial. Try to prove it and you will fail. The article Anarchist International on Wikipedia is objective and to the point. 

The organizations/networks associated to the Anarchist International are found at the link-page of www.anarchy.no , and then there is a big network of networkmembers/subscribers related to the different organizations/networks.

As for Zazaban I have problems with taking him seriously. In a discussion on Anarchism.net he answered with the following """"intelligent"""" and a bit ochlarchical statements: 
""""You're one to talk. - And, just to see how you react; FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK. FUCK FUCK. FUCK."""" Source . I would not put too much weight on what he means. I don't think such comments are funny.

 Bot automation at Wikipedia:Today's articles for improvement 

Over the past two weeks, there has been extensive discussion on introducing bot automation to assist with maintenance of the Today's Articles for Improvement project. A  has now been approved for trial and will carry out the weekly duties. The bots first run will occur around ' (midnight on Sunday).If you have been assisting any of the weekly maintenance tasks, please refrain from doing so this week. The bot needs to be tested and proven it can do the job, and it only gets one chance per week. The tasks will include:
 Adding the new scheduled article to Wikipedia talk:Today's articles for improvement and removing the entry from Wikipedia:Articles for improvement
 Set up the schedule pages for the new TAFI, except the adding of an image and caption
 Adding  to the new article for improvement, remove  from last week's article and add  to the talk page
 Notify relevant WikiProjects that the new TAFI is within their scope
 Send a mass message to everyone on the notification list of the new TAFI selection

Updating the accomplishments and archiving selections is still done manually, along with daily' tasks such as adding approved entries to the articles for improvement page. These will become automated in the near future.

We hope the bot proves to serve well, and by carrying out the routine housekeeping tasks we can boost the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the project.  thanks you for your service in helping with the weekly tasks in the past, and for your cooperation during this trial period )

Unfortunately, you are an undeniable feeble person who misrepresents reality of the Urantia Fellowship as someone who does not legitimately publish the Urantia Book and is a failure with only, as you say hundreds of members. The Urantia Readers-Intl has hundreds of readers worldwide in places such as Denmark, Saudi Arabia, Europe, Korea, etc. Your self repressed reality is necessary for you to get through each day of your bitter resentful life.

 Advice 
We cannot display copyright material, even temporarily. The blanking template on the article gives you a link to a temporary page where you can draft a new article. Please note that:
Minor rewording is not enough to avoid a breach of copyright - see Wikipedia:Copy-paste
You will need to establish notability, a requirement to have a Wikipedia article, which is not a matter of opinion but must be demonstrated by showing """"significant coverage in reliable sources that are independent of the subject."""" Significant means more than just listing-type mentions; reliable excludes Myspace, Facebook, blogs, places where anyone can post anything; independent excludes the subject's own website, affiliated ones and anything based on press releases. The notability standard for academics is explained at WP:Notability (academics).

Is it necessary to have this many pictures of NorthPark Center? Most major malls have only one picture of the mall, and NorthPark Center, being not too notable nationwide, has 5. Shrek05 14:31 26 Jun 2006

While NorthPark may not (yet) be notable nationwide, I don't see any reason not to have the pictures of the mall, for this reason:  the mall is the largest in Texas (at 2.35 million square feet) and one of the five largest in the US (according to the International Council of Shopping Centers).  Consequently, the pictures give readers of Wikipedia a view of how a quarter billion dollars was spent in its recent expansion.  With the 1.4-acre Center Park in the middle, NorthPark also becomes the only mall in the nation with a sizeable outdoor area for eating, playing or relaxing.  At one time, shortly after its opening by Raymond Nasher, the mall also held the distinction of being largest air-conditioned building in the entire world.
 

 picture rendering under Thunderbird looks all wrong 

The pictures on this page come out all wrong when viewed with Thunderbird (I'm using ver 1.5.0.4 under Windows XP).  It looks fine in Internet Explorer (v 6.0, same OS).  Looking at the page source, it seems like more of a problem with Thunderbird or the CSS for same, but I'm no web developer.  Leaving a note here in the hope that someone more skilled might find it and fix it.   

 Fountains 

It's been probably a year since I last visited, but one of the major interior architectural features has always been the fountain with colored lights, and another feature I can't describe well, sort of a mini-pond with a bridge. Unusual features worth mentioning very briefly. Incidentally, having looked at the existing pictures (only one of which is at all attractive or unique), I think we'd do better to find or snap a good picture of the fountains instead. (I'd have to look into whether there are any restrictions on taking pictures; I once had problems taking pictures inside a supermarket for my Spanish class (they thought I was some sort of corporate spy).

 Major Edit (3/26/2007) - Staff Email 

I contacted NorthPark Center staff asking them to release some images of the mall into GNU license, since the mall recently underwent construction and could use some new photos.  What I got in return was neither photos, nor permission, but a revised version of the Wikipedia article deemed to be factually correct by their staff.  (A full copy of the email is provided )

Most of the email has been transplanted into the article, with a few exceptions, as some parts did not meet Wikipedia's standards of notability or NPOV.

The biggest omission is the list of stores exclusive to NorthPark.  The information does not appear to be notable.

The introduction claims """"NorthPark Center is one of the top five shopping mall’s in the United States"""" but it appears to be outdated because the List of largest shopping malls in the United States would rank the mall as #7 in the US, based on Gross Leasable Area.  The infobox has been updated to match up with the International Council of Shopping Centers data, rather than the figures currently displayed on NorthPark Center's website.

  
There's still a lot that violates NPoV here. I slapped the neutrality tag on it.

Basically, the multi-propose Approval Voting we recently used, is designed precisely for that. Approve an alternative means approval, no vote to an alternative means oppose. The result gives that or those alternatives which have highest net voter number, just as Irpen wishes with """"approve & oppose"""". The only basic structural weakness of Approval Voting (if voters are honest) actually is that it is not designed to register priority order of a voter and thus not whether an individual approve vote is strong or weak. But even this can be made by enlightened voters, they just need to write """"weak approve"""" or """"strong approve"""" when voting for any alternative - and the interpretation will be the task of the interpreter. However, what happened with the (yet ongoing) vote is not due to weaknesses of the voting system, but due to the problem that our subject is difficult to name in a generally accepted way. She simply is difficult. There are reasonable, sufficiently-well-founded arguments her to be placed under headings which almost all make some to oppose. And thus the vote splits. This being the basic situation, NO VOTING SYSTEM will ever cure it - unless using """"violence"""". Of course a voting system could be designed which favors something and violates some others, and thus a decision will be made - against half of the population who are then totally pissed at. Such voting systems were used by dictators, by oligarchs, etc.
Personally, I am somewhat puzzled why not a higher number of people came and put their (perhaps secondary, or label """"weak"""") approval to """"Alexandra of Hesse"""" - but that is the result of the will of those voters.  """,0.0

"Nowadays we're living longer, so we need more money than previous generations once did.

That's why many people choose to enhance their State entitlement through a scheme set up by their employer, or with a personal pension. The money is invested by their pension provider on their behalf with the aim of building up a more substantial sum for retirement.

Tax advantages:
For every £1 you put in, the Government adds 22p (for the 2006/07 tax year) for basic–rate taxpayers. Higher-rate taxpayers can also re-claim an additional 18p (for every £1) via their tax return. If you're offered a company scheme you may be able to benefit from your employer's payments.

Pensions invest in different types of investments, including investments based on stocks and shares, which carry different levels of risk. The value of your investment can fall as well as rise and you may get back less then you pay in.

If you have a personal pension but stop paying into it, you could actually lose much of whatever you've already paid. For example by stopping paying into your fund, the charges may reduce your fund, meaning you could lose out when you retire. 

3 Simple Steps to Starting a Pension Account
You decide to save for retirement with a personal pension plan
You choose a provider, type of pension and the age you would like to retire at.
You begin making payments: These payments, up to 100% of your relevant UK earnings, will receive tax relief, normally at your highest rate.",0.0

A reply to the argument that Benazir Bhutto mispoke

Benazir was a highly intelligent, highly educated and ex-prime minister.  She is not George Bush.  She does not mispeak.  This is the biggest thing since watergate.  The proof that this is a cover up is shown by the following facts:

i) the experienced reporter David Frost who was interviewing Benazir when she """"slipped out"""" the fact that Bin Laden was murdered did not follow up on it.  In fact he looked palpably irritated and wondering quite how to paper over the issue.  He is in on the game, clearly.  If he was not in on the game then he would have pinned her down on this sensational bit of news.  

ii) Benazir was murdered in a wet job (this is a technical term) about a month after she mentioned that Omar Sheikh (note the triangle of first letters in history) was involved in Bin Laden's assasination.

iii) Nobody in the world's media picked up on a story that Bin Laden was murdered.

So blanket world media silence on the possibility of Bin Laden being dead.  I kinda have a source inside who confirms this.  Acutally it was years ago and not Omar Sheikh, but letters in names can sometimes be telling three times.""",0.0

That's not the case. You are one of MANY arrogant, conceited, self-absorbed losers that populate Wikipedia who use this site as some sort of self-esteem builder, because here you can act like a """"big man"""", and make unilateral decisions on what's acceptable or unacceptable here.

I have looked over the history of the page and at some times vandalism accounts for over 70% of contributions. So it isn't a case of might get vandalised but is getting vandalised all the time. At this stage I dread to think how many names on there legally could sue the posters over their inclusion. A quick glance spotted a couple. Robbie Williams, for example, has just won a defamation case yet we still had him in as debated when legally it has been ruled that there is nothing debatable about his orientation!!! Frankly, given the legal complexities with listing people here I'd go further and advocate that either the page be deleted as too much of a defamation risk, or be kept semi-protected to stop the constant adding in of vandalistic edits by anonymous editors who edit no pages but this one. It might be an idea to protect the page completely for a day while a couple of users sifted through all the names on it to make sure that there are no defamationary claims sitting there that weren't spotted by those honorable editors like Bearcat who spent their time constantly stopping vandalism here. But as vandalism is a constant reality, not merely a theoretical possibility, I think semi-protection is allowable here. \(caint) """,0.0

Edit war
Hallo.
There is a big discussion (at least 4 years old) about Marco Polo birhplace. There are 2 claims:
a) Marco Polo is born in Venice
b) Marco Polo is born in a small island, in present day Croatia.
a) is reported by all (I wrote all) works on Marco Polo, includuing all (I wrote all) the scholars. Marco Polo clearry wrote to be """"Venetian"""". He refer to Venice as his hometownHi. His father and granfather were Venetians, etc. etc...
b) is a fringe thheory. In about 4 years, not a single valid scientific source, was presented (see talk page).

User Brutal wants to impose a POV. This POV is to present the theory B as trust-able, on the same level of A, but he does not present sources. In the article is written that """"the exact birthplace (of Marco) is unknown"""". That is no true: all the scholars says """"born in Venice"""". Where does this claim come from? I was just asking a source. That why I've inserted CN tags, which are refused as a """"POV"""" by my antagonist. With no discussion!
Now, I', going (sadly) to start an edit war. This is the story (check here)
1) I start a new discussion on talk page 
2) Then, I insert CN tags 
4) I am reverted by B. (POV edits) 
5) I inform you
6) I warn the editor in his own talk page, asking to discuss in talk page.
7) I restore my edit 
Now my antagonist was supposed to discuss in the article talk page, but he refuse. According to me he broke the rules So that:
8) Brutal revert me without discussion
9) I inform you  (with this message)
10) I restore my edit.

By the way, Montanabw, you are effectively retarded. I can source everything I'm saying.

http://storyofkannada.blogspot.com/2008/05/origin-of-seuna-dynasty.html

Also till 1400 AD there were dynasties which claimed that they are yadavs. The descendants of this dynasties still would be living in India. Also the article mentions that only from 19th century yadavs are trying to raise their status. Its wrong. In 1400 AD a dyansty claimed they are yadavs ( chandravanshi ). These people cannot disappear just like that.

proof some scholars claim yadavs as khastriyas.

I do not know how far you up to date with the conflict that is keeping editors from editing the page. If not, I suggest you have a look at the arbitration case that is currently pending.  

To facilitate, this was the version most people (except Marcosantezana) could live with:

Natural selection is the process in which individual organisms that possess favourable traits are more likely to survive and reproduce.  Natural selection works on the phenotype, the outward form determined by genes (the genotype), the environment and the interaction between them. Only heritable variations in a trait will be passed on to the next generation and the frequency of favourable heritable traits will increase in subsequent generations. The underlying genetic variation in traits is the result of genetic processes, such as mutations and recombinations, and can undo the effect of natural selection if strong enough relative to the effect of natural selection. Natural selection, together with other mechanisms such as genetic drift and mutations, is an important component of evolution, a cornerstone of modern biological and medical research.

The term was introduced by Charles Darwin in 1859 in his book """"The Origin of Species"""", as an analogy with a farmer choosing individuals that possess desired characteristics for his breeding stock, which Darwin called artificial selection.

Maybe you find it not god, and in that case, I am curious what you think of that.

1. Inline citations are not required by policy

No policy requires inline citations. They are often a good idea, and are a requirement for feature article status, but it is not a requirement for all articles. Furthermore, the tag is often used when the article has adequate sources. This tag therefore enshrines a particular editor's view about style (that the article in question should have inline citations) in an inappropriate way. That point belongs on the talk page, not in the article itself. Robert A.West (Talk) 

    Where does it say that featured articles have different requirements then other articles? Jeepday 

        The whole point in to get citations for all articles so that they meet the WP:V requirements, I have noticed that tags quite often help by bringing this to attention of users, particularly new-ish users. Cheers SeanMack 

            I agree with Jeepday and SeanMack. Our ultimate goal should be for every article to be of FA quality.  Satori Son

Except that's not whats going on here at all. It should be pretty apparent at this point from the lack of actual help Greg has given to BLPs that he really doesn't care about them. It is a convenient issue that he can make noise about. Since many Wikipedians are (understandably) very concerned about BLPs if he claims that's what he really cares about he can sound far more concerned. It should be very telling that Greg didn't pick up claiming about BLPs until very late. It was never an issue for him until well after he was blocked. He's simply found a convenient thing that he can use to make his behavior seem more acceptable. If he really cared he'd point out to us the various problems.,0.0

 Homeopathy 

The reference to the term """"Homöopathie"""" being first published in 1807 is on page 263 of the Dean article (page 9 of the pdf), although his referencing is a little convoluted - it cites an article called """"Fingerzeige auf den homöopathischen Gebrauch der Arzneien in der bisherigen Praxis"""", referring to ref. 52 which itself refers back to ref. 24 which has it published in Hufeland’s Journal, xxvi (1807), 5–43.  

I'll reword the """"Hahnemann's concept"""" section to include Hahnemann's use of the term """"doctrine of specifics"""" and reference Dudgeon.

I've noticed there's a short """"to do"""" list on the Homeopathy talk page which I might try to work on now that things have quietened down over there.  Do you know of any good but reasonably concise sources (preferably available online) for:

i) the concept of healing crisis in the context of homeopathy;
ii) the work of Constantine Hering and James Tyler Kent and how it differs from Hahnemann?

Notes for the blind communist Castro lovers editing wikipedia and for the man himself

There seems to be a group of people around here in wikipedia with very strong leftist tendency that are very blind as to no recognize Castro for what he is. But not to worry. History will take care of him like it took care of Hitler and Stalin and other horrible dictators the people in the world have suffer.
There is a lot of talk in wikipedia about having a neutral POV but there is no such thing here. All the Castro's agents and lovers are here polishing his image probably getting paid with free vacations by the dictator at Varadero beach in Cuba while many true Cuban heroes die in prison just for opposing Castro and what he represents. A decadent regime, a waste of time for the Cuban people. 
Castro I know you or your agents will read this. So do not worry. History will take care of you and be assure that you will not look this good as it appear here. 
You could have been great a great leader if you had help Cuba get out of a dictator like Batista and then surrender power to the people to democracy! 
But you want to know something. You became worst than Batista the moment you started killing many innocent people just at the beginning of the revolution. You yourself killed the revolution with all the blood and with your unlimited greed for power. 
You claim Cuba is the most democratic country in the world. 

""""Right""""!How many people prefer to die on the tooth of a shark better than at your hands? How many desperate people abandon the  island? Because there is no other choice? or maybe because they are anyway dying an slow death at the hands of your regime, controlling every little bit of information as you an your agents are doing here at wikipedia. Cleaning up your image! 
It amazes me. Because this goes to show what you are. A megalomaniac! too worry about what history will tell about you, about what your legacy will be.
Do not worry Fidel Castro. I will let you know this. Do not even let yourself think for a second that you are at the same level as Jose Marti, Feliz Varela or even a Simon Bolivar. 
You do not get even up one inch in front of them in fact I can tell you that you go down for miles and miles.  
You must be full of envy about Chavez! because his got the oil money you never had! and because of it he can buy some people. But do not be! Some people are not for sale. Some people will not buy the lies you sell.
This is for you, all the leftist who have never live in a totalitarian regime, and who fantasize about Castro and Che I will also be sorry to disappoint you by telling you that you Castro that you are not  even at Che's level, yes the same one you made a martyr, an icon of the revolution, Your first patron saint. The same one you sell in t-shirts and postcards now and you profit from! 
That is because at least Che had principles, something you really do not know what it is or even fathom, 
he(Che) probably believe in communism and that it was a good thing because of his youth, while on the other hand you Castro  just used it for your own personal benefit and profit.

Ask yourself why Che die? why Camilo Cienfuegos die? and many others close to power in Cuba?

Many people said that Castro himself send someone to kill him! He just can not stand someone close to power(because he is very afraid to loose it he is paranoid about it,obsess with power , anybody close to him have to be very careful no to upset him or to contradict any of his ideas even the bad ones. Poor guys, I am sorry for them. 
 
Castro have subjugated and dominated the Cuban people who have suffer for years without end his power and very long rants. But no more.. Just like everything that is born some day you too Fidel Castro will also die sooner or later. Do not worry, when you die we the Cubans enjoying freedom will not celebrate your death but will rejoice about the change that will happen to our homeland after you will be gone. Sorry to see all the time wasted but not to worry. Cuba will be rebuild. All the Cuban blood you have spilled in and out of the country will not be in vane. You know why that will be? Because, Cubans will have learn their lesson. 

For you, all the leftist who have never live in a totalitarian regime, believe me if you impartially read all the news about Fidel Castro and check all his speeches from the very beginning of the revolution you can see his evolution. How power have corrupted him and his regime. How many innocent people have been kill in the name of the revolution? how much intolerance! how many times he has sell out his """"principles"""".

The restored wording seems over-simplified.  It ignores the Council's attribution to the college of the bishops of the same powers that it attributes also to the Pope alone.  The Pope has within the college or body of the bishops a position analogous to that which Peter had within the college or body of the apostles.  It was to the college or body of the apostles, with Peter as its head, that Christ gave authority over the Church.  It is the college or body of the bishops, with the Pope as its head, that has succeeded to that authority.  Schreck does not deny this.  The Pope's position needs to be mentioned, but the position of the bishops as a body must also be mentioned.    
Thank you for your comments. Do you have a reference for your position above? I just want the article to be factually correct so I am using the information provided in the Nihil obstat Imprimatur declared source by Prof. Alan Schreck which states on page 159 (author cites Lumen Gentium 22 and Catechism para 882 for the following): """"For the Roman Pontiff, by reason of his office as Vicar of Christ, and as pastor of the entire Church has full, supreme, and universal power over the whole Church, a power which he can always exercise unhindered."""" That seems pretty clear to me and supports the article text in the lead describing him as the leader of the church.

Reply to vandal Wakkeenah
To all the vandals and so called just administrators, the air dates are minor problems, the facts and details surrounding Reeves suicided are not being written well enough, as everybody else is reporting, the fact that Reeves was to fight Moore next day, is also being reverted, this is pure vandalism. As far as spelling goes by Vesa or Projects or whoever, well, if you keep on repeating yourself and have no time, some spelling errors might occur, but it's not the spelling that counts but content which is being vandalised by so called just users and administrators of this so called just wikipedia. And it is obvious wahkeenah has some personal interest in this, proof: All over internet we have Reeves' death explained in detail and possible people involved, but over here he is taking everything down, the idiotic administratotors are reversing it, thus making themselves look stupid and ignorant by not realizing the historical facts.""",0.14285714285714285

"Good intentions 

Hi Yan,

I fail to see the good intentions of your friend Jayjg coming into play in Talk:Beta Israel. Plenty of editors have expressed their opinion that the relevant section should either be removed or entirely rewritten. By your advice I've suggested to bring the endless debate to a fruitful conclusion by rewriting it myself. I thought there was an agreement on that at his talk page. Now your friend sets me deadlines I did not agree to and pretends he doesn't see the other editors who disagree with him.

I would appreciate it if you could step in to end this childish behaviour. We're here to write articles, not to win arguments, neither by head counts nor with lies. Thanks,",0.0

"THIS ARTICLE SHOULD BE DELETED!!! 

I cannot believe that people are so deluded to think that this guy Richard Kastle deserves a damn wikipedia page. 

Why not give every single person who plays piano a page of their own... HELL, why not let anyone just put up a page about themselves. Not only was he previously featured in a video DAMNING deceased pianists about their playing (accusing them of simplifying the ending octave section of Liszts 2nd Hungarian Rhapsody), but hasn't done anything to deserve any special credit. Apart from his compositions which truly aren't anything brilliant - in fact, they're almost bland and boring (from a compositional point of view), he seems to ride on the credit of having played two compositions brilliant (which seems to be the deluded, sick, biased opinion of a guy called MikeCaffey on YouTube) when in fact his playing is sloppy and usually completely drowned in pedal, completely disturbing the balance of sound in the music. 

Now this deluded, sick individual on YouTube (MikeCaffey) seems to go about praising Dick (short for Richard, and far more funny to refer him to that, than Richard) for his compositions, deleting valid posts by real pianists and piano players alike, possibly in an effort to sweeten the image of Dick to others. As a pianist myself, I can safely say that playing the end of Liszts Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 in c sharp minor brilliantly does not alleviate ones status to piano-god, and even if it did Dick STILL wouldn't be a piano God since he seems intent on drowning the ending with pedal, completely destroying the cleanliness of the parading octaves. 

Letting this slanderous leech of the musical world have a wikipedia page seems insulting to other pianists who truly have talent. Although they may not care whether they have a page or not, I find it insulting to the profession of pianism that Dick has a page of his own.

 INCONSISTENCIES 

On the two narratives of the Creation Story (Gen. 1:1-2:4a and 2:4b-25), please notice the following inconsistencies:
a. In the first narrative, man was created on the sixth day where man the last of God's creation. On the second narrative, notice that man was first to be created.
b. In the first narrative, all other creatures (birds, fishes, animals, plants, etc.) created before the creation of man where man created at the same time; both Adam and Eve while in the second narrative, note that Adam was first to be created then followed by the garden in Eden and then by the animal creatures. When none proved to be the suitable partner for man, it was only then that Eve was created where Eve the last to be created.
c. In the second narrative, the LORD GOD used the possessive pronoun I (""""I will make a suitable partner for man"""") while in the first narrative, when GOD created man, GOD said """"Let US create man...""""
d. Note that in the first narrative, God created all things using His word (Let there be...) while in the second narrative, Lord God created all creatures including man """"out of the (clay of the) ground"""".
e. In the first narrative, everyday of creation was always concluded with the phrase """"God saw (his creation) that it was good"""" while on the second narrative, the Lord God said """"IT IS NOT GOOD for man to be alone"""" considering it is He himself who created the man that is alone. Believe it or not, it is was a mistake. It then brings us to inquiring whether or not the creation of EVE in the original plan when the narrative suggests that had God did not mistakenly created man to be lonely, Eve could not have been created. Note further that the first choice of the Lord God to be the partner of man was animals. Upon notice of man's loneliness, God created different animals (2:19)and the purpose of their creation is to present them to Adam for man to choose which of those animals he may like be his suitable partner. Eve was actually the second choice after Adam rejected animals. Hence the question again, does God know what he was doing? It seems the creation process a matter of TRIAL AND ERROR. And true enough, EVE is a product of ERROR.
e. Bible scholars are one in the agreement that the second narrative was written way ahead of the first narrative. Gen 2 (the second story of creation) is therefore the original creation story. But why was it written A POSTERIORI the first narrative. Please consider the same parallel confusion of sequence in the first two books of the New Testament. Mark is an older Gospel than Matthew but chronology seem to follow the same confusion between the two stories of creation in the book of Genesis. 

 IRREGULARITIES 
a. On the first day of creation, God created LIGHT. On the fourth day, God separated the light that guides the day from the light that guides the night and all other stars and heavenly bodies. Question is; when did God created the SUN? Was it on the first or the fourth day. If it's the latter, what light did He create on the first day?
b. It is not correct to call the garden Eden. The correct text states (2:8) """"LORD GOD planted a garden in Eden"""". Eden is the place where the garden was planted and not the garden itself. The narrative even mentioned the location of the garden being """"East of Eden"""".
c. Note that in the 2:5, it was stated """"the Lord God had not sent RAIN upon the earth"""". Question: when was rain created?
d. Please check the absurd narrative of Chapter 6 about the Nephilim. SONS OF GOD marrying daughters of man and producing sons who were the heroes of the past and the popular men?"""" Huhhh?
e. It seems disenchanting to consider God a SUPREME ALL POWERFUL BEING but possesses the human frailty of REGRET; (6:6) And the LORD was sorry that he had made humankind on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart.
f. NOTE: GEN 1, the creator was GOD. In GEN 2 and 3, it was the LORD GOD. In 4 to 50, its the LORD.

 Apology to Jeremy 

Hi Jeremy,
Recently I made some rather derogatory remarks referring explicity to your homosexuality, sexual activity with those of the same gender, your race, the objects that you may or may not insert into your bodily cavity, and your inability to perform the act of fellatio at a satisfactory level. I also made some comments demanding that you orally consume my feces, and then perform fellatio, at an unsatisfactory level, to even myself. The list continues, of course, on and on and on. I also failed ot cite any source giving proof of your behaviour, and for that I am ashamed. 
So I am extending my apology to you for my explicit and coarse language, and next time I have any conflcit with you, I will definitely go abuot it in a more productive manner. I will not call you demeaning names like """"faggot, nigger, kike, cocksucker, faggot, asshole, son fo a bitch, faggot, motherfucker etc"""".
I am sincerely embarassed of my behaviour, and after reflecting I know the inappropriateness of it all. Please accept my apology, and know that whatever your lifestyle, I did not mean for my comments to be taken personally.
Sincerely,
Michelle Rollins""",0.14285714285714285

 delusion zone 

why is the article allowed to survive in this state? it apparently gets a POV pass by badly impersonating sardonic writing. most of the article is overt advocacy of a point of view (case making), beginning with an unsourced, ethereal claim that """"[t]here is no evidence [for cow tipping as described,] aside from (mostly unreliable) eyewitness reports"""". what is a """"(mostly unreliable) eyewitness"""" report? what about the part that is reliable? weasel words.

i don't think cows can be tipped either, but this is hardly an article that meets wikipedia policy/guidelines/standards for clarity, neutrality, or good writing. the second paragraph, for example, is badly written, pretend-intellectual humoro-babble for the sole purpose of setting up the inclusion of the cutesy, unnecessary phrase """"precarious ruminants"""". the refrigerator example is strained, nowhere mentioning center of gravity. rather, it encourages a lower center of gravity than an honest attempt to simulate a cow would have, while making sure to reduce the lever. that's just the start. i would hack/slash my way through the thing, but i can tell from the history that it's the pet of some watching worshipers.

i hope nobody involved in creating/preserving this article ever marks anything at wikipedia as POV, original research, or unencyclopedic. wikipedia is not the farm team for the wannabe dave barry squad. and yes, that includes the useless pic caption. the prime criterion of a wikipedia article element is not how funny you think it is.

After the collapse of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, there was a certain resurgence of Ustaše symbology coinciding with the residual hate from the recent war. This phenomenon was mitigated with the passing of legislation by the Croatian government banning Ustasha symbols and associated references.

The reasons for the change include:
 There is no evidence of resurgence in ideology, but lots of evidence of increase use of symbology especially around areas that suffered heavy casualties and devastation during the war - thus the adjustment to reflect this fact;
 No evidence of paramilitaries adopting the ideology - I do not count HOS in that group who had a Party of Rights agenda as opposed to an Ustasha agenda - often the two get confused as the same b/c the Ustasha was an offshoot of the party of rights and there was some crossover in political goals e.g. independent Croat state; notion of historical territory ;

Whatever one calls it ...

ALL energy available to man other than nuclear (fission or fusion, fission includes geothermal) ultimately derives from the sun, currently or in the (distant) past.  Solar energy from the distant past became stored in fossil fuels and is utilized by man via one or another technique of mining followed usually by combustion.  

That energy which is NOT so stored and which can be obtained without mining its source  that is, in more or less real time, used roughly at the same rate as it becomes available  is the subject of this article.  

I do not think that it is all that constructive to parse definitions quite so acutely as is being done, for example, in this """"Talk"""" section.

WP:OVERLINKING policy on Wikipedia:Generally, a link should appear only once in an article, but if helpful for readers, links may be repeated in infoboxes, tables, image captions, footnotes, and at the first occurrence after the lead. If an article of 1,000 lines has a link repeated on line 600 there is no objection to keep te second link. A link repeated three times in the same paragraph is just plain overkill. Any undesirable future edits (removal of templates) should be adressed by closely monitoring your watchlist, not placing an excessive amount of duplicate links.
 ...is to keep everything in a format that is uniform with everything... In my opinion, that's just impossible. Imperial versus metric, inch versus foot and inch, alphabetic versus historical order, etc. Using other units for Railgauge templates than its corresponding categories and article titles makes it harder to recognise a particular Railgauge when editing or reading text, especially for people accustomed to metric systems. When the list of track gauges, navbox track gauges, article titles and categories all mention 3ft 6in it is odd to use the devious 42in RailGauge template. Moreover, the Railgauge templates are only for conversion purposes and not intended for sorting lists by size or alphabet. Uniformity for the sake of uniformity serves no purpose.
Taking WP:NPOV, in particular WP:BALASPS in consideration, Rail transport in Disney Parks is not less or more significant than a randomly chosen rapid transit rail system, famous heritage railway, abandoned railway or extensively used common carrier railway.

"The location of Suleyman Shah's tomb is a sovereign territory of Turkey according to France-Turkey 1921 Agreement. Syria obeyed and still obeys that agreement, and since 1921 every sovereignty symbols (Flags, Soldiers, etc.) of Turkey appeared on that territory. When Syria-Turkey border is drawn in 1921, the border separated some villages into two. The naming of most of these villages currently are like that: the part of the villages in Turkey's side is named in Turkish. The parts of the villages in Syria's side is named as the Arabic of the Turkish name or the original Turkish name was protected but with Arabic spelling. This is valid for the new place of the tomb as well: Turkish Eşme (Esme) is in Turkey's side, Syrian Ashma is in Syrian side. Turkey transferred sovereignity of 10000 m2=0.01 km2 territory together with the tomb in Qaraqozak inside another place within Syria (i.e., Syrian Ashma; 200 m from Turkey-Syria border). The Turkish flag is raised in Ashma (200 m from the Turkey-Syria border). The corpses of Suleyman Shah is temporaly in Turkey. When the grave and tomb in Ashma is finished, the corpse of Suleyman Shah will be transferred to Ashma. Hence, sovereign territory was exclave of Turkey, now it is juxtapositioned to Turkey.
 The current change of Suleyman Shah's tomb is not the first change of the sovereign territory within Syria. Due to several reasons (new dams affecting the tomb etc.), sovereign territory of Turkey within Syria was changed earlier many times: 1. From original place to the Caber Castle. 2. From Caber Castle to Qaraqozak village. 3. From Qaraqozak village to Ashma. In all of these changes, sovereignity of Turkey was protected. i.e. Only Turkish flag, Turkish soldiers can be located in that 0.01 km2 territory. 

 In http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Syrian_Civil_War_detailed_map#Ashma , there must be a symbol of tomb must be put. And, Ashma must be indicated as Turkey's territory.212.174.38.3",0.0

I'm highly amazed by the fact that this debate rages on. If I may interject, Aleta formed a subsection entitled Arbitrary Page Break. Note using the word Arbitrary over say, Random? Are we going to throw a huge fuss over the inclusion of a more sophisticated word? Sobriquet is quite clearly at least somewhat different from Nickname, otherwise there would be only one article encompassing both words. My suggestion is per a growing trend on Wikipedia: Link sobriquet to a definition in Wiktionary, should one exist. This saves readers the hassle of going through an entire article trying to summarily grasp the full definition of one word within an article comprised of several thousand such words. Furthermore, if Wikipedia is meant to be an informal learning tool of sorts, why fear incorporating a higher grade-level vocabulary into it as a means of providing the best possible learning experience? And if we have to """"dumb down"""" a word here, the same precedent would theoretically have to be set for the entire English Wikipedia, thereby degrading the quality of articles. As someone pointed out, if readers cannot grasp the lingusitics of the standard English wikipedia, there's Simple English to cater to that need. So, that's my offer for a solution. Dictionaries are as important of a resource as an encyclopedia and complement one another: Get the information you want and if you don't know what a word means, just look it up.

It's all done by the import companies themselves. The companies who import the material choosing to omit depictions of crucifixion for fear of censorship or backlash is not actually censorship.  I object to it being included on the page because it's stupid and it adds nothing, not because I think it should be censored.  Some Sailor Moon fan is getting up in arms about this over nothing.  It isn't notable or significant.  The cited source about that particular episode confirms it.  'We just did it because it looks cool' means that the people who created the image in the first place had no deeper motivation for creating it.

This whole conversation is rediculous as the colors on a flag are meant to represent different ideas or ideals. What we decide to call that color has everything to do with what is meant by that color. By calling it yellow one is neglecting to fully appreciate the meaning behind the choice of gold as a flag color is meant to convey an idea, that of eternal and original wealth and prosperity. It has nothing to do with being high and mighty regarding the naming of a color. That is a reactionary and frankly stupid position to hold. Flags are symbols meant to illustrate various ideas and they use images and colors, like all other forms of symbolism, to do this.

Blocking me
I dont understand you're motivation for blocking me. You say I made personal attacks and the link I followed was the Qiyamah talk page..I presume you mean my comment that Universaliss was vandalizing it. Im not sure if you were confused or simply refrained from viewing his last two edits. His last two edits were what motivated me to my accusation. He replaced the page with utter nonsense. After you blocked me you didnt even rv his vandalism! I assume your decision to block me was an accident...but it does seem suspect...especially considering your recent and persistent need to engage me in convos which really dont concern you (Woohookity and that vfd consensus). I read your comment at southerncomfort's talkpage and I think you should know that I have not mislead her as i have never talked to this user. You said you blocked universaliss for a week...do you mean you blocked him/her yesterday and this will last for a week? No matter. I simply want that user to stop 1. reverting to old-outdated versions of the page which contain grammatical and technical inaccuracies, 2. stop the personal attacks, and religious attacks (towards Protestants, Jews, and Ahmadis), 3.and stop deleting information that he/she disagrees with. I really dont think this is asking that much. In terms of diffusing the situation...I tried to add in a passage that all parties could agree to.

"Accusations of sockpuppetry 

To whom it may concern,

I would like to express my disgust at being accused of sockpuppetry. The accusation made by ChrisCh is baseless simply because more than myself have pointed out their objections to his extreme censorship of the Padua College wikipedia listing. I would further like to add my anger that a Wikipedia newcomer, Freedomfighter1112, has been indefinitely blocked for expressing his point-of-view. The actions taken by  and subsequently  I feel are actually in violation of Wikipedia's policy of not attacking the newcomers. It should be assumed that, in good faith, that Freedomfighter1112 would hope to assist the Wikipedia community in a positive way; however, with the actions taken by the two users mentioned previously, he/she has been prohibited from being able to accomplish this desire. We must remember that everyone makes mistakes, and mistakes are meant to be forgiven - especially in the case of a person's first edit. I would like to say only once - I DO NOT KNOW, OR HAVE ANY CONNECTION WITH FREEDOMFIGHTER1112 AND THAT THE ACCUSATION OF SOCKPUPPETRY IS BASELESS AND THE INDEFINITE BLOCK PLACED AGAINST FREEDOMFIGHTER1112 SHOULD BE OVERTURNED IMMEDIATELY.

Sincerely Yours,

"This article isn't about religion, it's about persecution. Whether an atrocity is founded in scripture or practice doesn't matter. Anyway, in most religions, scripture doesn't necessarily dictate religious practice, that's not even the case with religions that have more literalist approaches to religious life, such as Islam. Many things Muslims do as a practice of religion are outside of the Qur'an. I imagine the same is true for Hinduism. Anyway, we don't have the authority to go into that level of analysis. If we had to contrast what a source says regarding what's 'religiously sanctioned', against actual scripture, we'd be engaging in original research. We'd be pretending that we're religious scholars. I found a reliable source that said something, and I edited accordingly.
 Because of all the wikilawyering here, I'm having to almost quote my sources without violation copyright. The source called it 'religiously sanctioned', and that's the phrase I used.

Writing new guidelines that general folks understand
18-July-2009: These recent events have just re-confirmed what I've been telling people for years: Wikipedia runs on mobocracy, despite other people claiming (for years), """"No, no, WP decisions are made per logical reasoning, in accordance with written policies"""". Well, actually, that's not how decisions have been made, for several years, as of July 2009. I'm not quite sure what the problem is with the wiki-masses, in this attitude, that """"truth"""" is a popularity contest. There can't be a massive, multi-year wiki-cabal, so I suspect these mob-judgments are simply what happens when ordinary folk are challenged to think.Many school teachers have concluded that thinking must be taught to most people. In America, people are not allowed, typically, to become official judges without some type of formal judicial education, where they must pass standards of clear thinking. Not just anyone can sit on the bench, and start making decisions that affect thousands of other people.We have to write reality-based guidelines, with totally obvious examples, so that anyone could understand them. The wiki-masses don't follow concepts such as """"significant coverage"""" in reliable sources: I must conclude the current WP policies are like wiki-calculus for the masses. They cannot calculate wiki-integrals of the policies to reach a logical conclusion. Hence, the current policies are a failure for coordinating general editors.So, these bogus AfD discussions are such a waste of time, re-hashing misunderstandings as confirmed by popularity votes. We have to write policy essays to explain actual examples to be followed: I don't think there's any other hope. Most people just don't understand the current policy points, no matter how carefully that text is quoted in discussions. They see """"NOTINHERITED"""" and that's the extend of their reading: 2 words is a policy to them. Perhaps they started to read the policy text (yawn) and re-zoned to the 2 words, period.

To be readable, we must list obvious examples, such as the one-event R.M.S. Titanic generating """"50"""" notables. Plus, those examples must be listed in easy-to-read essays (no consensus required), so when we put """"WP:BIGEVENT"""" they know that, historically, big single events have generated numerous notables (e.g.: Lee Harvey Oswald & Jack Ruby in JFK assassination; Charles Manson & Manson family in Sharon Tate/etc. murders). It's the only way to defeat the notion that exceptions, to the intricate policies, must be determined by intense debates of popularity votes. No, instead, big-event notability can be explained by a simple essay of examples. We need those policy essays to shift the mass voting. -  """,0.0

 legends pertaining to Mucalinda 

I have heard and read from several sources a story which elaborates on the Mucalinda legend.  According to this story, the Buddha was pleased with his protector and blessed him by placing a hand on his hood.  As a sign of the Buddha's blessing, cobras bear his fingerprints on their hoods.  Indian or Spectacled cobras (Naja naja) of course have two ocelli or eyespot markings on the back of their hood.  (These are thought to serve as """"eyes in the back of the head,"""" with the adaptive function of deterring predators that might try to attack the standing cobra from behind).  This story may be told in Thailand also, although there is a slight inconsistency in that Thai cobras (Naja kaouthia) have only one spot. )

I have also heard a variant in which the Buddha was protected by the serpent not from rain storms but from the blazing Indian sun.

Unfortunately, I cannot find a decent source for either of these elements in the Mucalinda story and do not know where they originated. 174.111.242.35  """,0.0

"Greetings 

Hi, Cirt - I hope you will consider stopping accusing me of bad faith editing. If you have any qualms with particular edits, I'd love to hear what is wrong with them and how my approach can be improved. 

I'd like to direct your attention to two quotes on user pages. The first is from Jimmy Wales:

== You can edit this page! ==

Really, you can! If you would like to, please feel free to do so. Make an edit – or even several! After all, that is what Wikipedia is all about.''

And the second is from Neelix's user page:

Wikipedia is thoroughly, inherently collaborative. In the humanities division of academia, we still hold to the ideal of the lone genius, expecting that each humanities scholar be the sole author of his or her journal articles. In the sciences and social sciences, we expect that there be two or three authors for each journal article. On Wikipedia, every well-developed article has many more than three authors. The result is an ever-increasingly accurate approximation of objectivity. This objectivity is not the pseudo-objectivity that results from ignoring our biases as authors, but is rather the result of diverse perspectives all being covered proportionally through discussion between people who have those diverse perspectives. We write better when we write together.

I think those principles are pretty neat. And I am certain my editing adheres to them. If you'd like to contact me off the site, let me know - I'd be happy to share ways to get in touch.",0.0

Well, there was a hot war going on in the background of TYOLD (the Konfrontasi) - the whole """"Living Dangerously"""" line was based around Sukarno's words ushering in of hot conflict against Malaysia, UK, etc. But on the point of Indonesian Civil War - at least at the beginning of '65, there was indeed some combat between the """"G30S"""" forces and those loyal to Suharto. I'm of the opinion that the period of combat was brief, and that after Jakarta was seized by Nasution-Suharto loyalists the casualties were very lopsided - hence, why the PKI's Central Committee-in exile called it just a """"White Terror."""" 

But of course, however, the same group criticized Aidit for not adhering to Mao's """"People's War"""" doctrine - so one could imagine that there were those sectors of the PKI that were spoiling for a conflict. Hence, I titled it Indonesian Civil War rather than Indonesian White Terror or Indonesian Coup - it keeps things NPOV and open to different scholarly interpretations.

By, I should point out that I have an interesting hard copy """"self critical"""" document the PKI Central Committee published from China detailing what they perceived as their mistakes in '65 and attempts to re-establish the Party.

 Alto Adige/South Tyrol 

I replied to your message on the page.  Look, you don't even know me, nor do I you.  I can respect your point of view on things, but I'd appreciate that you respect my desire for a compromise.  I finally see your statement above about San Francisco.  Can't you see that you are letting your personal politics get involved with the naming of a page on English Wikipedia?  I'm sorry, but whatever the history, Alto Adige is actually the more commonly used name in the United States.  Also, as a Ladin myself, of US origin, I have no desire to play this Italian versus German game.  History is what it is, and to be honest, the Ladin speakers were there WAY before anyone was speaking Italian in the region, or when Germans migrating to the area.  So, to me even Sudtirol is from an alien authority, if you want to be entirely accurate.  But why this constant ethnic tension in Europe?  Sudtirol sounds nice, Tyrol is nice, Alto Adige is nice.  From someone looking into the Province of Bolzano, what I feel I'm seeing is some really radical politics.  I've been told by friends in Trentino that """"Italians"""" don't feel welcome there.  Ironic, because you know the Italian speakers of Trentino are actually Ladin too.  They didn't suddenly appear out of thin air, you do remember Italian is a national language that came over the Italic peninsula some century ago, right?""",0.0

 A hit list for Jews 
There is a site called Jew Watch out there (I'll let you find the link) which specialises in """"keeping an eye on Jewish activities"""".  It is used as a reference site by anti-semites the world around.  Jew Watch makes it a point to make sure that they do not, under any circumstances, list someone who they cannot confirm 100% is Jewish.  Stormfront, a white supremist web forum, uses Jew Watch all of the time.

The criteria for inclusion on List of British Jews is the same criteria used by Jew Watch.  It is a criteria designed for anti-semites.  It is a criteria that is aimed in hurting Jews.

Jewish communities do not have such a criteria.  They allow anyone to be considered to be a Jew if they have any linkage with the Jewish community, through race, religion or culture.  This is the normal criteria that is used.  If your father is Jewish, then per Jewish community standards, you are Jewish.  And so forth.

Wikipedia as a whole has certain criteria for verifiability.  But these criteria are not being applied to this list.  This is being changed purely because this is a Jewish list.  Whilst Slim Virgin and her friends have claimed that this is in order to stop muslim terrorists, this is plainly not true.  If we are worried about terrorists strapping bombs to their bodies and blowing up Jews, then this list shouldn't exist at all.  And we should especially not try to focus on who are the """"real Jews"""".  Wikipedia are changing their rules, purely to push an anti-semetic point of view.  And while Slim Virgin goes around claiming that others who oppose her are neo-nazis, and ignoring their strong ties to the Jewish community, she herself has been unable to answer the questions about her own religious hatred.  And this is the same person who has supported muslim POV pushers, who have written vehement anti-semetic text throughout Wikipedia.  Slim Virgin has been a catalyst for banning people who have opposed these islamofascists.  Slim Virgin is an anti-semite.

Right now, I would encourage deletion of this list.  It is being run by anti-semites and used to harm all Jewish people.  Until such time as Slim Virgin can be banned from editing this and related pages, it is dangerous to continue to have such a page.  It is encouraging hatred of Jews.""",0.14285714285714285

Just as a point of clarification, I think we all have to keep in mind the difference between a reliable result and a valid claim.  I don't think it would be possible to claim that g is not a reliable result - as Bpesta said, it's been replicated far too many times to say it's just an artifact.  The debate is over what this reliable result means (e.g. which theoretical claim about the underlying cause of the effect is valid), and that is a complex, multi-sided, yet-to-be-resolved-if-ever question.  Frankly, I doubt science will have a decent answer to that question until it has a more analytic definition of what intelligence is (and being a bit of a developmentalist myself, I suspect that that definition will be much more subtle than can be captured by a simple measure like IQ), but as it stands, the best we are going to be able to do with this section is discuss g in its basics,and then lay out various interpretations with proper attributions, so that it doesn't look like the section is advocating any one amongst the several competing ideas.

"Chapter Nine
In chapter nine Burlington, Vermont Kolbert writes about Burlington, Vermont’s largest city. Years ago the citizens decided to stand up to global warming by using less power instead of buying more. The mayor of Burlington, Peter Clavelle, who has been mayor since 1989, came up with a program that encourages contractors to engage not in demolition but in “deconstruction”. This helps the city save energy by reducing waste and cutting down the need for new materials. Burlington’s electric department (BED) has a wind turbine that provided enough power for thirty homes and gets half of its energy from renewable sources, such as its 50 megawatt power plant that runs off of wood chips. The BED also leases compact florescent light bulbs for twenty cents a month because a family who uses these bulbs can cut their electricity bill by 10 percent. The city of Burlington estimates that their energy saving projects over the course of this lifetime will prevent the release of 175,000 tons of carbon. Burlington residents also eat locally and have turned old waste sites into an assortment of community gardens and cooperatives, the waste from these gardens is taken to a composting factory, and turned back into soil, making this process “closed loop”. Clavelle’s plan has begun to pick up across America beginning with Greg Nickles, the mayor of Seattle, who created a set of principles called the “US Mayors Climate Protection Agreement”. This agreement has been signed by over a hundred and seventy mayors, representing about thirty – six million people. This agreement is trying to prove how much can be done at the local level and Clavelle hopes that more cities will adopt this plan.",0.0

While the idea that the UK is the instigator of the war is delightfully odd, the OP does have a point - the article briefly alludes to the existence of earlier bombing (first para, """"Change of strategy"""") but never explicitly mentions it. However, the official history does explicitly connect the August raids to the start of the Blitz, even if they weren't the sole reason:

It would, of course, be too much to see in these raids on Berlin the whole cause of Hitler's next move; but they unquestionably added to his anger at the activities of Bomber Command. it would not be long now before D-day. What better policy, then, for this final phase, than to enjoy a swift and sweet revenge by hurling the Luftwaffe in force against London. For if the British capital could be reduced to chaos, the task of the invading armies would be enormously simplified (...)

I question the very supposition that natural rights should be conjoined with legal rights, as I have recently brought up again below.  

The reasoning here seems to me to suggest that there is connection between the two (or at least to suggest in some way that there SHOULD or OUGHT to be a connection); this is a moral argument, not a legal one.  The POV is not neutral.  This question comes up in the very opening paragraph of SEP entry for legal rights, the issue: """"Whether legal rights are conceptually related to other types of rights, principally moral rights""""  [].  We need to talk about what is being inferred here by these two entries being together.

I understand where you are coming from. I have no actual proof that those are legitimate street names, but I have a case to argue. I feel that no citation should be needed for the addition of street names, and I say this because it varies. Street names vary from culture to culture, of which I am sure you are aware of. I feel that in order to provide the most accurate information about this topic there needs to be a diverse culture of editors. I hope that makes sense. Wikipedia is supposed to provide the most accurate information possible, and I am just trying to add to it. By adding certain slang names, it opens up people’s knowledge. Being a user myself, I feel that my information is VERY accurate, seeing as how I would use the terms on a daily basis. Sure there is no citation, but there is an addict that lived the lifestyle. That should be a citation enough. I hope you now understand where I am coming from.

Thanks,
 

I disagree.  If it is a used streetname, there simply are references for it.  I am sorry, but information is not accurate because the person that adds it says so, accuracy should be measured by reliable sources.  
That street names vary from culture to culture indeed is known, and I am not saying that we should not have streetnames in articles, they indeed are a welcome addition.  The thing is only, what if I am a vandal, and I want to add the streetname 'mobile' to the list of MDMA-streetnames (I could add a whole list of common objects that people carry around when being in the street, and I have seen that happening) .. from your point of view, you would not contest that.  Now seen the seriousness that you have in editing the article, and since you have taken the effort to open a wikipedia account, I don't think you are a vandal, but still the same principle would apply.

Whenever you see brackets that means that the editor has added an explanation.  In this case [organic remains] was added to explain the word 'they'.  While W&M; used the word fossil in the previous sentence it is clear that they were referring to organic remains because by definition, recently buried remains (such as what is """"now occurring"""") are not fossils.  From the """"Dictionary of Geologic Terms"""", 3rd edition, 1984, by Bates and Johnson:  FOSSIL:  Any remains, trace, or imprint of a plant or animal that has been preserved in the earth's crust since some past geologic or prehistoric time.  Nothing buried in the present can be a fossil, for it is in historic time.  And further, you do not quickly bury fossils to preserve them, you quickly bury organic remains to protected them long enough so they they can eventually become fossils in some future geologic era.

W&M; likely used the term fossil loosely, like many editors of this WP page, to refer to organic remains that might become fossils per definition in some geologic era in the future.  It is unfortunate that W&M; were not as precise as they might have been, because uninformed people, such as Talk.Origins, misunderstand and twist what they said.

As much impact as W&M; have had on Creationary thought, nearly all fellow creationist today recognize that The Genesis Flood, is now way out of date.

In sort tough: During the flag/CoA merges, with CoA articles it was the WS article that was merged into the SADR one, as the SADR article contained nearly all the significant edit history. It was given a WS title via a Technical move request. Someone (not going to unnecessarily publicize his name) has been trying to unilaterally re-split the articles, even tough he's the only one who thinks that should be done and everyone else who has an opinion thinks that there should be one article. He had the Technical move of the merged article undone, on the procedural baces that he objected to it, as a prelude to atemping to unilaterally split the article against conciseness. His split was undone by Dzlinker and myself, hence the poor title which doesn't match the scope.

response to your nasty personal attacks, Blockader and Blah
'You people are unbelievable in your ignorance and the ease to which you get brainwashed by subversive propaganda.
 Learn to read. I said that Paine and Jefferson came up with the ideas for a minarchist government whereby the freedom and equality of the people would  be protected. Have you read Paine and Jefferson? You are attacking the wrong men. If you want to rightfully attack an American forefather attack Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, and others.
 I never said they were anarchists. I do say, though that Jefferson expressed his admiration for anarchism. If he had suggested it at a congressional meeting he probably would have been shot or lynched or they just would have impeached him. (Something that many of them wanted to do anyway.)
 Being patriotic to your country and anarchism are not mutually exclusive. Sounds like you have been reading too much Communist propaganda. Communists just love to subvert governments and China is trying to subvert this one right now. I personally would love to overthrow the fascist-socialist state we're in right now and get back our freedom. But Maoism is not something I would have in mind in the way of freedom.
 Blah and Bockade, since you think you know the ideologies that are best for me, let me find one for you. Hmm, maybe subverting your current government into a dictatorshiptotalitarian state would be appropriate. Or perhaps, as you are incapable of reading comprehension or the most rudimentary thought, working in a convenience store, rather than editing what used to be an encyclopedia would be a good idea for you. Or maybe, how about going and fucking yourself.

Hi again Bo [will just use the abbreviation for speed],
Not much time at the moment since I'm in the midst of a project but wanted to respond to a few points.
First of all, thanks for your kind, even-toned replies to my questions and expressions of  irritation. I DO think that WikiP should have an avenue of complaint for users  from my recent experience, it seems contributors can get stuck in an endless loop of Admins (or whatever titles you and your editorial colleagues have), never reaching someone with the authority to resolve complaints. You and others have referred vaguely to the """"process"""" of Copyvio review, but I have no idea who does that, when they do it, or how to reach them to defend my position/claims.
1. I sometimes find a """"You have a message waiting"""" notice. How is that genrated? Do you get this same notice when I post on your User page? Is there a way to send a messaage directly to you so it won't be visible to the world  e.g. if I needed to provide you an email address or something I didn't want posted here?
2. Regarding Crapsey. I did indeed check various sources in writing the article. And if you read the EB citation and my piece, you'll see that mine is quite different, not at all a sentence-by-sentence paraphrase. It differs in style and wording from the outset to the end and contains far more detail than EB. Moreover, Crapsey is a local legend in Rochester, and I had no need to consult Brittanica  I don't know how you folks access EB, but I stopped using it years ago when they went from a free to a pay service that only provides """"teaser"""" articles that are virtually useless. Thus, the entry non-members get for Crapsey is the following truncated info:
http://www.britannica.com/eb/article?tocId=9125441
We have never been EB """"trial"""" members or subscribers; it would appear that you folks at WikiP do have some sort of membership, however. Is that correct?
3. Regarding Sock Puppetting, I was adapting your own WikiP term for those who use """"dummy"""" accounts (or have friends act in concert with them) to insure they get the posting they want. It was beginning to appear that your colleagues were teaming up in a Revert War. In fact, they did just that in another article we posted about area poet William Heyen  they kept Copyvio-ing it, though in fact it was written by us for our own journal, Exit Online. When I pointed this out, I was told, in effect, """"Oh yeah? Well, prove it!"""""""" I have no idea what sort of """"proof"""" one can offer for owning someone one has posted to their own web site (or any other web site for that matter). More to the point, THEY offered no suggestions as to how one might """"prove it."""" If you have an email address for someone at WikiP who oversees this sort of stuff, then let me know and we'll be happy to contact him/her.
4. As for """"my article,"""" I was referring to the fact that it's mine by virtue of the fact that I authored it. In fact, your own guidelines specifically state that the author of each edit is the author and has only granted a GFDL license, so that author can be said to be the owner of that particular edit. That could even be the whole article. For this reason, the authors don't have to comply with the GFDL requirements for their own writing - the GFDL license doesn't override their own rights to use their own work. They can also license it to any number of others under any other licenses they choose, since that's one of the rights authors have.
5. Thanks for your candor over concerns about EB suits over copyright. Maybe EB has folks that spend their days doing nothing but monitor WikiP, though I somehow doubt it since they would not have access to the same """"new posting"""" info that you and your colleagues use to monitor postings. It would take an army of staff even to randomly check WikiP listings.
6. As for creating an account, in fact, my colleagues and I do have accounts and would, indeed, like the """"credit"""" for our efforts. However, given the recent unpleasant incidents we've encountered that include threats of being blocked/blacklisted, I'm sure you can understand why anonymity seems preferable for the moment.
7. I'll have to check into templates. I suspected you might be using some sort of boilerplate, and this is precisely why using forms can be so dangerous.

 Hari and other parts with sources not cited 

To attribute quotes to Steyn or Hari without citing sources is against Wikipedia policy. You should reference with links (or due diligence references including where and date it was published, volume and page number) what quotes are attributed to Hari or Steyn. Erroneous quotes attributed to a person, not backed up by references, could be interpreted as libelous, and should be avoided. http://www.ifex.org/en/content/view/full/61063/
Large quotes attributed to Hari will be deleted as this is a post about Steyn, not about any single critic. 

The following was deleted:

According to Hari, in November 2001, Steyn circulated a series of conspiracy theories that a huge number of Muslims in New York City had been forwarned of the terror attacks. A Muslim student at a Brooklyn high school, he claims, said to his teacher on 6 September 2001: """"See those two buildings? They won't be standing there next week."""" 

On 10 September 2001, Steyn further claimed, """"a sixth-grade 
[NOTE: HOW COULD STEYN HAVE CLAIMED THIS ON 10 SEPT 2001? THIS STATEMENT MUST BE TOTALLY FALSE.]
student of Middle Eastern origin at a Jersey City school warned his teacher to stay away from Lower Manhattan because """"something bad was going to happen"""". Teachers at schools within sight of the World Trade Center in New York reported that, as the towers burned, many Muslim students were taking pictures: it seemed odd that so many of them happened to have brought their cameras to school on that particular day.""""

Hari commented: 

""""Almost no evidence has been offered in support of [this] claim. Steyn cites only the """"evidence"""" of a disgraced and sacked journalist on a suburban New York paper, and even that is for just one of several """"facts"""" that he cites. [...] Steyn seems to believe seriously that many American Muslims knew about the plan and did not warn anybody - not even the 300-plus Muslims who were murdered in the attack... """"

Steyn himself wrote:

In The River War (1899), Winston Churchill's account of the Sudanese campaign, there's a memorable passage which I reproduce here while I'm still able to: 
""""How dreadful are the curses which Mohammedanism lays on its votaries! Besides the fanatical frenzy, which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog, there is this fearful fatalistic apathy. Improvident habits, slovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish methods of commerce, and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the Prophet rule or live. A degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement; the next of its dignity and sanctity. The fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property - either as a child, a wife, or a concubine - must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased to be a great power among men.

""""Individual Moslems may show splendid qualities. Thousands become the brave and loyal soldiers of the Queen: all know how to die. But the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it. No stronger retrograde force exists in the world. Far from being moribund, Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytising faith. It has already spread throughout Central Africa, raising fearless warriors at every step; and were it not that Christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science - the science against which it had vainly struggled - the civilisation of modern Europe might fall, as fell the civilisation of ancient Rome.""""

Is that grossly offensive to Muslims? Almost certainly. Is it also a rather shrewd and pertinent analysis by one of Britain's most eminent leaders? I think so.""",0.0

 People know if they're happy or not. 
I take offense with the view of some members here that some countries are happier than they """"should be."""" 
To be honest, I see nothing wrong with a study that asks people whether they're happy or not, then compiles the results. If people in Colombia consider themselves happier than people in Russia, that's their decision. 
This index is not a matter of researchers deciding which countries are the happiest, then listing their opinions. It's the product of surveys of the citizens within those countries, if I read the page right.
Sure, you might wonder why the endangered, malnourished citizens of Colombia are happier than the well-educated, protected citizens of Russia. Nevertheless, it does little good to go up to a Colombian and say, """"you shouldn't be happy! Look at all these statistics on your country!"""" or approach a Russian and say, """"Well, based on your literacy and your income, shouldn't you be happier?"""" 
People might not know much, but they do know whether or not they're happy. With that in mind, I don't see any problems with a study that asks citizens if they're satisfied with life, then compares the responses across countries.

Hmmm, but the situation there (Madrid, and Spain in general...) is also not so good now. The unnemployment is huge! My favourite place in Spain is Benalmadena a costal town near Marbella where all the cool Spanish people use to go, because Marbella is too turistic, and Benalmadena was still undiscouvered by the """"people"""" or mass tourism. Another reason are the great golf courses that are near. P.S.:You said in your comment """"we are just a little bit richer"""", it can´t apply to Serbia, because it´s way much poorer than in the 80´s. Yugoslav Serbia was way better. There was freedom to travel (to Yugoslav citizens wasn´t even required visas for majority of western countries) and had, limited throu, private property or companies. We had the EURO in 1976, Olympic winter games in 1984, the non-alignement was a very interesting initiative... Younger people (even in Serbia too) doesn´t know much of that. Almost all Serb families had a house on the Adriatic, going skiing was usual, travelling to Austrian or Swiss Alps, to Italy or Spain in summer, was """"normal"""" to many Belgraders. I see you been to South Serbia (Niš and Leskovac), but you should have in mind that Belgrade and the northern part was and is way more richer (double, or even more). About the separatism, it was a huge error (for Serbia) not to allow to Croatia and Slovenia to be independent during the monarchic period. All the rest of the country was suposed to belong to Serbia (call me nationalist, but that is a fact). Even Yugoslavia was created so there wouldn´t be a """"big"""" orthodox Kingdom of Serbia. Neither Vatican, Austria, Germany or Turkey, neither France and UK (with excuse of the possibility of that Serbia becoming a allied of Russia) wanted that, so a """"neutral"""" Yugoslavia was imposed. About the Serbian-Bulgarian problem, it all begin when Serbia was not allowed to have direct access to see, so it had to be compensated with lands, part of current Macedonia, that were suposed to belong to Bulgaria. I know and recognise that. You have the maps on the page (Kingdom of Serbia) where you see that the Serbo-Bulgarian border was moved east, so that Albaian state was created. All current Eastern Macedonia was given to Serbia as compensation for taking Albania from Serbia. We could talk centuries about it, wright?   """,0.0

 You know, this has touched me. I was really wowed by the impartial way in which the other administrators handled this. Very fair and forgiving... That said, I'm taking the advice of  and posting here. I'm guessing he and Hiding will read it anyway. Mentoring? If you like. I don't think there will be any issues with my edits per se, as most would have a hard time proving they are detrimental as opposed to beneficial to the articles. Methodology is a different case, and here we get into the grey area of how Wiki guidelines are perceived - the source of so many arguments. No, I don't (heh) have a medical condition. Unfortunately, I have a lot of pride and particularly so in my hobbies, one of which is comics. Having a photographic memory and being able to pretty much cite off the top of my head character appearances does make me a tad arrogant. I have to work on that. As far as I know, I'm the only one that actually rewrites whole FCB's accurately, and while this is great for Wikipedia I sometimes forget that others may contribute in different and smaller ways, as these efforts are no less important.

Nightscream? I bear him no ill will. We'll have a chat on the relevant pages about style, but that can be worked out. I think he perhaps took the styles changes that  and I pushed for in Ultimates the wrong way, and seems to have """"followed"""" me ever since.

What would you do ? Xerox pages of a book I, unlike you, read 2 years ago ? And which proves-what ? That in Starčević's political career the term """"Slavosrb"""" was used exclusively for enemies (as he saw them) of Croatian independence ? The main """"Slavosrbs"""" were Strossmayer, Germans, Hapsburg monarchy, and the so-called """"Khuen Serbs""""- the Serbs living in Croatia and affilliated with the  hated political regime of oppression. How come that vast majority of political representatives of Serbs in Croatia, more than 98%, had been, during the most oppressive period in the 19th century,  collaborators of Khuen regime ? Truly-these Serbs (or Orthodox Vlachs who nationally """"awoke"""" as Serbs in mid- and 2nd half of the 19th century) had fully deserved the """"Slavosrbs"""" tag in Starčević's lingo-unlike the descendandts of Orthodox Vlachs who were Starčević's followers (Stjepan Miletić, August Harambašić, Dušan Kotur, Dušan Vlaisavljević, Milan Ogrizović,..). No one can rationally deny anyone's ethnic affiliation, this is certain. The fact that Starčević did this to the descendands of the Orthodox  Vlachs is not a sign of political wisdom, or even ordinary logic. But, it must be underscored that he reacted to the denial of Croatian ethnic affiliation promulgated by Vuk Karadžić's pan-Serbian ideology. And this must not be forgotten: who had begun with this game of denial ? Who wanted another people's extirpation ? Whose idenmtity was forged, among other things, upon cultural theft and misappropriations ? Who spoiled the well ? http://www.hic.hr/books/greatserbia/

 This image may be deleted.

Thanks for uploading Image:Wilno.PNG. The Wikimedia Foundation is very careful about the images included in Wikipedia because of copyright law. We need you to specify two things on the image description page:
 The copyright holder, and
 The copyright status

The copyright holder is usually the creator. If the creator was paid to make this image, then their employer may be the copyright holder. If several people collaborated, then there may be more than one copyright holder. If you created this image, then you are the copyright holder.

Because of the large number of images on Wikipedia, we've sorted them using image copyright tags. Just find the right tag corresponding to the copyright status of this image, and paste it onto the image description page like this: {{TAGHERE}}.  

There are 3 basic ways to licence an image on Wikipedia:

If you have the express permission of the copyright holder to licence their work under the above licence, use the image copyright tag: . The GNU Free Documentation License is another option. Again, if you have the express permission of the copyright holder, use the tag .

The copyright holder can also release their work into the public domain. See here for examples.

Images from certain sources are automatically released into the public domain. This is true for the United States, where the Wikimedia servers are located.

 I encourage you to read that essay carefully. WP is a great resource. It is an amazing resource. It is additionally useful, helpful, unprecedented, and perhaps even world changing! I love it, that's why I volunteer my time here to improve articles and direct people to resources that can help answer their questions. But none of that makes it reliable, not in WP's own terminology. The scientific theory article is a great example. That's actually a pretty good article. And it's useful for many purposes. But the definition is presented too simplistically, and it makes it seem that all theories are generally accepted as true explanations of the world, and that is not the case, as is demonstrated by the phlogiston theory. And that example is confusing, but there are also many many inaccuracies and outright incorrect statements on WP  I know because I've fixed a few. Some are accidental, some are malicious, some will be soon fixed, but others linger. Another thing to remember is WP is always a work in progress. A true scholar should evaluate the reliability of every source. That is why I keep directing you to the SEP. That article is written by highly esteemed professional philosophers of science, who we know are educated, trained, credentialed and accepted in that community. Likewise, textbooks are vetted by editors and publishers, and academic journal articles go through peer review to help ensure that correct information is presented. That is part of why they are WP:RS. In contrast, WP is the encyclopedia anyone can edit. I can assert to you that I'm a professional scientist, with over a hundred citations in peer-reviewed journals to my academic articles, and a PhD in math, and maybe that will help convince you that I know what I'm talking about. But I'm not going to bother to prove that to you, and you can't really be sure that I'm not making that stuff up ) While we attempt to distill our reliable sources into good articles, sometimes that gets messed up. If you read the entirety of the SEP article on scientific theory, you will see that it does not support the sentence which cites it in our article! I don't know how that happened. But it will just sit there wrong until someone notices and has the time and energy to fix it. And even then, some well-intentioned editors may resist the change, and revert. And maybe it's not even wrong. Maybe some RS do reserve """"theory"""" for widely accepted theories, and would instead say that we should rename the Phlogiston theory to """"the former Phlogiston theory"""" or something else! So then we'd have to do a whole re-write, explaining several different notions of what a scientific theory is, and then it might make the article less useful for the casual reader. 
For 99% of lay use, the issue of reliability may not matter. And surely using WP's sources to cite in papers is a great idea - but you have to make sure that you read and understand them yourself, and don't depend on what WP says they say. If my life depended on it, I would not trust anything on WP, unless somehow I had no other sources available at all, and hence no choice. So no, WP is not reliable. But that doesn't mean it isn't great. Cheers,    """,0.0

 Oregon Vortex 

 Hello Queen Cake!  Your comments to me about the """"veracity"""" and the """"worthiness"""" of my edit to the article on the Oregon Vortex were nothing short of rude.  Have you been there?  Do you believe an eye witness is less reliable than someone with a Ph.D., or less who has NEVER been there?  Someone who has never been in the energy and has had the oppotunity to experience all the things that the article derides?  That """"optical illusion"""" that occurs with two people does not happen in a controlled environment.  It takes place in the great outdoors.  And I have also seen the golf balls, and many, many other things.  I now see that Wikipedia is nothing more than a forum for frustrated editors and writers who have never sold anything worthwhile and this is their last claim to fame, and they're going to go for it for all it's worth, regardless of whether they distort the truth or not.  Getting your name out there is what's MOST important.  What arrogance!!!  You don't even live in the US, let alone Oregon!  I have been to the vortex many, many times, and I will swear on a warehouse of Bibles that all the phenomena is just that:  PHENOMENA.  And by the way, my """"name"""" on this joke of a enclyclopedia is Ms Medium.

I don't think I'm the one most in need of a lecture about not seeing the forest for the trees.

Look, Duk, if you want to take on the job of my reeducation, I can probably talk to you about it.  

But if you want to do so, first we need a solid foundation on which to build the discussions.  Let's stick to what is known about why I was blocked, okay?
JzG blocked me because I complained, in a point incidental to a separate complaint, on a complaints noticeboard, that Rlevse was rude and inconsiderate in his actions towards me.  We know that because JzG came right here and said that was why he was blocking me.
Rlevse blocked me because I had not responded on Wikipedia:Wikiquette alerts.  We know that because he came right here and said that was why he was blocking me.
We also know it because Rlevse went to WQA and said that was why he was blocking me.
Rlevse did not go and make any such explanation at Wikipedia talk:Call a spade a spade.
Rlevse did not go and make any such explanation at User talk:ArielGold

Now, maybe I just missed it, but I don't think there is anything at Wikipedia:Blocking policy saying that the decision to block is something entirely at the administrator's whim, or that the administrator should
Block now.  You can always invent a reason for it later.
or anything along those lines.  So let's just stick with what is actually known and knowable about he reason for which I was blocked, the things that had been documented and recorded in our various histories here at Wikipedia before I was blocked.  Anything else is irrelevant.

Don't invent new reasons for a block.  At the same time, don't say that the stated reasons for a block were not the reasons for it.

For that matter, if Rlevse had wanted to take on that job, and had felt that there was something he wanted to teach me, he likewise could have tried to talk to me.  He did not do so.  If JzG had wanted to take on that job, he likewise could have tried to talk to me.  But he took it one step further than Rlevse did; JzG did make a comment addressed to something I said, but then he blocked me to prevent me from responding to his own comment.   22:13",0.0
"Questions 

I believe that I've understood and correctly used/explained most of the historical Indian terms used in this article, but;

1. What is Mughal Sardari?

From the context I would guess its a position (general?) in the Mughal army.

2. What is the correct spelling of Shayeste Khan?

There seems to be inconsistency on how this name is rendered in English characters. I also found Shaista Khan in Shivaji .

3. Could someone confirm that Killedar means a garrison commander?

Or if it doesn't correct it.

4. I assume (from context) that Durga also means fort or maybe  a fortified town. 

Is that correct? But see current article Durga .

5. We're missing article for Sangram Durga, or maybe we're missing an article for Sangram and an expansion of  Durga 

6. Finally just general help with standardising the spelling and capitalisation of the historical terms and names  (and titles) would be very helpful!

"Wikipedia's Double Standards and Failure to follow their own written policies

Wikipedia (it's editors and administrators) uses double standards and does not follow their own written polices as they have wrongly and recklessly deleted the following addition to Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl wikipedia article. 

 Independent film maker Royce Mathew had sued the Walt Disney Company, Jerry Bruckheimer Inc./films, Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio in Federal Court in regards to the Pirates of the Caribbean movie.  Detailed in the lawsuits www.disneylawsuit.com  filed in Federal court “PUBLIC RECORD” (2005 & 2006), and in various national and international news and press releases, state that in the early 1990's independent film maker Royce Mathew had pitched his original supernatural pirate story to the Walt Disney Company which is about “cursed pirates” of the Black Pearl pirate ship; pirates who don't want anything to do with the plunder/return a treasure because they are cursed, with effects of the curse they endure is fully revealed by moonlight and the gold medallion on a gold chain with mystic properties able to summon/call.  Royce Mathew had made a short derivative video work in 1994.  Royce Mathew’s credits included projects for Paramount Pictures, Allan Carr, David DeCoteau and Charles Band and his Full Moon Entertainment company.

Then years later, as the lawsuit details, via Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, the Walt Disney Company, had incorporated various homages from their Pirates of the Caribbean theme park ride attraction into Royce Mathew’s supernatural pirate story, and are selling it as Walt Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl movie franchise.   The Walt Disney Company states that Royce Mathew’s claims and lawsuits have no merit.  

During legal proceedings,  the Walt Disney Company, Jerry Bruckheimer (films/Inc.), Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio “The Defendants” were all represented by the same team of attorneys headed by Sanford “Sandy” Litvack, who is a close associate of the Walt Disney Company (Michael Eisner), who also was the Walt Disney Company’s attorney in the noted lawsuit of Jeffrey Katzenberg vs the Walt Disney Company.",0.0

The Herbert Birch Kingston Story of the origins of Sweetest Day is a verisimilitude, meaning it is very similar to the truth but not the exact truth at all. In fact, the dissemination of this story by Hallmark, American Greetings, Retail Confectioners International and countless other promoters of Sweetest Day is a form of mass deception and market manipulation. It has been going on for 85 years and has resulted in billions of dollars in revenues for these companies. But at what cost? America pays the cost of Sweetest Day in credibility, a trend which must be reversed if we are ever to win the hearts and minds of the world again.

So his task was clear to us. Since he is the point man, the go-to guy. It's very easy to get information from him. He has the two """"tool"""" talk pages, his newsletters and holds """"office hours on IRC chat. And email, plus he responds readily and to the point on his talk page. There's no confusion. Everyone knows what's going on. If he can't give a direct answer, he might say something like """"I have no control over that; I'll ask the developers if your proposal is possible and get back to you."""" He is really clear about what he can do and what is out of his hands (up to the developers or WMF or technically not feasible etc.). 
I appreciate that you and Ldavis (WMF) are community liaison people, but I only learned about you recently and I'm not sure what sorts of things you cover or what it would be appropriate to contact  you or Ldavis (WMF) about. I found out accidentally about Dennis (WMF) – or what ever his name is – because I got involved with copyvio issues and I knew Moonriddengirl handled that kind of stuff, etc. That's the first I learned of {WMF) editors around.
My big beef (which I've gotten over) was a problem with an Online Ambassador. And I kept being told, every time I asked that """"it was being handled"""" by the Steering Committee. There was zero transparency, and I even had a post removed and got very bad vibs for asking questions from some of editors (I don't know what, if any,  positions they held in  the Education Program). So I am very surprised (and relieved) to read above: """"The Steering Committee in its most recent form wasn't responsible for overseeing anything except the online ambassador management and recruitment; as a result, the current status of online ambassador recruitment and management is largely unknown.""""  
So I welcome Pine's transparency and your acknowledgment (from my point of view) of reality, and I hope that this all works out.

"You got what had been coming to you. I hope that being a k3wL eleet nerd-o-pedia moderator has made your life hell.

- From someone that you totally wronged with your bullshit and managed to get me to stop contributing very significant contributions to this site nearly a year ago now. (And I contributed a LOT in a short time and would have contributed SO much more had I continued. Things that I did: huge amounts of professional class photography given away for free (placed PD) on subjects (often providing the only pics, to this day, on the subjects in question), hundreds of pages formatted according to standards, huge amounts of latest subject matter information added and facts corrected (in some cases so new that this was the first place on the net to have it) etc. etc.) - and instead of helping me and being civil, sensible and using common sense YOU were more interested in defending a non-contributing user who (for no apparent reason) started a campaign of open violent threats, death threats, spamming and vandalism on me. You were having too much fun abusing your moderator privileges by placing temporary blocks on me, trying to stop me from making my point and trying to give this hugely offensive other user a chance to avoid a police investigation, by mod-vandalizing discussions on the subject etc. - against most other moderators (private) views even - they had the sense not to start a mod war on the subject. Your 500 page nerd-o-pedia rule-book and abusing it to the point of idiocy was more interesting to you. Apparently you felt that since you had read it, everyone else should waste at least as much time and read it too down to every last letter, or you were gonna use it against all common sense toward anyone who didn't - with no regard for the actual situation and reasons behind it, no regard for that individuals contributions, no regard for civility - and most of all, with no common sense applied whatsoever.

It's indeed too bad that most pages on nerd-o-pedia are starting to be shockingy un-maintained and obsolete, indeed dead now that the initial rush of contributors is over after a few years, and the fun is over for most people - as, the most brutal blow of all, moderators such as YOU have managed to destroy the morale of even the most serious contributors and have had them leave. They simply did not wish to spend too much time arguing or alternatively face putting up with arrogant admin behavior, because it always will start to take more of your time than contributions here, because of people like YOU, and how wrong the principles are how admins are selected here. It's all about brown-nosing with the crowd and building your giant online virtual ego and lick the ass of other even more OCD nerds who are already admins, and you're just a wannabe. 

Good ****ing luck trying to get anything edited or updated here in a year or two besides top 10 whatever pop bands may be popular at the time, the latest tv show pages and some other obsessive-compulsive nerdishm. Nobody is foolish enough to put up with the crap that comes along with the job, from people such as YOU.

For example, the pages on my subjects were very active till late 2006, and since that they have... well. Remained in the same form as the core contributors left them, as they left this site. No updates. I'm truly not the only one to eject. Not worth the effort to contribute when all you get is shitted all over, if you ever need any help.

It's kind of funny that an admin can burn out of this site too, but given your attitude back then, I'm not surprised you did. After all, there were some decent admins here back then (such as  ), and I'm sure there's a few now, but WAY too many nerds for whom it is the biggest thing of their lives, and they have to show it, and snoop their noses everywhere. But like I said, as even admins are dropping out, what do you think happened to the contributors? Many pages now are actually full of incorrect shit, because no people of expertise hang around any more to correct details, and newbies or worse, malicious trollers slowly degrade the content that once was at least somehow accurate and relevant. Admins will be happy to see updates to the page, but the fact is, most of the updates today are degenerating the pages, obfuscating subjects and adding factual errors and garbage.

And too bad you didn't quit a year ago, I might still be here, and there would probably be several thousands of lines, and few hundred articles more, along with maybe ~1000 more photographs.

 YOU ARE BLOCKED IN LIFE FOREVER AND FOR LIFE INDEFINITELY, YOU TRASHY DUSTBIN 

YOU ARE A TRASHY DUSTBIN WHO IS BLOCKED IN LIFE AND FOR LIFE INDEFINITELY
 
It can be so obviously seen that you have no life in reality and hence you carry on with editing pages on Wikipedia,which is another big joke, like you. In fact, it is jokers like you that make Wikipedia an unreliable piece of crap that the world laughs on. You thought you can block users who edit articles that are wrongly written to project a """"good"""" image like that C-grade item song sleaze actress Payal Rohatgi. On the account of hello5678, when I edited to write the truth, since I work with the media and knew the actual truth, you did what you knew best - to block accounts and even have the foolish audacity to write that it did not seem I was a journalist. Your block anyways went futile ( like all your remaining blocks on other users go, and future blocks will be going ) since as I had said, there are a million computers to comment and reply from. It just depends on my wish if I want to respond to idle losers like you and whether I have the time to do so. Once and for all, I am doing it this time, and won't remove time for worthless people like you again.
 
You had some advice on how I should spend my """"blocked time"""" by reading WP:Dispute pages on Wikipedia so that I have better ideas on dealing with disputes. Actually ,you need better ideas to deal with life. I am not foolish like you to spend any amount of my time bothering about rubbish written by stupid people like you who have no work in real life and spend days editing pages on Wikipedia/ Scribblebook that no one bothers to read. Some people are just unfortunate like you and 2over0. And if you are troubled by my calling that actress """"sleazy"""", then that's your problem. Cos that's the only work she has done and the press uses precisely that term while referencing her work. You also spoke about writing """"accurate"""" information on wikipedia. Ironic, when you don't even bother finding out what is accurate, and spend endless hours blocking, and acting admin as if it is an important position in your life. Oh wait, that may be the only position you probably have or will have ever in your unfortunate life.
 
Carry on with your scribble game. And if you feel threatened by media exposure, then that shows you knew you were wrong. It's only when people are wrong that they feel threatened. Pity your personality. Also, you ended by writing that """" it's clear you aren't a journalist, and have no means of carrying out your threat """" - LOL. Sad, that you lived in that illusion. For JOKERS like you who are totally idle,and who scribble away in virtual pages on Wiki-scribble-pedia, will obviously withdraw from the truth. You yourself have no idea at all if I am a journalist, and you write that it's clear that I am not. Well, you are also inane and a clown to fool yourself. I had all means, and the said article has already been published. I had NO TIME to let you know, since I am a busy person, unlike you and do not find time to come scribble on virtual pages that clowns like you , 2OVERO, 2/0, AKERANS, MANAGERARC, FISHERQUEEN (yeah, we named you again - Suck it up),  KURU etc. do all your life. You will find that information, depending on which Godforsaken part of the world you live in.  And like last time, you can go ahead and block me this time too. For , no one cares two hoots for your silly blocking games. We do have a life, unlike losers like you. Maybe its time for you to go fish in real life, so that you can come anywhere remotely close to having a life - LOL.

SO, LOSERQUEEN, GROW UP and GET A LIFE, You IDLE CLOWN OR ELSE, YOU WILL REMAIN A LOSER ALL YOUR LIFE. WHO CARES ANYWAY WHAT INANE, PUERILE LOSERS LIKE YOU DO IN THEIR LIVES. Cos all you know best is to play edit and block games on your scribblebook called wikipedia. Scribble on cos anyway no one cares and I most certainly don't. Time for you to go fishing then, LOSERQUEEN. And I wont bother to check any replies or anything else ever, cos I dont have time unlike Idle LOSERS like you, Loserqueen.

"This is for the user small bones. There is no documentation for any other spokesman for irom Sharmila apart from me. That's just original research from your wiki colleagues. 
This is an analysis by Medha Patkar which points out that unconditional release will result only in Sharmila's death. She points out that the call for unconditional release is just another form of brutal treatment but you can read the article yourself http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/government-brutally-dealing-with-irom-sharmila-medha-patkar_1462222.html
This is the Indian Express report which points out that she has no real supporters in Manipur Mr Babloo Loitongbam controls many fake NGOs in Manipur and is doing what he can to isolate her http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/irom-sharmila-released-again-refuses-to-go-with-her-supporters-and-breaks-down/99/
This is a reference to the Indian Intelligence Bureau and RAW about Manipuri NGOs working as foreign industrial spies http://www.newindianexpress.com/thesundaystandard/NGOs-Foreign-Funds-Fuel-Terror/2014/06/22/article2292852.ece
The original leaked report doesn't have the names of the NGOs or the names of the foreign spies but Mr Babloo Loitongbam outed himself and other Manipuris in this press release http://e-pao.net/GP.asp?src=2..260614.jun14
This is a report in Sharmila's own words voice and video of the abuses she has been facing including http://www.ndtv.com/video/player/left-right-centre/irom-sharmila-on-if-her-iconic-fast-has-been-hijacked/297129

Those are a few to be going on with. There are three trials in total. You don't require original research to work that out. She is being held in Imphal on judicial warrants if there weren't any trials in Imphal then she wouldn't be in prison. The last dates of the trial in Delhi are correct 11 & 12 August 2015 but it is nonsense to claim that there are no trials in Imphal or that it is impossible to find any reference to them. If in doubt use Google. 

The SS group has no standing with Sharmila but is also run by Mr Babloo Loitongbam. He comes from a very powerful police family and people suck up to him. If he drops the plans to have sharmila killed then you can campaign for him to get the nobel peace prize. I have no vendetta against anyone.

""""African descent""""?
If a model's race must be stipulated (although I don't see why it should be, since black plus-size models do very well in the industry, and are not particularly seen less often than Caucasian plus-size models), wouldn't it be better to say that a model is """"black"""" rather than """"of African descent""""? A good faith suggestion.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 24.215.23.237   

 It is relevant to denote her race in terms of the cosmetics work with Cover Girl; I strongly disagree that black models are 'not particularly seen less often than caucasian models' in this style of model work or any other, especially in an international context.  Although they may do 'as well' relatively, the amount of work is markedly less than that for caucasian models outside of the U.S.  Tesfay was born in Canada of Eritrean descent so the common descriptor """"African American"""" is erroneous.  To make it simple, 'black' it is.   

Link Spam
Not sure where to look on Wiki for the answer to this, so I'll ask here: when does a web link become web spam?  When the link breaks, or merely when someone notices that links have been added to an article?  For an article needing to find more sources, recent removals of all weblinks seems a bit overzealous to me.   

CALENDARS
The whole calendar paragraph is problematic now, I think; too big for the article relative to its significance. It's not possible to rank these along with ANTM, print magazines, etc., any more than online magazines, because they don't have anything like the same kind of public reach, and the naming of specific calendars in the first place invites spam. Since 2007, the year of the named calendars, is (nearly) over, and they haven't become annual publications, I think the paragraph should be cut back to refer to the launch of several calendars in general, without naming specifics, otherwise there's the impossible requirement of defining exactly what is or is not a notable calendar.  Also, the sentence about fostering a healthier industry attitude is too generic and applies to many projects involving plus-size models, not just these calendars. You'd need to repeat the same sentence in nearly every item in the article if it appears here. I recommend something like, """"2007 was the launch year for several grassroots calendar projects featuring women over a U.S. size 12, spurring similar projects in the following year.""""
Perhaps to be named, a calendar would have to merit its own Wiki entry, and undergo an AfD discussion.   
 I do not understand why you are trying to compare TV shows with consumer products and it is disingenuous of you to want to.  MODE no longer exists, should that be expunged from the article too?  I agree to a certain point about modifying the mention of calendars, however there are good media references available for the Fenomenal Calendar and this article sorely needs every good source link it can get.  The originators of a market niche are worth noting IMO; the rest are just jumping on the bandwagon (in terms of seeking self-promotion, not in production quality or financial returns) and certainly none of them yet are at the aesthetic level of Fenomenal, no matter what opinion one may hold on the theme of the styling, size of the models, or comparisons between unrelated other print products, such as MODE Magazine for example.  Further, I do not believe it necessary for a single mention to undergo AfD or else every model named to their own paragraph on this article should do the same.  I would think that a Fenomenal weblink is appropriate because the homepage remains visible online.  This calendar does set the standard for commercially-available calendar products; in the absence of Elena Miro's calendar remaining online for people to see, which in any case was never available for purchase and should only be considered a promotional item - anything other in comparison is apples and turnips.

 Suggestion: """"2007 was the launch year for several [link=http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/homegrown homegrown] calendar projects featuring women over a U.S. size 12, including the well-received (media reflink) Fenomenal Calendar (weblink).  These calendars have opened up a new market for the models to be seen outside of clothing advertising-only contexts, and also enabled them to capture the interest of people outside of the usual plus-size clothing consumer demographic.NEWL",0.0

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Wikipedia does not have a user page with this exact title. In general, this page should be created and edited by User:59.180.173.138.

Nonetheless, it is good to see such fictitious people emerging and these new 'entities' are probably one among the scores of sock-puppets being used for manipulation on wikipedia.  

It is of course pointed out that I have not made any personal attacks but pointed out not just glaring contradictions and discrepancies but also but steadfast refusal of such 'contributors' to realize these points and make corrective action.

I have posted in detail above about my contributions on the Chola dynasty and explanations and justifications for such postings along with not just the sources but also the quality of such sources and information.

I am indeed waiting for detailed discussions in case required. Unless that is done, any deletion of my contributions without assigning reasons is also as improper, as per established Wikipedia norms, as posting or making additions to an article without giving sources and references.

I am sure a neutral admin like Taprobanus and other contributors from the Tamil Nadu group will certainly reason in my trying to better the quality of the article on Chola Dynasty.  

Through the medium of this post, I also request the admins to initiate a debate on the origins of the so-called 'Chalukya Chola dynasty' which according to me never existed... (all the inscriptions right from Kulothunga I to the last Chola king Rajendra III) bear evidence to the fact that these kings either directly or indirectly, NEVER addressed themselves as Chola Chalukya or Chalukya Chola.  It is again the handiwork of manipulators who seek to maintain and continue the title Chalukya Chola.  By the same token kings after Vikramaditya VI in the Chalukya page should be called Chola Chalukya because that king was a son in law of Virarajendra Chola.. and Hoysalas after Veera Ballala II starting with his son Veera Narasimha should be called Hoysala Chola or Chola Hoysala because Ballala II was a son in law of Chola king Kulothunga III.

{{unblock|reason=Block serves no purpose. Given that my so-called PAs were limited to AN/I, and that I am preparing a case for RfC/U then I am hardly likely to persist. Further to the point that remarks on AN/I that are not related to content disputes are not disruptive, and therefore the block is not preventative, as there are, and have been, no concerns regarding disruption or vandalise to encyclopedic articles. My argument stands that this block is a WP:COATRACK with my """"personal attacks"""" being highlighted to mask the uncivil remarks and assertions on AN/I. Those assertions, based on undue lack of AGF, over my response to a WQA are based on straw man arguments, with no evidence to support the claims, and in fact run on a parallel track to the discussion at AN/I, but have in fact been misrepresented through synthesis to create an attack on my contribs, and cannot be reasonably analysed as a """"bad faith"""" WQA response. However, this is the tone that has been used by an admin who refused to get involved in the WQA, but did not hesitate to question my ability to respond to the WQA, which was also, notably, my first WQA response, which was concluded and closed by supporting editors. Therefore the attack on my response, which was made prematurely, perhaps an uncivil approach in itself, was unfounded. Since the close, the admin has refused to recognise their critique as a bad faith attack, nor have they refactored it recognise the conclusion of the WQA. They have, instead, used my earlier uncivil remarks, which I should not pre-dated the AN/I topic by 3 days and therefore the admins right to question my WQA response was somewhat presumptious given that the two events are unrelated, and casting doubts on an editors ability to contribute to X-area of wiki because they had a dispute in Y-area of wiki is not a logical conclusion, it is a straw man argument; i.e. """"Because MB was uncivil to editor-A on AN/I, he should be kept away from WQA"""". This flaw being, that every article, user, project and content page on wiki has a discussion page, therefore why not argue """"If MB is uncivil on AN/I, he could be uncivil anywhere""""? Having dismissed the admins argument as flawed, based in this discrepancy, plus the fact they were assuming I would respond to WQA, but it had been my first and there is no evidence to suggest I was going to make a career out of it, the admin drew conclusion based on a false premis. Those conclusions were used detrimentally and matter-of-fact, despite being opinions, theories and at most, concerns. At no time did the admin attempt to address those concerns on my talk page, as would be proper. Instead they made uncivil remarks, questioning the faith of my response and promoting a damning claim, using quotes out of context and lacking correct interpretation. I maintain that the intentions of the admin were uncivil, and that by addressing me """"potentially uncivil"""" the admin was making proactive disdainful remarks, based on one solitary WQA, rather than a reactive proposal based on sufficient history, behaviour patterns or evidence to support the theory. To make matters worse, when I confronted the admin with this they adopted a defensive stance, dismissing my anger at their assertions as uncivil, and convoluted the matter further by placing my angry response above their own behaviour, whilst casting judgement, thus clouding the issue, i.e. the WP:COATRACK counter-measure. I consider this an attack on my integrity, as my response to WQA was rejected and questioned before it was even resolved, which is a clear example of attacking the faith of an editor. Because the admin continued to accelerate their case against me with condescending remarks, and refusal to accept their straw man claim as unreasonable or irrelevant to the discussion, i.e. a fork. Their persistence to use those comments can only be observed as advocating. For any admin of that experience to be unable to recognise their own bad faith, illogical attempt to predict an editor, and close-minded approach, there has to be a underlying motive, in my belief, for them to persist, to the degree of blocking me and refusing to allow their behaviour to be questioned is paramount to enacting COI.  So, though my responses may be considered uncivil, they are in reaction to what I perceive as irresponsible admin attitude, and pessimistic misuse of my response at WQA. That is not a PA, or uncivil, it is a legit observation with regards my POV which was made to look warped due to the late-interjection with straw man based propositions, casting aspersions on my ability to handle WQA. Unless there has been a direct complaint or issue pertaining to a page, or discussion, it is not appropriate for an admin to imply anything, and therefore my one-off role at WQA is",0.0

Past Operational Deployments directed by COMUKMARFOR

Commodore Cunningham, the previous COMUKCSG, flew his flag throughout the January to May Orion '08 deployment, as Commander Task Group 328.01,[13] which included exercises with the Indian Navy, aboard HMS Illustrious.

The Naval Task Group for Operation VELA, a three month deployment to West Africa in 2006, was under the command of Commander UK Amphibious Group, Commodore Phil Jones. The VELA deployment involved a significant number of Royal Navy and Royal Fleet Auxiliary ships, the Royal Marine Commandos and helicopters.[14] The Task Group included HMS Albion, HMS Ocean, HMS Southampton, HMS Argyll, RFA Wave Knight, RFA Mounts Bay, RFA Sir Bedivere, RFA Fort Austin, HMS Enterprise, RFA Diligence, RFA Oakleaf, Mine Counter Measure Squadron 1 and a Fleet submarine together with the Fleet Lead Commando Group, consisting of 40 Commando Royal Marines, 59 Commando Independent Engineering Squadron, 29 Commando Royal Artillery and 539 Assault Squadron Royal Marines. Also involved were elements of Fleet Diving Unit 2 and 849 (B) Flight from RNAS Culdrose. Embarked in HMS Ocean for the deployment a Tailored Air Group (TAG) was formed, consisting of Sea King helicopters of 845 Naval Air Squadron, 846 Naval Air Squadron, Merlin Mk 1 aircraft from 820 Naval Air Squadron and Lynx helicopters of 847 Naval Air Squadron. The Vela task group conducted an amphibious exercise, Exercise Green Eagle, in Sierra Leone.

Task Groups despatched to the Far East since 2003 have included deployments in 2003, 2004, and 2005. In 2003, Naval Task Group 03 had been intended to take part in FPDA exercises in the Asia-Pacific region but was diverted for involvement in the 2003 Iraq War. Eventually part of the Naval Task Group including Liverpool, Marlborough and RFA Grey Rover departed Gulf waters, after the intervention phase of the Iraq War (2003), en route for Exercise Flying Fish, with Commonwealth-partners and members of the Five Power Defence Arrangements which are the United Kingdom, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand. In 2004, Exeter, Echo, RFA Diligence and RFA Grey Rover visited the Asia-Pacific region. In 2005, Liverpool, with RFA Grey Rover, made such a deployment.

You seem to be forgetting the dozens of massacres committed against jews by palestinian arabs during the time that the British had control of palestine, from the early 19th century all the way up to the arab-israeli civil war. It is amazing that you anti-zionists can ever claim that 1: arabs were there first (lie: jews can be traced in the land back to 2000 B.C, with a civilization established around 1100 B.C, palestinians are just arabs who were dropped off by invading muslims in the mid 7th century A.D. Thats about 2500 years after the jews) and that the jews started killing palestinians for no reason (lie: during the civil war the massacres committed by jews were a response to both recent and continuing decades of violence and racism against jews. while Irgun and others who committed massacres were terrorists and shouldnt have killed civilians, they were provoked many times over by arabs.)

"I'm going to be honest with you, I'm not going to pass your articles as GA, because frankly, they suck. But that doesn't mean an agreement can't be reached upon where your articles could still potentially reach GA.

First thing you need to know, is that Good Article status is a crock of shit. The criteria for it is a fair model, and it is not the problem. The problem is that it is not governed by a committee. Any bozo, like yourself, is allowed to review an article and ultimately decide if the article, in their mind, merits inclusion into CGD (Club Green Dot). The bar sits firmly in the mud. Snakes slither across it. My articles, on the other hand, never have enjoyed the benefits of exception. With extreme prejudice, they have been held to the highest possible standard set by the criteria.

Now we get to your GA review of Howling Bells, which I would like a full explanation for. That's one of the agreements that I have set forth, in order for you to avoid failure of your articles, by me. You can decide if you would like to abide by this resolution or not. Tell me something, are you on drugs, prescription or otherwise? If that offends you I apologize, but your review made me think of three things. Either somebody took a shit on your face and you couldn't see through it, you had a big D in your ass, or you were in a state of incoherence brought on by substance abuse. I must confess, I'm ashamed that I'm even having to talk to some punk ass high school kid who listens to crappy music. Not that I feel that I hold a higher place in this world than you, because Lord knows that's not the case. It's just that, I'm sittin' here having to deal with some goddamn little kid over the computer. Even at your age, I know you understand where I'm coming from.

There's not much of a reward getting an article to GA status, aside from that dot. A small part of me would like to see the article at GA, but it really doesn't concern me a whole lot whether it gets there or not. Howling Bells is at GA and that's basically good enough for me. As far as Halfway Gone goes, at this point, it's outta my hands. You're just gonna have to accept the fact the article could possibly be de-listed. Consider that your penalty for fuckin' around with other people's hard work.

Ok, so there are two agreements I have come up with that I think are very acceptable.

A full explanation of your GA review of Howling Bells (album). I'll guide you through it on the review page. If you decide to play ball, good on ya.
You must say the following to me, here on my talk page: I, , am just a punk ass teenager, who loves Justin Beiber, loves the crappy music of Justin Beiber, and loves crappy music from many other crappy artists.
The font has to be huge too, none of this small crap. Also, see if you can do it in some kind of color, that would be cool.

Now, I will not pass your articles if you agree to this, but I will not fail them. Instead, I will explain on the review pages that any reviewing of the articles that I have done up until this point should be disregarded. My reasoning will be because of my inexperience as a first time reviewer has led me to realize that I am not capable for such a task. I will wash my hands of the articles, take them off hold, and request that another editor undertake the review. If you are unwilling to accept these agreements, than you leave me no other choice but to expeditiously fail the articles. Let me know what you wanna do kid.  (meow)",0.14285714285714285

Instead, you choose to act like a self-appointed wikipedia police, running about throwing up the blue flags of WP rules and being a generally obnoxious person with no real use. Instead of actually contributing useful original edits to articles you seem to think this is the old Newpedia where people are expected to submit edits for your approval. If too many others take the same tac WP will collapse into dross. You violate every rule in the book of which you accuse others. You are a mean spirited, very angry person that drives away editors with your sarcastic responses and general high-handed behavior. I suspect you have no real special knowledge of any of the articles upon which you squat like a vulture waiting tear apart others creative edits. You really need to crack a book and study up on a subject or two and find an article you feel needs rewriting and to straighten out the too turgid, redundant writing that exists here on WP. Stop trying to act like you are an administrator and grow up.

At a time when WP needs more editors, particularly female, you with your coarse, rude behavior is the last thing WP needs. You are, to summarize it, a net negative.

 Diminishing returns from recycling? 

I propose that Steven Landsburg's arguments be either removed or shown to be refuted by the below logic. I personally think that the argument below, no matter how logical, would be too large to include. Similarly, Landsburg's arguments are provably illogical, and should not be included.

""""Economist Steven Landsburg has claimed that paper recycling actually reduces tree populations. He argues that because paper companies have incentives to replenish the forests they own, large demands for paper lead to large forests. Conversely, reduced demand for paper leads to fewer """"farmed"""" forests.[34] Similar arguments were expressed in a 1995 article for The Free Market.[35]""""

If the variable of incentive to plant new trees is taken to be proportionate to the number of trees required for paper, as this scenario suggests, then the only way that the scenario is true is if it not only assumes that the paper companies are planting fewer trees than they cut, but that more trees are cut down than exist. 

The simplest refutation of the scenario is the model where lumber companies plant as many trees as they cut down. In this case, the number of trees not cut down, due to less paper being required, is immaterial, as the lumber companies would simply plant a number equal to what had been cut. In addition, more old trees would stand.

However, let us pursue the other, and in my opinion more likely, scenario. Companies cut down more trees than they plant. For the sake of simplicity, consider this hypothetical starting state. Forestry companies cut down half existing trees, and replant half of the difference between what stood and and what has been felled, or 25%, for a total of 75% of the original number, if not the original quality, the new trees being young growth. Let us say recycled paper amounts to one half of the trees cut, 12.5%, which would bring the total in terms of usable resource to 87.5%. If it were not added, the next cycle would see the 75% cut, literally, in half, for 37.5%; half is replanted, for a total of 56.25%. If it were added, the 87.5% would be halved to 43.75%, and the company replanting half of that would make a total of 65.625%, almost 10% more trees.

It does not matter whether the companies plant as many as were cut, if they are induced by the remaining forest amount, or a percentage, or induced by the paper supply, or a percentage; it always ends up with less forest cut down. If Landsburg is a notable economist, it speaks ill of economists; he has not exhibited logical reasoning or the capacity o",0.0

As I wrote in the edit summary in response to one of your past edits, """"you'll need a WP:RS from a reliable third party (newspaper, etc) for this (court papers and Youtube are insufficient)).""""  One more time: court papers (without comment provided by some third party like a newspaper) and Youtube video are insufficient to include this material. Your obvious conflict of interest, use of Wikipedia articles to promote yourself and your agenda, and insistence on writing about yourself in Wikipedia articles is also noted.   

 Please see my comments at Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons/Noticeboard#Joel_Osteen. Beyond this,  along with everything else. Please stop now, Adamkey.   

 Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest/Noticeboard#Adamkey.   

I've read and reread the WP:RS which you continually cite as requiring a third party that is not a federal court's recognition of fact. I find no such requirement of a newspaper. The filing referenced was filed by Regent University, not by me, so there's your third party independently commenting on it. Moreover, the fact that a federal court recognized this as being fact is a second third party. Please demonstrate how Regent University and the federal courts(Southern District of Texas, East District of Virginia) do not meet standards of WP:RS.

WP:COI does not exist as I am using the talk page as requested by the policy.

WP:SOAP is not violated either. """"Propaganda, advocacy, or recruitment of any kind, commercial, political, religious, or otherwise. Of course, an article can report objectively about such things, as long as an attempt is made to describe the topic from a neutral point of view."""" Even if you view what I did outside Osteen's church as self promoting, it is reported in an objective manner. Further, this account is not the original author of the update.

This is not in any way WP:OR either. The events referenced are recorded in third party published sources and the references are not unique to Wikipedia.

Again, I ask that you cite the specific portions of policies you believe this post to violate, as citing them generally seems to be unfruitful.   

I'm no fan of Osteen, by any stretch of the imagination, but your entry doesn't seem all that encyclopedic, nor is it all that notable to an entry about Osteen or his church, nor does it appear to fit with the Biographies of Living Persons policy.  If Wikipedia listed every crackpot (not necessarily saying that you are one) that protested outside a church building, or wrote a book critical of a church/pastor, there'd be little room for anything else.  It also seems you're using this article as a coat-rack to promote your book.  If this event is all that notable, it will be widely covered by the media and have a broader impact than what currently appears to exist.  I cannot stand Osteen and the prosperity gospel he espouses, and I might likely agree with your book (though I doubt I'd ever buy it), but your information is tangentially related to him and doesn't belong here...

The """"critical reception of the series"""" section has been amended to reflect data taken directly from the series.  It does not speculate on reasons for the data, beyond identifying trends.  That the wife of the series editor appeared in the series, where the series editor is the primary screener of selections (but does not make final selections), is a notable fact, however one interprets it.  Given that Lehman has indicated thousands, if not tens of thousands, of poems are read for each issue of the anthologyand only 75 get inthe selection of his wife, who does not meet the notability criteria for a writer on Wikipedia, and has not published extensively elsewhere, is relevant to criticism of the series. The same can be said for those who have assisted Lehman with the production of the series, as well as those who have worked with or studied under Lehman.  Whether or not the trends are dispositive is beside the point (though mathematically, they are """"statistically significant""""); the point is that criticism of the series is based on this information.  While the blogosphere may not a preferred citation, previous edits of this entry prove that if it were necessary to establish (for the """"critical reception"""" portion of the entry, not the entry proper) the above criticism as pervasive in the only sphere it is alleged (in the article) to be pervasivethe blogosphereit would be a matter of picking which high-traffic links (of the dozens available) to select, and not whether any could be found.  On the blogosphere, it is simply the case that discussion of the BAP does not occur outside the context, or exclusive of the backdrop, of persistent allegations of cronyism against the series, and that it is the data that fuels this speculation, not whimsy or fancy.

 What are you talking about? What you did is the fill-in-the-blank question:
Gusuku ... often refers to castles or fortresses in ______ that feature stone walls.
 And your answer is """"the Ryukyu Islands."""" That's wrong in the sense that we wouldn't say, """"We speak Germanic"""" when we actually speak English. Castles or fortresses that feature stone walls are typical of Okinawa. Applying the term to other island groups is highly problematic to say the least.
 Narratives about gusuku are truly chaotic. No wonder you don't understand the situation correctly. No one can define the meaning of gusuku, which reminds me of family resemblance. What's why I avoided the """"A is B"""" definition and used """"A often refers to B"""" in the article. Explaining many conflicting theories as I did in the article is confusing. So I present just one hypothesis which I personally support:
 The word gusuku originally meant stone walls that, say, partitioned agricultural fields. In other words, the word gusuku was not associated with castles. This meaning survives in Yaeyama.
 There has been a long tradition of mountain cult. At first, the word gusuku was not associated with mountain cult.
 In Amami, medieval mountain fortifications, that are typical of mainland Japan, were constructed, probably in response to Ryūkyū's repeated invasions. At this stage, the word gusuku was not associated with these mountain fortifications.
 In Okinawa, some sacred mountains were later fortified with stone walls. One consequence of the fusion of mountain cult and fortification was the association of the word gusuku with mountain cult and/or fortification. The association of gusuku with stonework was weakened, but anyway Okinawa's castles and fortresses had stone walls.
 Ryūkyū finally conquered Amami and introduced the noro ritual system to Amami. The new meanings of gusuku (1. related to mountain cult, 2. fortification) were also introduced to Amami. Most of the former medieval mountain fortifications were abandoned, but some were transformed into sacred places and given the name of gusuku even though they lacked stone walls. Some people of Amami might have interpreted the word gusuku as fortifications regardless of whether they had stone walls. Others reinterpreted the word as a sacred place regardless of whether it had stone walls. For this reason, some gusuku are on sand dunes, on cliff edges, and in caves.
 Archaeologists of Okinawa Prefecture re-used the word gusuku as a technical term (yet another meaning). This was the source of confusion. They referred to Okinawa's castles and fortresses that feature stone walls as gusuku. They met fierce oppositions from folklorists because their use of gusuku was not grounded in people's actual usages.
 Some archaeologists of Okinawa Prefecture attempted to extend the gusuku-as-fortifications framework to Amami, Miyako and Yaeyama, regardless of whether local people referred to the target as gusuku (The remains of human settlements of Yaeyama are not called gusuku by local people either). They met fierce oppositions not only from folklorists but also from fellow archaeologists.
 It is convenient to consider a dichotomy between inductive and deductive reasoning. Linguists, folklorists and ethnologists base their arguments on people's actual usages and try to infer a generalized conclusion from them. By contrast, archaeologists often define a term, independently of people's actual usages, and apply it to those which meet the definition. Due to lack of written materials, archaeologists need to name archaeological findings by themselves. So they naturally clash with scholars from other disciplines.
 It is important to note that the gusuku-as-fortifications framework (that's what the lead sentence says) is no longer supported in the archaeology of the Amami Islands. The renaming of so-called """"Uragami Gusuku"""" was a symbolic event. A gusuku is a gusuku only because people refer to it as such. It's not because the referent meets some definition. In Amami, gusuku (as a technical term) is dead, long live gusuku (as to people's actual usages)!   """,0.0

 Source Material 

Please have links at the bottom to """"witch"""" websites, or wikipedia articles dealing with witches.  Witch Hunter Robin makes a lot of references to the occult that I think it would be helpful if the article covered some of it.  Not all, just enough for more pleasant viewing of the anime.  Obviously most fans of the show are probably into that stuff themselves, and, at the risk of getting into stereotypes, most of them are probably goth chicks or feminist types who like """"strong female leads,"""" e.g. Robin Sena, the main character.  Nevertheless, a substantial number of people, otakus or new fans to Anime, I think would apreciate it, if anime articles would cover whatever references an anime uses.  One of the things I find most annoying about Wikipedia anime articles is that they do not cover references enough.  For example; Shura No Toki is full of historical references, yet, the article on that anime on Wikipedia does not cover it.  Furthermore, for the anime """"Gilgamesh,"""" some background, however brief as needed, would be helpful regarding semitic mythology, not to mention """"remedial"""" quantum physics, as the anime makes extensive use of them.  Without semitic mythology, and a basic understanding of quantum physics, """"Gilgamesh"""" is unwatchable.  You have to be a Jewish college student majoring in Physics, or someone who has read extensively about Judaism and Physics, to understand what the hell is going on.  Ghost in The Shell, similarly, it uses so much computer jargon, part of the reason it has only RECENTLY become popular, is because computer jargon has become a part of the cultural lingo.  Before, animes like GITS were very audience exclusive.  For reference please, consider what I said; no need to turn an article into a mini novel, just some brief coverage, or at least links to the themes, science or history the animes touched on.

Aristotle is a Macedonian

I am perplexed to see that this article makes no mention that Aristotle was born in Macedonia. His father was a physician to the Macedonian king and upon his fathers death, Aristotle was sent to study in Greece with Plato. I understand there is much strif between modern Greeks and Macedonians about ancient culture in the balkan region today, but we must look at the facts, especially in articles which are being viewed by millions of people. The fact that Aristotle taught another Macedonian, Alexander the Great, makes their relationship a very logical one, especially since Aristotle's father had previously served the Macedonian rulers in the past, it is only fitting that the king of Macedonia, King Philip, would trust Aristotle to teach his son. To the authors of this article, please include this in this article.  

The first sentence of """"Life"""" states, correctly, """"Aristotle was born in Stagira in Thrace.""""  Chalcidice was part of Thrace in ancient times.  The information about Aristotle's connection to the Macedonian court is abundantly mentioned: in the first sentence of the article, and in the second sentence of """"Life"""": """"His parents were Phaestis and Nicomachus, who became physician to King Amyntas of Macedon.""""  It looks to me like the article is doing a good job being factual; theories like """"makes their relationship a very logical one"""" are in some danger of being original research, though I don't know enough about Aristotle's family to say whether there is meaningful ancient evidence that goes beyond the way the article represents things.

Hello again. I'll respond to your note on my page a little here. First of all, I don't have a negative attitude towards the Romans, or the Greeks, or the Macedonians or anyone from Western antiquity. I'm really not that interested in Classical history beyond basic knowledge. What I AM interested in is keeping the wiki clean.

As far as having the article locked, it was put into what's called """"semi-protected"""" mode. In semi-protect, anonymous users cannot edit the article, and neither can newly  registered accounts. This is to prevent vandalism from occuring - people putting in nonsense or swearing for no reason, that kind of thing. By the time you read this note you should have had your account long enough that you can now edit the article. I will warn you that trying to put in uncited material or stuff that goes against the manual of style will probably be deleted again, although not by me.

Another suggestion would be to use the Apollo discussion page to air your concerns. Two of the five wikiprojects that have staked a claim on Apollo ( Wikiproject Classical Greece and Rome and  Wikiproject Mythology) are known for their accuracy and attention to detail. They can probably give you reasons for why the content looks like it does. 

One last note, if you want to leave me a message again, please to it here at this link to my talk page, rather than on my main user page. That way I get a note telling me you want to talk to me, rather than having to wait until I stumble across your posting. Either way, good luck.   talk """,0.0

NotARealWord said, quote """"What do you mean? The statement about their """"100% clean award"""" is cited."""" Are you for real, or you want to insult my/users’ intelligence? What, you have another set of policies about reliable sources and self promotion means? WHO MADE THAT STATEMENT ABOUT 100% CLEAN AWARD? Can you answer me SAREKofVULCAN?

And 3r, THIS IS PROOF THAT AMOUNG this team of editors that are against me, are some like (NotARealWord) which is (SAREK here is another personal attack according to your definition) or in a hurry to close my mouth, or just incompetent.

Conclusion: my belief is that (I cannot pinpoint) or/and there is a matter of incompetence from the editor's part, some Wikipedia/Softpedia interests or just a vendetta.

"Your Ali Revision 

Hi, Zora; I thought about your latest revision on Ali regarding the events that occurred shortly after Muhammad's death, and concluded that it is a vast improvement over the past versions.  For one, it is far more preciseit is far from clear upon Muhammad's death that Ali's followers thought Ali SHOULD succeed.  What is more clear is that once Abu Bark assumed the caliphate position, his followers did think that if anyone, Ali should have been the successor.  Excellent work.  I'm just going to do a very small revision clarifying that it was not only Ali's friends and followers but many other Muslims who thought Ali should have succeeded.

After reviewing the deletion, I think the error is technical.  I am on a Hughes Sat network that uses transparent proxies.  This was causing me to log in and out from page to page.  The original article which was not the correct article went through and posted when I switched to SSL wiki server.  This was unexpected, and as I was editing the article to the correct format it was deleted. (roughly 60-90 seconds from the originally post)   Due to this technical error the correct post was never entered into wiki.

This would have been the correct post if the article had not been deleting during editing and if I had not had technical issues which inadvertly caused me to post the incorrect format of the article.

So I think I understand why my original post was deleted - basically because I was unable to enter the correct article within the 90 seconds from creation to deletion.  If this is correct, can you please tell me if this article would be acceptable.

"""""""Some Palestinian scholars are using the etymological relationship between the word """"Palæstina"""" and """"Philistine"""" to pretend that the Palestinians are the remnants, even are themselves the true Philistines, and not the descendants of Arab conquerors mixed with native populations of Jewish, Hellenistic, Arabic or Aramaic descent, who inhabited Byzantine Palestine before the Arab conquest. Moreover, (ab)using this historically inconsistent argument, they go further to say that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict dates back to biblical times. Linking the Palestinian/Philistines to their supposedly Indo-European ancestors, they argue that the Jews (an anachronism since at that period they did not exist as Jews, before the Babylonian Exile) stole the Land of the Palestinians at that very early period. This way of importing Nazi style propaganda into the conflict is widely spread in some far-right movements and has some misled followers outside those circles, unfortunately many """"philistines"""" use it in an undiscriminating way.""""

 UNBLOCK ME YOU ASSHOES! 

{{unblock|HAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA UNBLOCK ME OR I WILL VANDALISE MORE!!!!

It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.

Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.

As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.

The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.

It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.

The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.

No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.

I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as she slept.",0.42857142857142855

 Wikipedia """"Patricia Cornwell"""" page libelous, being used for felony fraud crimes 

The main Wikipedia """"Patricia Cornwell"""" page is not only libelous, defamatory, false and misleading, but it is also being used to support felony crimes of fraud and extortion. The page itself is a felony criminal act of obstruction of justice, because it uses the Wikipedia public forum to give a false report of previously committed crimes. Wikipedia contributors may face felony indictment as well as civil charges by maintaining these materials online.

Demand is hereby made that you stop these criminal acts on the Wikipedia site, and that you remove the libelous, defamatory, false, fraudulent and misleading material that violates Wikipedia's own policies.

The page is the alleged biography page for author Patricia Cornwell, a page which appears to have been seized by partisans under Cornwell's influence or on her payroll. These partisans have authored false and fraudulent material, and reject and delete factual material that displeases Cornwell.

I am Patricia Cornwell's leading biographer, and also one of many victims of crimes committed by Cornwell.

The Wikipedia main page on Cornwell is a brief piece of pro-Cornwell propaganda, which hides and falsifies her long life of multiple scandals. A large part of the page is a libelous attack on myself, with a criminally fraudulent report of the crimes Cornwell committed against me.

As shown in court filings and public documents, Cornwell hired thugs to threaten to have me illegally jailed and murdered, and funded a fraud scheme in a Southern court to try and ban my freedom of speech. Your Wikipedia page falsifies the report of these crimes, and mounts a highly personal libelous attack against me.

Patricia Cornwell is a longtime friend of the President Bush family and some FBI agents, and has used these connections to escape prosecution for a series of crimes and offenses, clearly evident in public records and court documents.

Your Wikipedia page, seemingly written under the sway of the criminal Cornwell, hides the real facts about her life. A few words of sycophantic praise for Cornwell, and then a brief section on """"Controversies"""" which ignores her actual huge history of scandals that is evident from court records and published articles, like when Cornwell was sued for stealing the private autopsy reports of murdered children and copying them nearly verbatim into her novels.

You are invited to read Cornwell's genuine biography, widely available online, """"Patricia Cornwell Biography: Crime, Bribery, Scandal and Mental Illness"""". Researchers can already have an advance copy of my upcoming biography book on Cornwell, which extensively quotes primary sources and which can background a Wikipedia article to replace the libelous propaganda you have now.

It seems the main purpose of your current short Wikipedia Cornwell """"biography"""" page is to launch a libelous attack on myself, to try and discredit my work and my upcoming major book on Cornwell.

I have tried to begin to edit out the falsehoods and fraudulent statements in your article, but the Cornwell partisans who control the Wikipedia page immediately re-installed the pro-Cornwell lies and libelous propaganda.

The specific attacks on me in your Wikipedia article, are direct propaganda in line with Cornwell's hired thugs. Regarding the specifics of these false statements:

The article accuses me of making public """"plagiarism"""" accusations about Cornwell, regarding a book that she delayed and re-wrote after my private protests. The Wikipedia statements are false, deceptive and misleading. The Wikipedia claims are propaganda, originally laid out by the Cornwell lawyers to set up the lawsuit to ban my freedom of speech, propaganda they set out in a fraudulent article that, as documents show, was planted in the Republican Richmond Times-Dispatch newspaper by the Cornwell lawyers themselves. The Times-Dispatch is a newspaper closely tied to Patricia Cornwell, and the """"reporter"""" who wrote the fraudulent article never met me and never interviewed me.

I appreciate the computer's catching three syntax errors in the article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st_Aerospace_Control_Squadron.  These have been around several years but it is good to know about them.

They occur in the lists of personnel at 1st Aero, their job descriptions (showing now jobs were defined and allocated to different ranks), and the courses offered as training in the development of the squadron's activities for the first formative years.  However, a few days ago, I had occasion to look at the article and saw that, last year, someone had removed all  this detailed personnel information except for the list of Squadron Commanders.  I restored this information recently, but it has again been removed with the comment by BB-PB

grossly excessive level of detail - none of these people are notable

It is a matter of opinion whether, as trackers of man-made satellite, people who have done things that have never before been done in human history are or are not notable.

Is there any way to appeal this decision on the grounds that the listing provides useful historical detail not available elsewhere about the organizational progress of early satellite tracking in the US?  My Ph.D. is in Management Theory so I think this is worthwhile information that should not be suppressed.

I removed the list of Commanders (as that is trivial compared to the other information) and inserted this remark):

""""The historical development of the Squadron is shown by detailed listings of personnel with dates and citations. However, a Wikipedia monitor refuses to allow this level of detail. Copies of the information are available on request from the author.""""
The list of commanders has again been restored, repacing my comment, and I have removed it as they are not notable  it is the workers who did something special.
But the commanders are again restored.

If an appeal is permitted, please tell me how to do that.  seaotter6@aol.com""",0.0

Wikipedia Founder Hit With Relationship Trouble, Allegations of Excessive Spending
By Megan McCarthy March 03, 2008 | 3:34:58 PMCategories: People  
Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales didn't have such a good weekend. First the blogosphere and then Wikipedia itself lit up with news of his messy breakup with controversial Canadian TV pundit Rachel Marsden. Now, accusations are flying that Wales has been living the high life on the expense account of the nonprofit foundation he created.
On Friday, reports surfaced that the married-but-divorcing Internet icon carried on a clandestine affair with Marsden.  Evidence of the affair included lurid IM transcripts, which appeared on Silicon Valley gossip blog Valleywag. On Saturday, Wales posted a statement on the Wikipedia Foundations website (which he later moved to his personal site) denying that his actions went against Wikimedia Foundation's policies, and stating that the affair had ended. Marsden responded by listing the clothes that he left at her house up for auction on eBay.
So, what's the big deal when a relationship goes sour? Well, the two met when Marsden contacted Wales to help her """"clean up"""" what she perceived to be errors on her personal Wikipedia page, and there have been allegations that Wales used his influence to improperly make changes.
Former associates of Wales' are using this scandal to bring up other worries they have about the organization of the foundation. Former Wikimedia exec Danny Wool, who left the foundation last year, wrote a blog post insinuating that Wales used the non-profit foundation as his own personal piggy bank. Expenses that Wales tried to apply to the foundation included $300+ bottles of wine and visits to Moscow massage parlors, Wool alleges. According to Wool, the expenses got so out of hand that the Wikimedia foundation took away Wales' corporate credit card.
""""There were occasions where he used [the Wikimedia Foundation] for personal advancement under the guide of the mission.  And, as someone who was in there for the mission part of it, I found that rather distressful,"""" Wool told EPICENTER.
Wales did not immediately respond to a request for comment.""",0.2857142857142857

Call Sign Meaning
I've been adding WISconsiN as a call sign meaning for quite some time now only to have it deleted by another user who INSISTS that the only possible meaning for the calls is the defunct WISconsin News newspaper.  As far as I know, there is no official documentation or credible source that states that the calls are a reference to the newpaper and the newspaper ALONE.  So who's to say the calls weren't also chosen because it was an abbreviation of the state's name?  There's plenty of examples of a station using calls with multiple meanings (such as WBBM-TV out of Chicago).  But my main sticking point is that WISN has referenced the calls while advertising itself as """"WISconsiN TV"""" (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JFirQUXfc8)  My theory is that the station chose to keep the calls after the newspaper folded because they referenced the state's name as well (the station had only been using the calls for a few years when the paper folded, so the """"name recognition"""" argument is moot).  But regardless of why they kept the calls, I think the fact that the station made a conscious decision to use them to brand itself as """"Wisconsin TV"""" deserves mention.  """,0.0

Quote from Peter Sugar, """"The Early History and the Establishment of the Ottomans in Europe"""": There the Hungarian-Wallachian alliance was still in effect, and Bayezid I now moved against Mircea. Once again, many Christians, mostly Serbs, fought in his army, including Kraljevic (the son of the king) Marko, the hero of another famous Epic, who died not in that battle, but in the Battle of Arges which Bayezid fought with the Wallachians on May 17, 1395. Mircea appears to have been victorious militarily, but his forces and resources were so depleted that he had to acknowledge the loss of the Dobrudja, into which Bayezid moved Turkish garrisons. He also had to accept the status of an Ottoman vassal and pay regular tribute. This arrangement lasted until the Danubian Principalities regained their independence. Although it created problems for the Romanians, it saved them from the much harsher treatment that went with direct Ottoman rule, especially during the centuries of decline.  """,0.0

Well, thank you for your comprehensive answer. You certainly didn't need to provide an explanation and I'm sorry if I gave you that impression, but your comments explain a lot so there is some value there. Circumstances like yours can cause problems when we have guidelines like WP:QUACK; I'm sure you understand what I mean.

I'm not an admin and so can't (and wouldn't) really close the AFD, though as a non-admin I can re-list it to encourage more people to look at the article and did. My impression at this stage is that most editors seem to think Mr Roberts doesn't meet our general notability guideline because he hasn't received enough coverage in reliable sources. That he has won an award for his blog wouldn't normally make him notable unless it was a very significant award. Winning a notable award doesn't necessarily make someone notable either. But it's also possible that someone who isn't notable now, might very well be notable in the future. We call that WP:TOOSOON. In cases like that, the best bet would be to ask for the article to be userfied which means it is moved to your own user space until the subject is notable enough for the article to be published in the main article space. I have a couple of articles like that sitting in my own userspace. 

At the end of the day, it's not really about """"protecting"""" an article from deletion, it's about the Wikipedia community protecting the encyclopaedia from the inclusion of everyone and everything, ever. So we set and adhere to particular standards and things that don't meet those standards (even things that might one day meet them) are deleted. My best suggestion would be that you spend some time editing the articles of some very obviously notable people before trying to create articles for people who might not be. That way, if one of your articles is taken to AFD, at least you'll have a much broader understanding of policy and deletion procedures. At the moment you seem to be fighting a losing battle and that can be very upsetting, especially if people are throwing all sorts of linked acronyms at you that you've never seen. 111 """,0.0

It look horrendous. Oh and her eyes are lighter than her hair and you keep saying they're the same shade, when clearly they're not. Lets take a look at a better quality image. No brown eyes here.)

3(These eyes can still be called hazel.) 4(Hazel eyes due to their nature have the tendency to look goldish brown in certain lights, and look at Belle's hair it looks red). 5(I can clearly see her eyes are not the same as her hair, in fact take a close look when a lock of hair falls in front of her right eyes and clashes with her eyes color. The difference looks brown and hazel, instead of brown and light brown.) 6(That's not a screenshot, and by magnifying the image, her eyes look dark hazel and so not the same color as her hair) 7(400% zoom in, hazel eyes) 8(What a desperate image, you can barely see anything, 1000% zoom in and her eyes appear not to be brown again). 9(400% zoom in, hazel eyes... again)

Oh yes, the Belle merchandise that has her with brown eyes is so big, only one of the pictures you send can sort of qualify. 10 (By magnifying the image up to 400%, you can clearly see her eyes look green-like). 11(400% zoom in, hazel eyes AGAIN)

These are just a couple of additions to the pictures you presented, further cementing that Belle has hazel eyes instead of brown.

I am changing this to simply , """"In front of the Dalang is a Plangkan (a type of table with holes punched in its surface), on which the necessary puppets sit ready for use. 

I think (but am not certain) that the that the untranslated part is more or less a joke: roughly, that there what is on the table is not a foo foo drink for the puppets.

Arme durch je ein Stab, der an der Hand befestigt ist beweglich) , geschnitzte, bemalte und bekleidete Figuren, die an Fäden gezogen wurden, Malereien auf Schautafeln oder geweihte und verkleidete Menschen.

I've rendered this """"The figures in these puppet plays were wayang golek (normally a head assembly connected by a straight stick to a trunk, allowing the head to swivel.

If you know better, please correct the article (and make a note here that you've done so).   18:03, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)

Your translation seems OK. Geweihte could also mean """"horned"""", which would make sense in the case of demons. """"Sanctified"""", as in """"blessed"""", makes less sense in the context.  12:44, 5 Jun 2004 (UTC)

Another tricky one: Wayang-Klitik-Figuren meist erheblich beschädigt, sehr zum Gaudium der Zuschauer..."""" I haven't even ventured a translation for this, it has several words I don't properly know. Is Gaudium perhaps the Latin word, as in """"gaudeamus igitur""""?   18:03, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)  This has now been satisfactorily rendered.   05:40, Jun 5, 2004 (UTC)

Another problematic sentence: Aus diesem Grunde haben Wayang-Klitik-Figuren, die zu Spielen herangezogen werden und dort Kampfszenen zu durchstehen haben, Arme aus Leder. I currently have this partially translated as """"On this basis the wayang klitik figures have, die zu Spielen herangezogen werden and where battle scenes zu durchstehen haben, leather arms."""" I know that durchstehen is to stand one's ground, but I still can't fully translate the sentence.   18:17, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)  This has now been satisfactorily rendered.   05:40, Jun 5, 2004 (UTC)

And another: Aus Jenggala und Kediri stammen die Geschichten von Raden Panji und Cindelaras, die ein paar Dorfjungen mit ihren Kampfhähnen erleben. The first part is """"From Jenggala and Kediri come the stories of Raden Panji and Cindelara,"""" I'm not at all clear on the latter part. My dictionary says Kampfhähnen are literally fighting cocks, but can just be pugnacious people.   19:46, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)

""": Hi Hanely, and others,

First, a further clarification on the concept behind wikipedia, neutrality is a fundamental pillar, but there are two others as well, no original research and verifiability.  This takes us into the """"weasel words"""" you mention, which it's true is an area where improvements are needed with the article.  A reader should be able to independently check everything written in a wikipedia article should they want to, and as such, wikipedia is more about providing verifiable information rather than what a given editor simply thinks or believes is """"true.""""  You specifically cite the Criticism section, and I agree.  """"Plagiarism"""" has evolved the furthest of the three subsections IMO and is solidly referenced with verifiable sources (I think the believer stance(s) aren't presented as well as they could though), and the same should probably be done for """"Science"""" and """"Revelation"""".  For instance, one thing that can be done for """"Revelation"""" is cite the low book sales and distribution of the TUB instead of the simple current statement that it isn't widespread.  """"Peacock terms"""" have been an ongoing challenge from my perspective, commonly inserted throughout the article in a way that aggrandizes the book, but I think this is currently toned down.

What I'm hearing from you Hanely overall is a suggestion to focus on TUB alone, make the article perhaps a book summary with some history added, and put everything else in other articles.  It is one way to go, and you specifically mention Criticism-related topics as being placed elsewhere.  This would also need to be true of the adherents section and anything """"pro"""".  I don't agree with this tactic however, for reasons of wikipedia policy and overall usefulness to the average reader.  What makes TUB interesting and worth writing & reading about is that it purports to be more than a typical religious book, and people accept it as such.  I think that is a highly intertwined element of the TUB topic, and it fits in this article, and by the same token the reasons people *don't* accept it as such is part of the story.  I think it is a challenge to have the article reflect these differing perspectives, but that's a basic challenge involved with wikipedia articles in a nutshell.  Writing separate articles for separate points of view is discouraged.  See POV forking.

I think there needs to be a top-level article that is a summary of The Urantia Book basics, its teachings, its history, and those who are pro and con on topics related to it.  Other articles can then develop certain topics in more depth, if needed or wanted.  I don't see why the top-level article shouldn't be this one, it already serves as that, and other similar topics on wikipedia are structured the same way (for instance A Course in Miracles isn't a simple book synopsis & some words about the history, but covers pro and con viewpoints, as does Book of Mormon, which also has a plagiarism section).  I certainly do not accept that for some reason everything to do with Criticism should be tucked away in separate articles.  This is inherently biased toward the idea that the main wikipedia article is only for those seeking viewpoints where nothing negative is said.  Audiences also come to learn about contrary viewpoints, and those viewpoints are just as valid.

On the points you brought up, my thoughts:

1.  I've seen a tendency over the 1+ year I've followed this wikipedia article off and on for people to add many digressions to the article.  And understandably so, TUB is enormous and has thousands of interesting details and side stories.  But not all will fit in the main article.  I've seen multiple people each add a few sentences here and there, and over time, the article has become enormous and unfocused with all sorts of illogical disorganized digressions.  Like you say, this article can stand to be streamlined (you should have seen what it's been like before!).  IMO, the Lucifer rebellion story, while interesting, doesn't quite make the cut in terms of being essential enough to mention on the main page.  Perhaps an article summarizing TUB's view of the history of earth is worthwhile to build up?  The Lucifer / Caligastia / Satan story would fit in article such as that, for example.

2.-5.  Like I've said, Criticism is appropriate to have, as is the view of believers, and a POV fork is contrary to wikipedia standards.  In terms of Gardner specifically, despite any opinions on his conclusions about TUB, his book is one of the few published about TUB to analyze it from a nonbeliever perspective and it's entirely appropriate to use and cite as reference material for the article.  I say that even though I'm not personally convinced by arguments he makes.  I've read his book, have access to a copy, and can make edits regarding i",0.0

The only accurate way to assess the opinions of a large group of scientists is to poll them, as every researcher does not necessarily believe every word in a study they participate in.

"""I believe a number of statements from this supplement to WP:OR are relevant to this discussion:
Obvious deductions are not original research.  This includes simple logical deductions. For example, if A is in district B, and district B is in province C, then A is in province C. This is a simple syllogism. Included are all of the other simple deductions. It is an obvious deduction that Lea's Shield is the same class of device as the FemCap.
Identifying synonymous terms, and collecting related information under a common heading is also part of writing an encyclopedia. Reliable sources do not always use consistent terminology, and it is sometimes necessary to determine when two sources are calling the same thing by different names. This does not require a third source to state this explicitly, as long as the conclusion is obvious from the context of the sources. U.K. sources use the term """"cervical cap"""" to refer to multiple devices available in that country .  Many older U.S. sources use the term """"cervical cap"""" to refer exclusively to the Prentif device (here effectiveness results for Prentif are labeled only """"cervical cap"""").  A few current U.S. sources (such as those cited by David) use the term """"cervical cap"""" to refer exclusively to the FemCap device.  Some U.S. sources include the Lea's Shield under the cervical cap umbrella.  These are obviously inconsistencies in terminology, and they can be resolved by the judgment and consensus of editors on Wikipedia.
Although the English language version of a source should be used when it is published in multiple languages, foreign language sources are also welcome, and even encouraged to reduce systemic bias. Non-English sources identify the Lea's Shield as a cervical cap.
Sources may be written in a fictional, nationalistic, religious or other narrow context. Material from these sources incorporated in Wikipedia must be placed in a broader, more encyclopedic context. Placing material in an encyclopedic context is different from taking things out of context. For example... material written from a localized or nationalistic perspective must be presented in a perspective consistent with a world-wide viewpoint... This is not original research when good editorial judgment is used. Taking material from the U.S. - where only one cervical cap (first Prentif, then later FemCap) was available for many decades, and so """"cervical cap"""" is synonymous with a single device - and presenting it in a perspective consistent with a world-wide viewpoint where multiple cervical caps are available at the same time, and so the definition of cervical cap is broader and includes Lea's Shield, is allowed and even encouraged on Wikipedia.

I am not attached to the title of """"cervical cap"""" for this article.  I believe the best editorial decision would be to merge Lea's Shield into this article, but, like David and Una, I am open to looking for a new name.  Anon, are you willing to consider a merge with a name change?  If so, we can discuss alternatives to """"cervical barrier"""", which you have objected to. Talk     C

 Thoughts on a """"high school"""" A7 

As I am, of course, well aware following my RfA, CSD A7 explicitly exempts schools.  Do you believe that it applies to """"online"""" schools; specifically, Denver Online High School?  I just removed the speedy deletion template, though I'm not really sure it qualifies for the exception.  Looking at their webpage (just added as an EL to the article), it looks like they probably are real, and seem at least somewhat connected to the Denver public school system (though they also seem to charge fees, which confuses me).  If the are operated by the State, then they probably even meet the general """"All high schools are automatically notable"""" AfD exemption.  

Obviously, the article needs clean-up, but I'd rather wait and see if it should even be an article before doing so.   
This is indeed  a public school, though private high schools are just as notable as public ones. (I don't see a mention of fees, but most public schools do collect some sort of fee, and almost all charge tuition to students from outside their district.) The article however was totally unacceptablemainly devoted to the names of the teachers. I removed that, but there is still much necessary rewriting.  The real question for an online school at this or any level  would be whether it is actually a separate school, or merely a programwe cannot necessarily go by the name it calls itself. If a program, it would best go in the article for the Denver Board of Education. My feeling is that it an actual  separate school, but for something like this, a 3rd party reference will be really helpful.  What it clearly is not is a mere tutoring center or support facility, which are almost never notable.   ' ( talk ) 
That all sounds very reasonable to me; I figured erring on the side of caution (removing the A7) was the better choice.  Thanks for the trimming; I'll go take a look and see if I can find any sort of third party sources.    

 Notability of high schools 

Hi  I hope you have been well.  I seem to recall, and have stated (or mis-stated, as the case may be) that I thought you may have said in the past that (verifiable) high schools are generally presumptively notable.  But, in the event I've mis-spoken as to what you said, feel free to correct me.  I made mention of my recollections at an AfD where I've not myself !voted (as of yet), here:  Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mesivta Tiferes Yisroel.  Best.  
such is the accepted compromise: high schools have articles, elementary schools in the absence of special notability get merged. But the compromise , like all informal and formal Wikipedia rules, has effect only as long as people here want it to have effect. I think recent decisions have upheld this in general, but there are always one or two people who challenge it. Such is probably the case here,There may be other factors, though, which I mention them at the AfD. ' ( talk ) 

Inherent notability for elementary schools which have been """"Blue Ribbon Schools""""
I am contacting you because you participated in either the AFD Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Kennedy Middle School (Cupertino, California) which resulted in a redirect or the deletion review Wikipedia:Deletion review#Kennedy Middle School (Cupertino, California) which resulted in restoration of the article because it was once a """"Blue Ribbon School"""". I have opened a discussion at Wikipedia talk:Notability (organizations and companies)#US elementary schools: Inherent notability: for """"Blue Ribbon Schools"""" as to whether the 5200 schools which have been found awarded the """"Blue Ribbon"""" seal of approval get inherent notability, or if they each have to satisfy WP:ORG via significant coverage in multiple reliable and independent sources. Your input is welcome. Thanks!    
P.S. Should I have made this a """"RFC?"""" I rarely get involved in such general policy forums.   
the way we've been doing it recently, it would best be to be made an RfC. But it should not be worded """"inherent notability """" but """"presumption of notability"""", and, personally, though I care relatively little for these articles one way or anot",0.0

The major problem I see in doing this is that using only secondary sources, which I assume is desired, will result in an attackee timeline, for events during the attack, that's composed largely of McGonagle's recall of the attack (i.e., COI findings about events during the attack, and their sequence, are almost exclusively based on McGonagle's testimony; and the NSA History Report used the COI findings as a reference source).  So, for the attackee, the timeline may represent the """"official view,"""" as reported in NSA's History Report; but its base information source, McGonagle testimony, can be easily shown as being fraught with errors.

On January 17, 2000, for the first time, Martin Luther King Day was officially observed in all 50 states.[4] Prior to that New Hampshire and Arizona did not observe the day.

In fact, New Hampshire passed """"Civil Rights Day"""" in 1991, to honor Dr King, and other civil rights activists like Rosa Parks and Malcolm X.  Since the article states clearly that other states, such as Utah, have different names for the holiday, including combining it with Confederate military heroes, this sentence does not seem justifiable.  The article leaves the impression that New Hampshire was some sort of bigoted state, that was one of the last to recognize this holiday.

Within the medical establishment, a medical student who has not yet received his or her MD is referred to as an """"undergraduate"""", in contrast with residents who've received their MDs but are not yet board-certified.  In that context, a medical student is an """"undergraduate"""" because he or she has not graduated from the MD program.  However, that does not mean that an MD is an """"undergraduate degree"""" as that term is usually understood in the US.  That term is reserved for bachelor degrees; any program (such as medical school or law school) which is generally attained after four-year college is called a """"graduate program"""", and the degrees it grants are """"graduate degrees"""".

I think that the current wording is adequate to avoid this confusion.  It's worth noting that in practice, it's extremely rare to find a medical student in the US who doesn't already have a degree from a four-year college.

 Dubious claim
The claim that Russia invented the lightning rod is doubtful for two reasons. First, it is unverifiable that Nevyansk tower, built between 1725 and 1732 was intended for the specific purpose of being utilized a lightning rod. Whather it was used as a lightning rod, it remains unverifiable. Secondly, I probably would believe such a claim if there was a in fact citation referenced in this article that is written in the English language. All we are given is an inappropriate and unacceptable reference in the form of a web page written in Russian that to English speakers, is totally useless to verify such a claim. This is English Wikipedia, not Russian Wikipedia. And thirdly, by conducting my own research, there is a vast consensus by doing a search engine which shows that by far and large, Benjamin Franklin is attributed to inventing the lightning rod, regardless if others may have built a rod that was unintended for such a purpose.

 Hi there 

My block expired a few hours ago and I wanted to ask you if you had the chance to review the case. As I understand it I was blocked for WP:NPA after stating several times the editor Wee Curry Monster was making """"untrue statements"""" purposely misrepresenting my comments. Prior to that I addressed them as """"lies"""" but after I was advised not to do so (in the last ANI) I stopped. I see now that """"untrue statements"""" isn't acceptable either. Fair enough I shall not use the word """"lies"""" or """"untrue statements"""" again. Now this raises the obvious question: what should I do when this editor purposely makes a misrepresentation of comments/facts in a discussion? I can present the evidence for this editor doing so quite a number of times (I actually did at the last ANI). I'd have no problem in assuming good faith if it weren't for the fact that he never once either apologized or acknowledged having done so. What should I do as an editor when another editor behaves like this over and over again?
Also, if you have the time could you please drop by the talk page Talk:Falkland_Islands_sovereignty_dispute and the ANI report and tell me if you believe editors Wee and Kahastok are properly interpreting the discussion as to give them consensus to delete the whole section from the article?

"It does indeed look very awkward without images but the rules for WP:NFC explicitely state that: The use of non-free media in lists, galleries, discographies, and navigational and user-interface elements is usually unacceptable for failing the test for significance (criterion #8). And right now, I don't see any possibility of Madlax character list being a special case exempt from it. ( Of course, other anime character lists do this all the time but the fact is: it is against the guidelines. And it may even cost the main article its featured status on which I've spent almost year of hard work...
Addressing your suggestion, it is indeed possible to just revert the removal of the images but that won't deal with the source of the problem: the unacceptability of such act under Wikipedia policies, which in turn, stems from the US fair use and copyright laws. Unfortunately, there is very little I can do about the latter, so anyone who'd remove the images again will be formally right AND it will eventually lead to an edit war which is an unconditionally bad development.
Don't think that I don't understand your concern. I too, hate character lists without character portraits and a thought of my favourite anime series having one pains me to no end. But it's just the way Wikipedia is. Being the most popular educational site on the web sadly comes with a price tag. (  ☭",0.0

 Your message 

Sorry for not replying earlier, I wasn't really sure what to say in response to your first message, and besides I've had a million and one things to do recently. Anyway there's a lot of things to be positive about, Red is back (even if he has withdrawn from the ArbCom election), Durin looks to still be around to me, Essjay is probably being more sensible than anyone by not getting involved in stuff. Plus Wikipedia passed 900,000 articles recently (not that anyone seemed to notice in all the hubbub), we're still almost as accurate as Brittanica, and whatever the failings of the ArbCom elections, at least they'll make it more democratic than it has been for the past few months.  """"?!"""" RFR - a good idea? 

P.S. I think I've come up with a compromise for the userbox conflict, basically to delete all the current userbox templates (bear with me) and replace them with equivalents like on Essjay's page using Template:Userbox and a bot. I think this has a number of advantages, but I'm still thrashing out the details. Just wondering (since I haven't really been following Wikiproject Userboxes that closely, only the conflicts around it) has this been suggested before? And what do you think?""",0.0

If there is no published source to back up the fact then the fact does not belong in the biography. See WP:No original research. Wikipedia says it is not enough that your text is true or correct, it must also be previously published.
You can WP:Cite album liner notes even if you don't scan them.

No amount of sense from other editors seems to bring about more sensible editing behaviour nor good communication on the talk page.

2. Revert your attacks on Van Tucky on the talk pages. You come off as a vicious, vile psychopath. If you ever set your cult defending ass in a court of law, the jury would see through your charade in heartbeat.

3. Stop playing good cop- bad cop with your fucking retarded Dahn hack Forestgarden

4. Accept all Korean language sources you stupid bitch!! How dare you try to stifle and censor articles in the name of your fucked up cult. Your Forestgarden bitch believes its within Wiki policy to include Korean language articles when reporting on favorable aspects of your bitch master. Why don't you include all the other more negative portrayals in the Korean language. Also, who said this Itsahappyday fuckhead deserves to translate any Korean? This should all be disputed, you fucking racist, neo-nazi reject?

5. Stop using the word cynical to describe your """"enemies."""" You come off even more retarded than your Ilchee bitch master. Your philosophical maturity is less than that of a first grader. The world is """"cynical."""" Those who don't believe in Dahn are """"cynical."""" I can't wait until South Park makes an episode about your bitch cult. 

6. Are you fucking insane? Korea is the center of the universe? Korea as a cultural hub? Korea the place where the next messiah appears? You Dahn people never cease to amaze when it comes to your thought processes. Korea is not what your Ilchee bitch believes it to be. Think about it retard- the fucking nation of Palau has more of a right to talk about religious heritage than the fucking hermit kingdom. How can you be so retarded, that you choose a Korean cult? If you chose a Chinese or Indian one, at least it would show you have some portion of a brain. Coming to Korea and joining a Korean cult with Korea-centric views is more retarded than travelling to Antartica in search of good coffee while visiting Columbia in search of ice and snow.

7. One more time: the philosophical underpinnings of your shit cult are so flimsy I must question your intelligence.

Adminitis is a state of mind in which some Wikipedians find themselves at times. Though generally confined to administrators, the condition has been observed in some non-administrators. Although the exact causes are unknown, there is thought to be some correlation towards extensive and prolonged anti-vandalism activity.

 Symptoms 
 Strongly believes that all users are equal but admins are more equal than others
 Assumes bad faith frequently
 TLAitis (see WP:WOTTA)
 Stops editing articles, but continuously pontificates about """"writing the encyclopedia""""
 Impatience
 Exhibits immediatism
 Hangs out in project namespace
 Has no time for featured articles
 Frequently refreshes pages to catch the latest change that (of course) needs to be reverted
 Believes that he or she is always right (sorry, EVula...)
 Believes anyone who uses the word 'vote' for 'express a view in a straw poll' should be banned for life
 Originally hailed as the nicest person on the wiki, now reviled as the most hated troll
 Prevents pages from being edited in encyclopedic fashion for policy reasons
 Seems to enjoy biting new users
 General BOFHness
 Strict adherence to """"Wikipedia policy"""" while not using common sense or conversely,
 Strict adherence to ignore all rules, as a strict rule... while not using common sense
 Self-denial. """"This page cannot possibly apply to me""""
 Humor breakdown. """"This page is not funny""""
 Sudden spike in use of specific admin tools, or use of admin tools in areas where he hadn't been using them before
 Requires less and less evidence to be convinced of sock puppetry until confidently asserting that all new users are the same person
 Spends hours writing sarcastic pages about admin behavior
 Believes he is the only real claimant to the """"Defender of the Wiki"""" barnstar
 Exhibits signs of MPOV
 Thinks people are attacking them when they're only trying to be nice
 Has a habit of removing criticism while pretending it's a personal attack
 Indulges in biting delicious newcomers

 Diagnosis 
It is a near universal truth that sufferers from this illness will reject any diagnosis of the condition by an outside party. With that in mind, it's important for those who have received this diagnosis to conduct a self-test. If more than three of the following apply to you, you may be suffering from this illness: 

 You frequently feel that pages are broken and must be deleted (protection is for wusses!).
 """"Everyone is a vandal or a troll, and must be blocked"""" is a recurrent thought.
 """"Blocking people is a punishment! (not a tool to get people to cool down and edit the wiki)"""" is a mantra, not anti-wiki. 
 If you nominate this page for MfD even though it's only 2 minutes since the last revision, you may possibly be suffering from adminitis.
 Corollary: If you speedy, you are certainly suffering from adminitis.
 If you accuse the creators of this article of making a WP:POINT, especially if you forget that making a point does not imply disruption (you need to disrupt to make a point, not make a point to disrupt! -P), you are probably infected. 
 And if you buy the above line of thought, you are definitely infected.

 Pathophysiology 
The infectious nature of this illness is unknown at this time.  More study needs to be conducted in order to identify transmission mechanisms. No effective containment mechanisms have been identified. So far anti-vandal bots have proved immune to this condition, although as yet there is no convincing explanation concerning this anomaly. 

Observational studies have noted that sufferers will seek the counsel of their Wikipedia friends, but end up infecting them in the process. Other studies have noted the evolution of a Wikipedia editor as potentially having a causal role in this illness.

"""It is precisely because Presley is singled out for such criticism that it should be mentioned. Well that is your opinion. I would go a different way: The famous musicians (or their fans) who accused him should show their sources (they have the advantage of being alive and are able to defend themselves against accusations). It would make more sence to me to write about the obvious racism of Chuck D and Mary Blidge and a lot of other famous people than about Elvis' non-exixting racism. I think it's is unfair to the music and cultural impact of Elvis that such things got too much space in the article and other much more essential aspects of Elvis did not get mentioned. I think people who are interested in the person and music of Mary Blidge or Chuck D should discuss it on the discussion site of their articles in wikipedia. They should find out if there is racism or not. Or maybe start an article """"racism in showbussiness"""" and dicuss it there. I think you should not let  it become your problem that some people (for instance Chuck D and Blidge obviously) have problems with 1.Elvis being white , 2.the fact that he was from the rural south, 3.that they believe what other people say only because they share a similar pigmentation and repeat it without checking out any sources or 4.that they wanted get simply attention. By the way - Do you think this musicians ever heard one of  A. Crudup's or Kokomo Arnold's songs or even Roy Brown? I think you could write that Elvis was target of racism and accused of being a racist and mentioning some source and footnotes. But for an article about Elvis it is too detailed the way it is. I think give Elvis credit for what he did - positive and negative - and not for what he did not do.

About Elvis meeting the Beatles: Okay they met and there was no chemistry between them. Did it have any impact on Elvis? He did not like the Beatles before and not after they met. It is another anecdote from Elvis' view. But I think it would be worth reading in a article about the Beatles or John Lennon. He meant much more to them than the other way around (positive or negative). I only gave details about the meeting I've read in a german book which proably was not published in english language. It shows a very negative behavior of Elvis and I wished he would have act different but the sources are that way and having the Beatles Anthology on dvd I could see and hear  Ringo Starr telling the story (only McCartney was very, very kind, maybe even a little bit white washing).

I would like to know what you think about my comments about Berry, Perkins, Kokomo Arnold etc.. I think it tells something about the accusation of stealing music. Heard several years ago an interview with Dave Bartholomew when he played in Switzerland where he said he listened with Fats Domino to many songwriters black and white, blues and country, and he bought the best songs, arranged and changed them and put his name (and Dominos) under it. He said that was common and he knew from some former Ellington musicians that the Duke did the same. 87.162.47.181   Franco, Deutschland

""":: Hmm, Thinking about it, getting involved in a more elaborate argument around the question the question of rigor or lack-there-of is fairly useless. To me, the SI's dismissal of Black Mask seems like a ideal example of rigor but I suspect we'd disagree about a lot. I'll boil the general argument down to the point that the intended mission of wikipedia is producing a neuteral summary of generally agreed facts about historically significant actors, in this case the SI. The question of Debord's dictatorial control is clearly a partisan position, therefore it should hardly be presented prominently (though it's certainly a fact the many have claimed this). The split with the Nashists was *A* significant event during period of development of the Situationists. But to call it *THE* significant event is to make earlier development of group more important than the latter development. Debord and Sanguinetti's book """"The Real Split In The International"""" could just as well be called the """"fundamental split"""" if you took later Situationist developments as more important. Naturally, a neuteral account would take neither position - it could still mention one or both. 
Your claims that my lack of interest in the Nashists represent anti-Scandinavians racism might perhaps be considered another instance of your humor, perhaps? In anycase, the studies of the SI that come to mind are Sadie Plant or Len Bracken. Even Greil Marcus has some useful stuff. Indeed, in the clearly partisan Bob Black essay the introductory paragraphs still winds-up with a somewhat more balanced view of the group than the current entry here (though clearly there's still a """"revive the honor of forgotten Second Situationist Internation"""" thing going on). 
In anycase, I reviewed the history of text and it seem that the first or two paragraphs are essentially tacked-on afterwards. This explains the disjointed quality of the text as a whole - it clearly needs rewriting. 
As far as links go, certainly inclusive links are another option - it is simply that the entry would have to be vastly MORE inclusive than the present entry if you wanted to include all links to comments and critiques on the Situationists.

 Re 

So the same goes for the person I insulted?

Let me help you to be just for one day unbiased:

 It is true that there are """"fringe"""" elements that do not believe in evolution.
 However, someone who did not believe in evolution would have a very difficult time getting into graduate school in biology in any respectable accredited school anyplace in the world.
 Aside from a few religious fundamentalists who somehow feel that evolution challenges their beliefs...
 The antievolutionists are in the same camp as people who believe in extraterrestrials abducting people or cows, or in the Loch Ness Monster, or ghosts, or vampires, or avoiding black cats, or any number of other unfounded beliefs that people adopt.
 ...and nonbelievers in evolution
 Should an article on NASA have a big section on UFOs and UFO abduction of farm animals?
 Why would you think otherwise?
 Among those with advanced training, I would expect this number to be far higher.

I am not going to carry on with this list. If this is the way to go about and insult/attack people in this ambiguous, indirect manner, I'd be glad to change to that way. It would be fun to attack people personally by implying things between the lines, like your buddy did (which you didn't warn). I am a very uncivil and aggressive person, so it would be fun to find alternative ways to personally attack those who do not directly insult me or my culture. Actually, I don't give a crap what you people at Wikipedia think. You're all a bunch of evolutionistic mythologists who are trying to force your lame hypotheses down the throats of those who still have the brain capacity to believe the more sensible alternative theories.

MANILA, Philippines—Media people who attended the press conference of Idols David Cook and David Archuleta were given instructions not to ask three questions.

The off-limits topics included: (1) the recent death of Cook’s brother; (2) Archuleta’s fascination for local diva Regine Velasquez; and (3) rumors concerning Archuleta’s gender.

No one dared.

PS- The below is simply wrong and I would like an apology!!!! and would like the seeking alpha references put back in place -  thank you

The source used by the article was a press release from Pasternak‎'s lawyers. If we have the comment carried by reliable sources third party sources, then perhaps. But WP:BLP: """"Unsourced or poorly sourced contentious material about living persons—whether the material is negative, positive, or just questionable—should be removed immediately """" (emph added).  The Red Pen of Doom 
I was agreeing with your removal, so you don't have to justify it to me, but you're still wrong about who the source was from. It wasn't from his lawyers. It was from seeking alpha, and you summarized the edit as """"After Knight Trading: a press release from Pasternak's lawyers is not valid source for WP:PEACOCK language"""". I think you just didn't notice the reference with the seeking alpha site before the reference with the law firm site. 
Also, it is not an explicit policy to remove all sources that come from a client's law firm, particularly when they state facts about the disposition of a case. WP:RS does not indicate party-affiliated sources cannot be moved. In fact, it provides explicit guidelines for when its inclusion is appropriate (WP:SELFPUB). Also, the WP:BLP policy has two parts for removal of facts from a BLP: 1) the fact has to be unsourced or poorly sourced, and 2) the source must not be """"written by the subject of the BLP"""". In this case, it was written by [presumably] his lawyers. Either his lawyers stand in his shoes, and so it fails #1 (because it's poorly sourced by virtue of not being sufficiently second-party, a contention which isn't cut and dried) but meets #2 (because it's written by his represenatatives), or it doesn't fail #1 but does fail #2 (a strange place to be).

Hi, John
Regarding your recent message about """"Naked"""", my edit is based on the character's arguable status as an anti-hero.

 User:Slrubenstein and other's falsifying and defamatory edits 

User:Slrubenstein who obviously does not like the word 'theory' (and didn't like the article from the beginning) has repeatedly edited the article adding falsifying terms like 'proposal' instead. Nowhere does Carotta """"propose"""" or """"claim"""" anything. Already in the Introit of his book Jesus was Caesar it is clearly stated that: To anticipate the result: Jesus proves to be Divus Iulius, the deified Caesar, passed down in tradition. The word he uses for this finding is 'disclosure'. So it is wrong to write he 'proposes' or 'claims'. 'Theory' was therefore the best compromise, but the respectable User:Slrubenstein and other distorters don't like that. It should be noted here that User:Slrubenstein has not bothered to explain and discuss on this talk page why he egomaniacally altered the status quo and threatened other users who maintained 'theory' with blockage which was later carried out. He has not answered the questions raised by someone above concerning his problems with this article either.

Now this excellent User:Slrubenstein has even gone so far as to """"protect"""" (i.e. block, prevent editing) the article altogether. I think everyone involved in this or just reading here should seriously ask themselves whether User:Slrubenstein who canvassed against the article, voted for stong delete and most emphatically defamed the author as """"crackpot"""" (this might be actionable), is the right person to further work on this article let alone be an admin in control of it.

User:Rbreen who also voted for strong delete and who has already been convicted of lying and destorting scholarly statements above, now thinks he is the appropriate authority to judge on Carotta's undeniable and never before denied classical scholarship. He obviously knows better than reputable scholars like Piñero, Canfora, Kavoukopoulos, Simon and others. Here's your typical Wikipedia editor.

Nothing new can be said of User:Iblardi either. He helps wherever he can to degrade the article and defame its subject.

User:EALacey is not even capable (or is he not willing?) to correctly translate the word """"Wissenschaftsparodie"""" into English. The correct translation is """"science parody"""". Another typical WP editor, it seems.

Dear Aucaman, I was a bystander during last few months watching your edits and other Kurdish wikipedians' edits  and associated discussions,  without interfereing. I have been asked previously to give my vote on the disputes. I voted and I take the responsibility for it. If you read my comments on the same page, you see that I only asked generally all Kurdish wikipedians to revise their view, without mentioning any specific point about you. To me the story was over. However I have been asked again to enter a similar discussion. As I said I was reluctant to continue in this way. I do agree generally with Mani and Zereshk and I think we have very similar viewpoints. I also have no doubt that four Kurdish wikipedians that have been accused of breaking wikipedia policies, they actually did so. And I have no doubt that they are attacking persian pages. About Cyrus, I read also your response which is again unacceptable for me. The guy is a symbol of an ethnic group and a holy figure in Bible. I suggest you not to burn flag of any nation. We should be very careful when we are criticizing respectable figures of different nations or religious groups. National heros, prophets, Gods etc are things that we should comment very carefully on them. Besides, you are by no means an expert on these issues. About your alleged ethnicity, it is not important whether you are Persian or Kurd, Iranian or Russian. You need to revise your views. If you were persian, you would need an even more extensive revision. This is only a suggestion and my personal viewpoint.

"""

Thanks for your comments.  You asked, """"Why single out RCOG""""?  That would be because the present article is about RCOG.

You asked, """"would you described these as pro-choice advocacy groups""""?  Please observe that my edit to this article said that RCOG took a """"pro-choice position"""" about a particular issue.  That is different from saying that RCOG is a """"pro-choice advocacy group.""""  KillerChihuahua pointed out that difference here.

I am not trying to avoid your question about the BMA, though it's not relevant in connection with the present article.  Yes, I would personally view the BMA as a pro-choice advocacy group.  After all, the report to which you refer states that, """"the BMA does not start off from a neutral position in this debate....the BMA has repeatedly since the 1970s agreed [sic] policy statements supporting the Abortion Act ... and calling for the legislation to be extended to Northern Ireland.""""

I admit that it is hypothetically possible that opposition to reducing abortion time limits might be motivated by concerns about late diagnosis of fetal abnormalities.  As you know, such abortions account for a very tiny fractions of abortions, but you're correct that concern about such situations could hypothetically cause someone to block a general reduction in time limits.

However, RCOG has said it is pro-choice, explicitly supporting """"rights of women to exercise personal choice.""""  RCOG has not only opposed reductions in abortion time limits, but has also sought to """"make abortions easier and faster.""""  It therefore would seem very odd to contend that RCOG has never taken any pro-choice positions. """,0.0

"""

I've got to say, I've read you """"pacafistic"""" rules, seen your idea of """"logic"""", and have heard tales of your """"justification"""" and I just have to say:

I have this to say on my behavior:
I'm a perfectly reasonable person when it comes to arguements, even when they are against my favor. I change subjects, help the people with simple little details they might have gotten wrong, ask them for proper information that I might use against them, basically anything a scatter brainer would do.

I let people have their ways for a little while just to experiment with how it turns out, I try to help BOTH OF US come out on top, I treat both equelly, and I don't get angry when someone yells in my face.

Why should I? They are angry first so I know they are suffering enough and would only poke at them some more just to annoy them (sound fimiliar?) I give them their space though I would still do what I did/do to annoy them. Except, I do it without coming into contact with them (as they would do to me) which I know we'd both appreciate.

I keep the sitch isolated someone else doesn'tblow the entire thing out of proportion before me and that person can resolve the matter only with each other which is inevitable. Others can't resolve the problem, only make it bigger and more serious for either 1 or both. see below.

If they ever try to apologize I tell them not to→ because I wouldn't→ because I have no reason to→ because we shouldn't have been in a scrabble no if ands or buts about it. Conflict is stupid. Almost (but not quite) as stupid as the species that create/embrace it. Leave the creatures space to realize this and you will have peace once more until the next pointless bicker and inevitable resolve.

Now, I have this to say about the """"good"""" people of wikipedia:
Wow.
There sure aren't a lot of you. I wonder why... You've seen many cases and classes of human behavior and traits, you (think) you know what to expect. Well you have most of it down. But you went wrong at a few turns:
1. You (blindly) follow invalid rules and principles that completely misinterpret the act and are constantly showing how much shit they're full of.

2. You think you got """"human psychology"""" in the bag and have tried to play from this to class your principles into rules but your system is far outdated and very inhumane.

3. You don't want to and try not to link yourselves and articles with POV(point of views) but little have you realized your entire system thrives apon it. 
You take sides in arguments between users based solely on what YOU think is most right based apon how YOU have been taught what is right. You are NO ONE to interpret what """"mad"""", """"kind"""", """"eccentric"""", ect. is. Just another group of the bunch and they all think seperately on subjects or else we'd look and be exactly the same. And you don't want that. 
And don't you tell me to calm down, I get just the opposite when people try to make me look crazy that way, and it certainly isn't any diffen't with Bots. 

4. Most importantly, you robots are full of shit:
You take leaders/favorites→ who take favorites→ who put up with your shit like its the right thing to do because they don't knowwhat else to do. Sickening.

2a. You abuse your power instead of embracing it's enlightenment.
Don't you get it?! He wasn't going to block me himself because he wanted to toy with me. He knew I knew he was higher than me and could just as easily waved a hand and blocked me himself. But he didn't. He wanted to add insult to injury. 
You think people want to have someone powerful to look up to? NO! They want to be someone powerful so they can feel embraced/in. 
We all want what we shouldn't have. 
Unfortunately, there are some of us who already have what we shouldn't have.

5. How you go about it is the wrong way. 
Some things people must learn for themselves. You have a problem, try relying on yourself and no one else to resolve.  
If some people are fighting with each other over the internet just sit back and let them/butt out and leave them to their bickering. Sooner or later they will stop arguing of their own account/or reasoning. Or they may even just """"stop"""". BUT if someone bigger than both of them butts in and takes a side however they see fit, things will get much worse.

I'll let you know whether you care or not...:

TheShadowCrow = OWNED. OWNED AND DESTROYED.

The only query I have is that Boxing News uses a hyphen in the new weight divisions; """"light-welterweight"""" etc. Some boxing books type them they same way also.

TheShadowCrow's argument for the WBC not using caps was that it's not an English speaking org, when his example, the diabolical WBA, isn't either. What an absolute idiot.

TheShadowTard comes along making a complete mess of these records and pages, then after I revert his clumsy edits, he comes sniveling to the admins' talk pages claiming it's ME who's attacking the pages. What a complete and utter lying hypocritical spastic. He knows nothing about boxing.

If you know what's good for you, and for wikipedia, you'll all realize your embarrassing errors and revert every bit of vandalism you've all done in making a complete mess of the following boxing pages;

Hi JayJay. I accepted and declining these requests based on the general convention of WP:FMV/W. I renamed some, but others I declined because of this convention. Files are not renamed typically because another title may look slightly nicer, mainly on the basis that most image names are not viewed or important to the encyclopedia. For example, a file named """"File:WikipediansTakesNewYork'07.jpg"""" seems to already be fine based on the convention and should not be renamed to """"File:Wikipedians Takes New York'07.jpg"""" to make it beautiful and more appealing or to make it uniform with other related files.

"The Write-off
Not sure how this should be denoted, but the Write-off was actually originally the Samoan drop from 1991 to early 1992. Then he started using that clothesline for his finisher, which they gave the Write-off name to (much like the Impaler name being used for multiple moves). Then later in WCW, he started using the Samoan drop for his finisher again, which they gave the Stock Market Crash name.

"Does really need a Rewrite
I want to take up the points about Hegel and dialectical materialism: 

How is Marxism considered to be at odds with Darwinism? In some Fascistic sense maybe? Marxism is supposed to be about an economic-social science; Darwin about biological science. Marxist teleology is as much political stance as it is analytic, if it even is analytic at all. In fact Marx's precise invocation of Hegel was in order to expunge the latter's idealist teleology and his focus on 'identity' (hence Marx's book 'the Poverty of Philosophy), and then to take synthetic (dialectical) method and apply it to material history. This current article is not only incomplete and limited in its discussion of teleology, but misleading about other topics as well. There is a debate to be had about Marxism and teleology, but this has not been written here.",0.0

""":::::::BTW, I should note that the Little papers contain that subsection of work that comments on the use of SIMS to support nuclear heavy metal transmutation that I tried to include in the 'Criticisms' section of the CF Wiki article, and which Pcarbonn block deleted.  

I have to plead guilty about putting technical discussions on these pages, but that was brought about because Pcarbonn wanted to argue every detail I tried to add.  Some discussion was necessary anyway because I assumed the article should be written for an 'average' user not familiar with the field, and some of the quoted comments needed some explaining for those readers.  

In agreement with the comments above, the article always was too biased towards the 'reality' of cold fusion, and I tried to make it less so, with the result that I was opposed at every step by Pcarbonn.  The general state of affairs regarding cold fusion today, as observed by myself as a worker in the field of the materials claimed to show CF, is that the average scientist thinks the issue was setled c. 1994, with CF being declared 'bad science' (or pathological or pseudoscience, they don't tend to distinguish between these various terms).  Almost universally (including me), these scientists when presented with current CF papers or statements say """"What? I thought that was over.""""  A very few are aware it is not, most of them are somewhat incensed that CF is NOT dead, and, at this point, only one (me) has actually studied the field and published conventional explanations (the other, W. B. Clarke, passed away).  This situation has allowed the CF die-hards to experience a resurgence of their view in the popular press, since not enough informed scientists are available to stop them (which is not a nefarious plot, they just do lousy science and rarely make it through a good peer review) and they actively suppress mention of the outstanding criticisms of their work.  Thus we have the recent book published via the ACS.

"""== Lenin in England ==

Following Lenin's death many streets in the strongly socialist (communist?) mining villages in the North East of England were changed to the names of Lenin and other communist leaders. See: http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&hl;=en&q;=DH9+6PA&om;=1 or Chopwell. Is this worthy of a mention in this article?

I think that is very interesting, and worth mentioning, especially since England is a western country.  

I agree. It is interesting that those actions were taken. It would be interesting to include the question of why.

 errata note 
The main article refers to a decision to execute the Tsar and family in August 1918. They were executed purportedly in Yekaterinburg the night of July 17-18 1918   the date of the discussion in the main article is in error (or is an old calendar form reference).

 Deleted material
""""Historical research, especially after the fall of Communism opened the Communist achieves, has shown many negative aspects of Lenin's regime. From the Black Book of Communism (Using the Julian calender): The October revolution was on October 25. The Communists started closing down independent newspaper and radio stations the day after (p. 54). On November 13, on order was sent out that all who were suspected being an """"enemy of the people"""" should be imprisoned (p. 55). Starting in January 1918, war prisoners were being tortured and killed on a large scale (p. 60-61). Starting in May, food was being """"requisitioned"""" from the peasants (p. 66). Also in May, several working-class demonstrations were bloodily suppressed (p. 68). There were around 110 peasants uprisings in July and August (p. 67). In June 1918, the Cheka already had 12,000 members (p. 68).  On the 9 and 10 of August, Lenin sent out telegrams ordering mass executions, deportations, and concentration camps. (p. 72-73). Trotsky also supported starting concentration camps (p. 63). 

After the assassination attempt on Lenin and the succesful assassination of Cheka leader Moisei Uritsky on the same day, Lenin and the other Bolshevik leaders decided to respond with overwhelming force, both as retribution and as a deterrent for any similar future attempts. This led to the particularly intensive period of oppression called the Red Terror.

In May 1919, there were 16,000 people in labor camp based on the old Tsarist katorga labor camps, in September 1921 there were more than 70,000 (p. 80). There were large scale rapes of """"bourgeoisie women"""" documented in 1920 (p. 105). In total, 50,000-200,000 summary executions of """"class enemies"""" occurred during Lenin regime.

During Russian Civil War, Lenin started """"requisitioning"""" supplies  from the peasantry for little or nothing in exchange. This led peasants to drastically reduce their crop production. In retaliation,  Lenin ordered the seizure of the food peasants had grown for their own subsistence and their seed grain. The Cheka and the army  began by shooting hostages, and ended by waging a second full-scale civil war against the peasantry. The food requisitioning are documented on p. 97 and p 120-121. The war on the peasantry, including the use of poison gas, death camps, and deportations are documented on p. 92-97 and p. 116-118. In 1920 Lenin ordered increased emphasis on the food requisitioning from the peasantry, at the same time that the Cheka gave detailed reports about the large scale famine (p. 121). The long war and a drought in 1921 also contributed to the famine. Finally, Lenin allowed relief organizations to bring aid but later had most of the Russian members organizing the aid liquidated. Foreign relief organizations suspended aid when it was revealed that the Soviet Union preferred to sell food abroad in order to get hard currency rather than feed its starving people. Estimates on the deaths from this famine are between 3 and 10 million. For comparison, the worst crop failure of late tsarist Russia, in 1892, caused 375,000 to 400,000 deaths .""""

As can be seen, it is extremely well-referenced. However, the communist supporters seems to be extremely afraid to let other know of this and immediately revert all attempts to insert it.  

I have never heard of this before. I highly recommend that you consult with a historian before publishing anything you read off of the internet! Infact, from what I learned in Western Civ, the Red Army didn't kill peasants, but they did consume much of their food (soldiers eat first, civilians second), leading to peas",0.0

Germany 2006

Firstly, soccer/football - who cares.
Secondly, this article is long as australians love their sport.  does it really matter if it is slightly bias?  the simple fact is that with reporting anything, any historical account, there will be bias.  With such an emotive issue such as sport, i think that wikipedia should have a slightly more leniant policy.  I have been repetedly changing this article to say that australia were cruely eliminated, and the over-zealous dickheads on their powertrips keep reverting.  WHY? anyone could agree that getting a penalty in the 95th minute (unfarely) awarded against you, when you had a reasonable chance of winning in extra time is cruel.  

""""NPOV!"""" they cry!  but what really is the harm in this?

 Facts 

I think I'm finally starting to get the hang of this Finding of Fact malarkey, Brad.

The scenario: Bishonen has been focusing her energies for the last few weeks on her attempt to get an editor called Nina Green banned from Wikipedia. When Bishonen realises that Nina Green is indeed going to be banned

She posts to the arbcom page in green text: FoF perfectly normal. Arbcom pages are like little rainbows.
At the end of a talk page post about the green text, Bishonen suddenly decides to refer to it as """"dye"""":  FoF Not at all forced or contrived. Lots of people refer to text as dye. Or if they don't, they should do.
Bishonen ends her post with  """"Green dye!"""" which reads as """"Green die!"""": Fof Pure coincidence. Nina Green couldn't have been further from Bishonen's mind when she wrote """"Green dye!"""". Bishonen hadn't though of Nina Green for at least 30 seconds.

FOF: This entire sequence events: Bishonen wants Nina banned, gets what she wants, posts in green text, decides to call text """"dye"""", and ends her post for no apparent reason with """"Green dye!"""" is just a random bubble of billion-to-one-coincidence. Bishonen could just have easily chosen blue text, and it would have made perfect sense to end her post with """"Blue Pigment!"""".

 Camille Paglia: sex-positive feminist 

Here are the supporting links you asked for, you stupid twit!

http://www.lotl.com/content/paglia.htm

http://www.reference.com/browse/wiki/Sex-positive_feminism

If you are too lazy and full of yourself to read them in their entirety then I will just post the relevant sections here:

Camille Paglia: """"On the other hand I’ve been saying in public for five years ago, as someone who’s endorsed prostitutes and strippers and that whole extreme of sex-positive experience, that I’m concerned about the effect on young people – people growing up from 8, 10, 14 in a climate where it’s gone to the opposite direction. I’m already out there concerned about this so I’m really outraged to be stereotyped in that way by her because I am a career teacher and yes, when you have a situation where commercialised sex is being pushed without a true eroticism…I’ve been saying this for years, that we have got to a point of meaningless exhibitionism without real eroticism. I’m for eroticism."""" 

Camille Paglia is a major American social critic. Paglia's academic writing focuses on the role of vibrant dangerous sexuality in human history. Paglia's key importance to sex-positive feminism is not only her writings on sex, but her advocacy of """"traditional"""" values like canon texts. Paglia is somewhat of an intellectual enigma, a conservative and academic feminist, who revels in low and high culture alike and celebrates sexualities disapproved of by mainstream Western culture. Paglia has, in many ways, presented a """"respectable"""" face for pro-sex feminism to the world at large.""",0.14285714285714285

None: Beefart replies

Thanks for you comments. Few take the time to discuss grammar on Wikipedia and it shows in many articles. I disagree with you about 'none'. The word comes from the Old Norse ne an, which means, literally """"no one"""". In my view, to get the sense of any usage of 'none' we must expand it in our minds to """"no one"""". It is impossible to say """"no one are dinosaurs"""". It has to be """"no one is a dinosaur"""". Here are two examples from the OED: (E.J. Howard): Except for her eyes, none of her features was remarkable. (P. Rose): People sought her... but none was a companion. HOWEVER, the plot thickens, because the OED also gives this example from Graham Greene, who is highly regarded as a writer: None of our wives are invited. This flies in the face of the first two examples and suggests that the OED has given up the fight. Maybe I ought to as well ) ). There are of course some situations where expanding """"none"""" to """"no one"""" does not make any sense as either a singular or a plural. (e.g. None of the increase is due to...). Here the best we can hope for is to propose that """"none"""" is a synonym for """"nothing"""". I personally try to avoid expressions such as """"None of the increase"""" and would be inclined to write """"No part of the increase""""... """,0.0

Each-uisge
This article needs to be more careful when the sources are actually discussing the Each-uisge and not kelpie as such. In a number of instance, the source cited (e.g. Lewis Spence) explicity qualifies their statement as being abut the """"water horse (each-uisge) as distinct from kelpie"""", and yet the article assigns the attributes to the """"kelpie"""". I have tagged some of those relating to the Varner issue as  which shows up as [not in citation given (See discussion.)] in the article.

You're arguing from the rather naive false premise that the kelpie, each-uisge and water horse are in fact three different entities, a distinction not universally applied, as the article explains.

Dude, sorry for the rough language, but you are one fucking dumbass idiot. Everything I type is extremely intelligible and free-flowing, if you will, yet you seem to interpret it WAY differently than it is obviously stated. My sentence, """"You seem to think that this is some sort of """"battle of the dialects"""" (lol), and seem to think that this is what I seem to think (now, that's redundant!) as well, but as I've CLEARLY stated, this is not so"""", makes perfect sense and only an idiot would not understand it. I wrote it redundantly to prove a point, not because I lack verbal skills. The point being, that you are an idiot and you can't understand the symbolic (or even literal) nature of my posts, and you interpret it into something that somehow benefits you and your cozy little world view. Ok, this will be the 100TH time I've had to clear something up for you, but let me tell you what this sentence means:

You seem to think this is a """"battle of the dialects"""". At the same time, you assume I am thinking the same thing. However, I DO NOT think of this as a """"battle of the dialects"""" at all, I think of it as a LOGICAL consensus that needs to replace the current one.

If you discerned something other than this, than you are retarded, hands down. I can't understand why you make all these radical interpretations, especially when most of my words are plainly visible. I am in NO WAY contradicting myself here, and if you can't understand this, then I am in NO WAY going to argue with the mentally retarded, for the guilt would prevent me from having peace of mind for quite some time.

"It was; the Shakespeare question was the one I was not replying to. But to answer your subsequent question, I care because it shows the development process of the play. Taking this hypothetical Shakespeare scenario, it would tell us about his writing process, and perhaps a little of the politics of theatre in his era. Was it delayed because of writer's block? Were elements of the play changed from the way he envisaged/first drew it out because of that? How did it change the theme, climax, or emotion of the show? Was it delayed because the people in power (ie. the theatre owners) disagreed with the play he had created (imagine their reaction if it centred around a homosexual relationship back in that day!)? Or was it perhaps the actors who disagreed with the roles they had to take on? Again that leads us into how Shakespeare worked around the writing problems so that the play could, eventually, go forwards. Or perhaps he had financial issues and that delayed aspects of production. I am not a fan of Billy Shakespeare, but I would find any and all of that information to be most interesing. I would counter that it is, in fact, essential information for the article.

Without corroboration from the translators themselves or the publisher the list is inarguably speculative: The American Heritage Dictionary defines """"speculate"""": To engage in a course of reasoning often based on inconclusive evidence.

I do agree with you, KimvdLinde, on ClothesFree being unacceptable.  Worse than being commercial, to me, is that it is a fad.  It's also saying what the movement is AGAINST instead of what it's FOR. It's also a euphemism for people too prudish to say out loud NUDE or NUDITY.
But then naturism and FKK are euphemisms, too, which encylopedias should avoid.  That's why, even though culturally I fit in more with """"naturists"""", I prefer the word nudist.  But I don't want to try to force the heading """"Nudism"""", by itself, on an unwilling group of Wikipedians.
The near perfect solution is the heading Social nudity or Nudity, social, isn't it?  Not a euphemism.  Even though it's not part of everyday speech, everyone instantly understands it, even quicker than they understand """"Citrus fruit"""".  My second choice would be Nudism, naturism, public nudity, and related practices, but that's a bit awkward.  """,0.0

"I hate Season 4. If there's one thing I hate more than that, it's Paul Tibbit himself! 

Paul Tibbit is a fucking-ass little piece of smelly donkey shit that raped SpongeBob rock-hard!!! 
I hope Paul Tibbit gets fucking cancer and burns in hell!
PAUL TIBBIT IS A WEED-SMOKING BASTARD WHO COMPLETELY FUCKED UP SPONGEBOB!!!!
SpongeBob is a pile of crap now. I don't think I've ever hated a person more than I hate Paul Tibbit. Him and his piss-poor animation skills.
Yeh Tibbit is SUCH A HOMO!!!!
I hope he fucking dies!
What the motherfucking hell is up with people these days? Nick's people obviously smoked lots and LOTS of crack in 2004!
I love Old SPongeBob. New SpongeBob. I don't blame SB. I blame FUCKING PAUL TIBBIT!!!!  SCREW YOU PAUL!!!!
Thanks to that man-hag SpongeBob is completely f++ked up. 

Now, all Nick Studios cares about is money! And i Mean ONLY MONEY!!! They can do an episode where SpongeBob fucking laughs like a fucking pedophile for 20 minutes straight and NOT CARE AT ALL!!! All these people give a tinker's damn about is money, ratings, and fucking fame and fortune. These guys are like celebrities in disgize! They try hard yet put so little effort into their shows JUST to make a quick damned buck! The new episodes drive me nuts! Like Paul Tibbit even HAS any!!!> If I ever meet Paul in real life I swear to neptune I will cut off his large, hairy ball sack tare out his skull and feast on his insides for Thanksgiving!!!!

Nick's people these days are obviously on tons of marijuana! These drunk dunces have no idea in hell what cartoon quality is ALL ABOUT! It would've been WAY better if they just slaughtered this crappy series after the movie!!!! Why watch this shit anymore when Paul Tibbit DESTROYED SPONGEBOB!!!!!! Little do I understand the appeal of the new SpongeBob. I can't believe Paul Tibbit can actually get away with screwing around with a phenominal TV show like he's on freaking cocaine or something! P. Tibbit should be on trial and should get the death penalty is he's considered guilty.

 RM text from Criticism section 

I have been bold enough to remove the following text from the Criticism section: """"In 1944, Tito signed a the decree that ordered the government confiscation of all property, without compensation, of Yugoslavia’s ethnic Germans” [73] and “an additional law, promulgated in Belgrade on February 6, 1945, cancelled the Yugoslav citizenship of the country’s ethnic Germans” [74].
Reasoning: 
1) It's culled directly from a text written by Sunić for the IHR here; 
2) As we have seen previously with other parts of the Criticism section, it makes a complete dog's breakfast of the facts. There was no """"additional law"""". The AVNOJ decree of 21 Nov 1944 was passed into law by the Belgrade decision of 6 Feb 1945. It was the same thing. If you are interested, what the AVNOJ decision actually said was this: """"‘Decision on the transition of enemy property into state ownership, on state administration over the property of absent persons, and on sequestration of property forcibly appropriated by occupation authorities’. Article 1 of the mentioned decision states precisely the status of ethnic Germans: """"To be transferred into state ownership on the day this Decision becomes effective: 1. All property of the German Reich and its citizens situated on the territory of Yugoslavia; 2. All property owned by persons of German nationality, with the exception of those Germans who were members of the National Liberation Army and Yugoslav partisan formations, or are citizens of a neutral country who displayed no animosity during enemy occupation; 3. All property of war criminals and their accomplices, with no regard to nationality...."""". Full details can be found here; 
3) It's untrue that Nov 44 decree/Feb 45 law """"cancelled the Yugoslav citizenship of the country’s ethnic Germans"""" - this happened later, in the summer of 1945, through their loss of voting rights. Specifically, the Provisional Plenary Assembly of the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia passed a citizenship law on 23 August 1945 which stipulated in article 16 that members of those nationalities “whose states had taken part in the war against the peoples of the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia, and who, during or before the war, by disloyal  behaviour, had violated the national and public interests of the peoples of the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia, and hence their duty as citizens thereof”, could be deprived of their Yugoslavian citizenship - it's here;

Shri Prashant Bhushan was also party to this and the issue has been conclusively settled by the Hon’ble court, vide its judgment on May 23, 2011.
8. CAG Issue
Response
At present the CAG has no authority to audit the accounts of private companies in view of the clear provisions contained under Article 149 of the Constitution of India.
The various provisions of the CAG Act, 1971, clearly set out the duties and powers of the CAG are with respect to audit of accounts of Union States and Government Companies / Corporations. These powers do not extend to private companies.
Subsequent to transfer of management control to discoms in 2002, CAG categorically confirmed stating that from July 1, 2002, discoms are not government companies under Section 617 of the companies Act, 1956.
DERC itself, in its tariff order of 28.05.09, had observed that the private discoms being a company, incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956, presently there is no such provision of CAG audit in respect to private companies.

 Kindly please stop lying if you wish me to stop pointing out your lies. It's very rude and disrespectful when I spend my time citing verifiable and reliable sources and you just lie outright, nevermind content, but even on just simply what's happening here, and here's an example of just how you just now did it before requesting that I stop calling you """"liars""""; from Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8, I quote your statement and my reply to it:

 QUOTED: """"I hope that now since all editors have reached a consensus on the article, and have tried to explain you in clearest possible words the difference between numeral symbols and numeral system, you would play a more constructive role. Thanks.   

 QUOTED: Why are you lying again here? yes, lying! As you had been doing for quite some time now and as I have pointed out. The dictionary defines a lie as """"1. A false statement deliberately presented as being true; a falsehood. 2. Something meant to deceive or give a wrong impression."""" First of all, """"all editors have reached a consensus on the article"""" is a demonstrable false statement that you should know is not true and that we're having this exchange here is evidence enough that it isn't, nevermind others. Second, here's your other BIG lie, you say others """"have tried to explain you in clearest possible words the difference between numeral symbols and numeral system"""", Oh really? why don't you tell everyone here that it is I who made the clearest distinction and as far as I remember and see on the page I was the first to make it between numeral symbols and numeral system, and you should know because you have been around. I clearly distinguished in my first post between the Arabic Numerals (1, 2, 3, 4...) and the Hindu-Arabic Numeral system in a paraphragh that begins with """"- For a start,"""" Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#RFC_2 and you should especially know, not just because youhave been around, but also because what you quoted above happens to be just the paragraph under it!  And again I made the distinction in """"the clearest possible words"""" when I proposed here, as my first(!) point in an suggested outline,  Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#Suggested_outline.2C_please_consider_and_discuss """"differentiate a specific numeral script (eg, Arabic Western, Arabic Eastern, Devanagari) from the numeral system (ie, Indian-Arabic, which includes many numerals scripts), the rest of the article should maintain this, it should also keep in mind what the readers may have searched for when looking up this article and cater for those needs (eg, is the reader looking up the Arabic Western numerals script or the Indian-Arabic Numeral system?)"""", and then again zocky, who prefers my version and is against yours, made the same disctinction Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#What_this_page_is_about.

 that section right there. The """"As a result of such dramatic situation ..."""" you make it sound like it was because of Israel the mutual defence agreement was signed. Even in King Hussein's own book and through historical records its pretty clear jordan went to war not because of a threat of israel winning, but a threat that egypt and syria would win sidelining jordan big time.

At any rate i think it would be better not to context why the wars started etc. Focus on battles, etc. Most of the israeli incursions were also due to Israels concept of if Palestinian guerrillas attack to hit back at the arab militaries instead.

Ahhhh, I see that Wigdor, er, I mean, User#24.168.66.27, is trying to worm his way back into this surrealism article again.  Stirling, you might want to check the logs to see how Wigdor was previously removed from the article.  Wigdor is nothing but an emerging artist who thinks he's the next Salvador Dali.  

Keith, er, I mean, User#24.168.66.27, I have my messages saved as text in a separate file, so if you delete my posts, then I will simply reinsert them.  You can't bury the truth.   16:51, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)

User#24.168.66.27, Please don't delete my posts.  That is very rude.

The following was deleted by user#24.168.66.27 this morning.  Why would he delete this post, I wonder:

If anyone is curious, in the interests of creating a NPOV article about surrealism, it should be noticed that both user#63.169.104.2 and user#24.168.66.27 were the main users interested in pushing the Keith Wigdor article forward. If you have any doubts, then check the discussion page for that article.
    
It wasn't long ago that all references to """"Keith Wigdor"""" were removed from this """"surrealism"""" article. This removal occured because of Wigdor's total unimportance to the surrealist movement, for the simple reason that Keith Wigdor is, at best, an emerging digital artist who fancies himself as a being a surrealist, and who has many times attempted to pose as a surrealist. Needless to say, many of the english-speaking surrealist groups listed on this page know about him and refuse to have anything to do with him. Keith Wigdor appears again and again to disrupt all things genuinely surrealist.  
 
It is also interesting to note, if you check the discussion archives of this """"surrealism"""" article, that these same 2 users were also involved with promoting Keith Wigdor as a surrealist, in this very article. Also, if you look at some of the recent, belligerent, trollish, thike-ish posts of these 2 users, it shouldn't be unreasonable to suspect that perhaps both of these 2 IP numbers are being used by Keith Wigdor.

For the 2 no-name users mentioned here, who are strongly associated with or strongly correlated with the antics of Keith Wigdor, it is difficult to imagine that their efforts in building this wiki article will be anything but disruptive and manipulative in the long run. Please treat these 2 users with extreme caution, for they are one and the same, and also happen to be Keith Wigdor, who is playing a sock-puppet game.  22:10, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)""",0.0

 Withdrawn charges 

The London Free press also reported that his charges were withdrawn silently. Now from the perspective of a normal criminal process, this usually means the police had a weak case. The fact that the police were gung-ho about this case may also suggest that the police had no case at all (judging by the seemingly high-profile aspect to this case). In other words, Homeontherange's addition of that information is a pretty clear sign that the information is being added in order to disparage James Scott Richardson.

What is my point of reference? Well. When I added information to Alex Kulbashian and Richard Warman about a Canadian Human Rights Commission complaint file by Alex against Richard, Homeontherange removed the information stating that the complaint could have been filed, however it wasn't serious enough to because there was no evidence the Commissioner signed off on it. Now, getting back to this case, the crown attorney and/or withdrew the charges because there was no prospect for conviction.

To Homeontherange: If you are going to have double standards in """"enforcing"""" wikipedia's criteria for information posted in articles, then that shows your political motivation behind your edits and the way you handle your """"administrative"""" tasks. That would be classified as Administrator Abuse Wikipedia:Administrators#Administrator_abuse.

Killer, I'm sorry that you have misread my unblock request. If you re-read it you will see that my use of """"pop-eyed chihuahua"""" there refers specifically, accurately and unequivocally to the dog displayed on your user page and not to you. I cited it to explain to why I used that imagery in the WP:PA, as otherwise it would appear inexplicably random. The explanation was not, as you seem to think, offered in mitigation. Indeed my original unblock request, which I condensed at the request of admin Hersfold, stated: 

The following will help the reviewing admin(s) to understand what otherwise would appear to be a random choice of metaphors.[...] Killer has a picture of a pop-eyed chihuahua dog on her user page,  captioned “I look like this”; and she is in the habit of referring to herself, in her sysopping summaries, as a dog   e.g. “Puppy has spoken.” Stupidly I exploited this canine imagery at Killer’s expense.'' 

I edited out that section along with others in an effort to comply with Hersfold's request.

My unblock request in no way implies that it is 'somehow OK to insult' you because you refer to yourself as 'puppy'. It simply explains where the idea for the canine imagery came from. It does not attempt to excuse my using it to insult you.

I have apologised, and still do, for my rude and offensive references to you personally in the WP:PA; and ask that you graciously accept my apology as sincere, which it is.   """,0.14285714285714285

"""A barangay (Filipino: baranggay) is the smallest local government unit in the Philippines and is the Filipino term for a village, district, ward or town. Municipalities and cities are composed of barangays.

Each barangay is headed by a barangay captain (punong barangay) i.e. the district mayor, who leads the barangay council (sangguniang barangay) composed of barangay councilors (kagawad). Every barangay also has a Youth Council (""""Sangguniang Kabataan"""" or """"SK"""") composed of the SK President or Chairman and SK Councilors, who direct the youth-oriented activities, such as basketball leagues and other youth oriented activities, in the barangay.

Historically, a barangay is a relatively small community of around 50 to 100 families. Most villages have only thirty to one hundred houses and the population varies from one hundred to five hundred persons. According to Legazpi, he found communities with twenty to thirty people only. Many coastal villages in the Visayan region consisted of no more than eight to ten houses. The word itself is derived from an ancient Malay boat called a balangay. This connection between community and boat supports certain theories on the history of the pre-colonial Philippines, specifically, that each original coastal “barangay” formed as a result of settlers arriving by boat from other places in Southeast Asia.

Questioning minor 1st paragraph edits?
Re: John Roberts, John Paul Stevens, Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, David Souter, Clarence Thomas, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Samuel Alito, Sandra Day O'Connor
This is a small matter.  I don't understand the reasons for 's recent minor edits of articles about each of the Justices of the Supreme Court.  After some time, there has been no response to inquiries posted on this editor's talk page nor has there been feedback from similar postings on the talk pages of each of the nine articles about a sitting Justice and the one about retired Justice O'Connor.  Rather than simply reverting this """"improvement,"""" I thought it best to solicit comment from others who might be interested. I found your name amongst others at Talk:Supreme Court of the United States.

I'm persuaded that 's strategy of introducing academic honors in the first paragraph is unhelpful in this narrow set of articles  that is, in Wikipedia articles about Justices of the Supreme Court. I think my reasoning might well extend as well to others on the Federal bench.  In each instance, I would question adding this information only in the first paragraph  not elsewhere in the article.  

In support of my view that this edit should be reverted, please consider re-visiting articles written about the following pairs of jurists.
 A1. Benjamin Cardozo
 A2. Learned Hand
 B1. John Marshall Harlan
 B2. John Marshall Harlan II
The question becomes: Would the current version of the Wikipedia article about any one of them  or either pair  be improved by academic credentials in the introductory paragraph?  I think not.

Perhaps it helps to repeat a wry argument Kathleen Sullivan of Stanford Law makes when she suggests that some on the Harvard Law faculty do wonder how Antonin Scalia avoided learning what others have managed to grasp about the processes of judging?  I would hope this anecdote gently illustrates the point. 

Less humorous, but an even stronger argument is the one Clarence Thomas makes when he mentions wanting to return his law degree to Yale.

As you can see, I'm questioning relatively trivial edit; but I hope you agree that this otherwise plausible """"improvement"""" should be removed from introductory paragraphs of ten articles.  If not, why not?

"Is there a higher authority than you that I can appeal to?

Is there some way we can talk over the phone so that I can explain to you (or anyone else you care to nominate) what I am concerned about and why?  I am frustrated by my inability to get to the ground truth in this vexatiously crippling rule-bound system, as it only seems to be able to get to what most editors happen to believe, without providing any reliable functional process for getting past misconceptions into the ground truth.  Science itself provides such a functional process known as the scientific method, but Wikipedia doesn't operate on that paradigm.  Instead it operates on an anachronistic rule-based paradigm that wobbles to what the most dominant Wikipedia editors believe.  When it comes to characterizing living persons, that paradigm is demonstrably fraught with errors that are nigh impossible to fix.

There are famous cases in history when the vast majority of people held laughable misconceptions.  But science is an arduous process, and many dedicated scientists have suffered grievously for having the temerity to displace a popular misconception with a superior theory grounded in evidence and reasoning.

Getting people to honestly question their assumptions and conscientiously examine both their assumptions and the evidence for them is one of the recurring challenges in science education.

As a science educator, it pains me beyond words to observe how badly we have failed to inculcate a scientific mindset into the educable public.",0.0
"""I am removing the following section for two reasons:

""""Some anthropologists and sociologists are critical of the method because it measures personality traits on a basis of its synonymous adjectives in the English language, thus overlooking possible cultural construction of language. That English alone was used in factor analysis also arguably demonstrates an example of ethnocentrism. Furthermore, sociologists are critical that the theory only reinforces stereotypes and ignores social factors that might have lead to traits being present in certain groups of individuals. For instance, while women have a demonstrated tendency towards agreeableness, this is likely true of most subordinated individuals. Tying this trait to women at a psychological level then only reasserts inequalities by implying that differences exist as a matter of human nature rather than as a result of the social construction of gender.""""

1. The information given there is incorrect. I've checked the scientific research to be sure, and English alone was *not* used in factor analysis, and the existence and nature of the Big Five factors has been validated in multiple continents. Here's an excerpt from McCrae & Hofstede's fascinating paper, Personality and Culture Revisited: Linking Traits and Dimensions of Culture (2004):

""""Research in the English-speaking world using the NEO-PI-R established that individual differences in the factors are stable throughout most of the adult life span; that self-reports generally agree with observer ratings; and that the five factors, as well as the more specific traits that define them, are strongly heritable. In the 1990s, researchers around the world began to develop translations 2 of the instrument, making cross-cultural research possible. A series of studies showed that much the same factor structure was found in a wide variety of cultures (McCrae & Costa, 1997), that developmental trends in the mean levels of personality traits between adolescence and later
adulthood appeared to be universal (McCrae et al., 1999), and
that similar gender differences were found among cultures (Costa,
Terracciano, & McCrae, 2001).""""

Here are the relevant citations from the above; if you can find them, I suggest taking a look:

McCrae, R. R., & Costa, P. T., Jr. (1997). Personality trait structure as a human universal. American Psychologist, 52, 509-516.

McCrae, R. R., Costa, P. T., Jr., Lima, M. P., Simões, A., Ostendorf, F., Angleitner, A., et al. (1999). Age differences in personality across the adult life span: Parallels in five cultures. Developmental Psychology, 35, 466-477.

Costa, P. T., Jr., Terracciano, A., &McCrae;, R. R. (2001). Gender differences in personality traits across cultures: Robust and surprising findings. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 81, 322-331.

As a further note in this regard, one group of subordinated individuals - prisoners - show personality profiles with low Agreeableness scores. Teenagers also show lower Agreeableness than adults. So I don't think it's """"likely true of most subordinated individuals"""" that they have high Agreeableness. In point of fact, it appears that Extroversion actually has more to do with social dominance than Agreeableness does. (And men score higher in the Assertiveness sub-scale of Extroversion, incidentally, as given in the last study cited above.)

2. Beyond being incorrect, I don't like the above statement because it demonstrates bias. The fact that psychometric research """"reinforces stereotypes"""" does not show that the research is bad or wrong; instead, it supports the truth to these stereotypes. Whether women are Agreeable because of genetic or environmental reasons is irrelevant to the question of whether Agreeableness is a valid and universal psychomentric construct. And of course while sociologists and anthropologists may be unhappy about these research results, that doesn't change the facts.

Hopefully this explanation is thorough enough to obviate the necessity of future arguments.

Clearly the point is biased in some direction; it is, after all, called criticism. However, it is appreciatable to rework claims rather than remove them entirely, as for example my move to redirect back the bias of your word """"discovered"""", implying a factual truth of the matter, back to the more neutral term identified, and my return of your loaded attempt of beginning the criticism section with """"While the general consensus favoring a five-factor model is strong, there is still dissention.""""

""":Hi there. Thanks for your concern on the matter. I can assure you this has little to nothing to do with """"mathematician vs physicist"""" as you have proposed; it, instead, has everything to do with Linas incompetence. It is univerally acknowledged that a complex function SQUARED can be negative. This is nothing new or exciting: consider f(x) = i if you don't believe me. The square modulus of a wavefunction is what the probability defined in the context of wavefunctions. 

Remarkably, someone who pretends he is so knowledgeable in mathematics and physics - indeed, even stating to me that I do not know Quantum Mechanics and hence should not edit articles - could make such a terrible fumble. Without saying it for effect, his lack of understanding between the square modulus and the square of a complex number if a lack of understanding of day one material: literally, my Complex Analysis book (by Conway, Graduate Texts in Mathematics series) covers it in the first section, and again literally, my mathematical physics course as an undergraduate covered this on the first day of class.

Linas, you are incompetent. People tend to make errors at the periphery of their knowledge. As it turns out, the edge of your knowledge is day one in complex variables. Please refrain from editing articles on quantum mechanics and mathematics. You clearly do not know what you are talking about.

Questions and comments

Ms. Barber wrote: """"In a united effort, the ISSR Licensed Breeders only produce approximately 200 pups per year""""  '''''

Ms. Barber-How many of those puppies were """"produced"""" by your kennel?  What specific health testing do you conduct on your dogs?

You, and those supporting your club/registry, have been respectfully asked for this information numerous times during this discussion yet you continue to ignore these legitimate requests, while appearing rude, insulting, superior-minded, and frankly an entirely offensive and inarticulate representative of this breed you """"founded"""" and the other breeders affiliated with your registry.  I certainly hope other breeders affiliated with your organization do not present themselves to the public in the same way you do, as I can't imagine anyone with any intelligence and self-esteem would be willing to tolerate such unprofessional behavior, much less purchase any puppies/dogs from people who conduct themselves the way you have in this discussion.

You claim a lot, but you provide no independent support for your claims, only your own writings on your own website.  You claim anyone """"producing"""" dogs other than you or your registry are frauds, yet you are unwilling to prove how this is true other than offering some photos YOU have taken of these dogs and your own rantings, as evidence. You claim breeders unaffiliated with you are """"in it for the money"""", yet:

You produce more of these dogs than almost all other breeders combined, through your wholly and co-owned breeding dogs.  Your website (http://www.newzionshilohs.org/upcoming_litters.htm) for this Winter alone, shows you are """"producing"""" ELEVEN litters at New Zion and through co-ownership breedings.  Eleven litters, even conservatively speaking, could easily produce over 100 PUPPIES!  And, you are planning for 20 more litters next Spring and Summer!  You also currently list over 25 stud dogs and over 25 females you are considering for breeding!

You charge a lot of money for each puppy you produce ($900-$2500+).  After the puppy-buyer has paid you for a puppy from a certain litter, you also contractually reserve the right, at your own discretion, to substitute a puppy from another """"compatible"""" (again, based on your own determination) litter and you will not provide a refund if they are do not agree with the """"substitute"""" puppy you decide to offer them.
(see: http://www.newzionshilohs.org/Policies_N_Prices.htm.....""""New Zion reserves the right to substitute any litter of equal/higher value that is compatible with your exact requirements"""").

It appears that, once monies are given are given to you, your contract does not allow for any refund under any circumstances, nor could I find any instances where you contractually assume any financial responsibility whatsoever for any puppies you """"produce"""" who display congenital/hereditary problems requiring resulting astronomical/extensive veterinary fees.
  
You require your puppy-buyers to not only pay you for puppies at the time you """"produce"""" them, but you also require puppy-buyers to sign contracts promising future puppy and breeding rights (for breedable dogs, you require the dog's new owners to either give you some of the puppies that dog produces in the future and/or you require they allow you to use that dog in the future to sire new litters of your own), in order to profit from the dog not only now but also throughout his/her life. 

You have no stated policy on your website page (http://www.newzionshilohs.org/Policies_N_Prices.htm) re: your own personal policy/commitment to rescue and make/find a home for for any of the puppies/dogs you """"produce"""", should they become unwanted, homeless and/or end up in shelters or in abusive situations.

Your """"Policies and Prices"""" make no mention of a contractual requirement by you (with the signed contractual commitment of your puppy-buyers) to spay/neuter their new """"pets"""", in order to reduce overpopulation of this breed and dogs, in general.  I could find nowhere on your website where the horrifying statistics of unwanted/euthanzied dogs in the U.S. (2 million +, including 25% of which are purebred dogs) is responsibly addressed by someone actively promoting and engaged in the proliferation of this explosion.
 
Your website does not list any independent references, such as recommending/governing affiliations (i.e. Better Business Bureau), approval ratings (i.e. OFA, Penn-Hip, CERF), or other professional organizations to which you belong (ie. American Dog Owner's Association, the the Delta Society [therapy], dog training or agility organizations, etc.), only your own dog club(SSDCA), you own dog registry (ISSR), and your own",0.0

"I'm afraid I'm not much help here. My knowledge here is that of an interested lay observer only. With that caveat, I'll answer your two-part question.

First, I'm not aware of a book dedicated on the topic of 1988 uprising or even the late 1980s up to the 1990 election. A meaningful book on the topic should in part contain information based on interviews with those involved from all sides, not just based on the account of the exiles. Given that the political climate has just recently improved, I'm sure such a meaningful book is yet to be written. Now, I still think that the military will not fare well even in a more balanced light. (No excuse for killing your own people, and shutting down the education system for a decade. Talk about a lost generation. Talk about cutting the nose to spite the face!)

Second, yes, I've heard some in the military wanted a Golkar-style arrangement (i.e. institutionalized role of the military in parliament/politics) but I'm not aware of a formal public proposal. I'm not sure if that proposal ever had the support of the top brass of the military. Then again, I can also see DASSK rejecting such an offer in the 1990s. As much as I admire her personal courage and integrity, I always thought she should have been more flexible. She was never a natural politician like her father who was a pragmatic person and actually got things done. Not sure which National Assembly you mean. AFAIK, the military did an about face after the 1990 elections that the elections were not to convene the assembly but to write a new constitution. HTH.",0.0

To answer  and in doing so  as well, I do not take to gaming Wikipedia lightly.  Especially when I find myself involved with those editors doing so? Who's gaming wikipedia? Firstly; Arthur Rubin. Have you looked at the laundry list of violations this """"admin."""" has racked up? Deleting other users posts on talk pages, tag team reverting, blocking, edit warring, being blocked etc. etc. etc. A short review of the section on my talk, brought to me by an IP editor too afraid to use their actual user-account informed me of his nefarious record here on Wikipedia. I refuse to walk into a known hostile article with hostile editors waiting to pounce like Subject Trolls. Who set this precedent of a hostile editing environment? Arthur Rubin, whose repeated rule-busting and counter-productive, antagonistic dancing around the issues leads only to toxic situations like this. I am NOT a push-over. Further, the editors in question,  and  make zero suggestions or concessions, oh but the """"undo"""" button never fails to escape their attention.  How many times do I have to say this? These editors have the same stone-wall tactics and bad attitudes responsible for the grid lock in Washington D.C. where only the people/Wikipeia viewer are/is made to suffer. This is why, people like Arthur Rubin should not be a Wikipedia admin., this is why people like Arthur Rubin should not even so much as be Wikipedians. As of now, I will be writing an email to Wikipedia management and demanding his permanent dismissal and subsequent blocking of his most used IP.

""" (UTC)

This debate is essentially about what can be stated unqualifiedly as fact. The consensus definition of fact is """"something that can be demonstrated to be true"""", in other words, """"something based on empirical evidence"""". I think that most dissenters would acknowledge that their views are not by this definition """"fact"""", that is, they would not claim that their views are """"built on empirical evidence"""". Frankly, the definition of fact is very much linked with the definition of science, as the goal of science is the establishment of fact. Thus, statements about which there is no fact-based debate, such as the roundness of the earth, can be stated as fact. Non-fact-based dissenting views can be stated as dissenting views, preferably in their own articles to avoid confusing the fact-seeking encyclopedia user.
The alternative, as far as I can figure, is to not state anything at all as fact, which would make Wikipedia a useless hellish cauldron of boiling fat. As one who believes that Wikipedia is meant to be an encyclopedia, this isn't a very attractive prospect. If anyone can think of a different way to determine what can be stated as fact, go right on ahead.   07:41, 29 January 2006""",0.0

I would think the problem is that egg-rolls and spring rolls are clearly two different things but the numbers of differences can very.

On the main egg-roll article, there is a citation that links to an article written by no less of an authority than Chinese-American chef Martin Yan.  There Yan details the main difference between the two.  Egg-rolls have eggs as part of the wrapper, along with wheat flour and water.  Spring rolls just have the wheat flour and water. 

This one ingredient different causes several changes.  The inclusion of the eggs causes egg-rolls to be darker, slightly chewer and with a rougher outer texture.  Spring rolls, with the lack of egg, fry up slightly crispier with a lighter color and a smoother outer texture.  All of this is directly from Chef Yan, not myself, so it can be taken as authoritative.

And all that is clear enough.  The problem or confusion if you will, most often centers around the filling and the size.  At this point, we mostly have personal experience.  Your average Chinese restaurant in America is bound to have a dish called an egg-roll.  This egg roll is going to have the wrapper made from egg, wheat flour and water.  It will be filled with assorted vegetables and a protein.  The protein can be shrimp, pork, chicken or a combination of shrimp and pork.  The differences in the protein are often regional, with some areas only having shrimp and/or pork while other areas only having chicken.  The size can also be different as well depending on how thick or thin the cook rolls the egg-roll out.  I've seen egg-rolls thicker than manicotti or as thin as spring rolls.  The only thing uniform is the color and texture as the effects of the egg in the wrapper are consistent.  In addition it might be worth mentioned that egg-rolls are a far more common sight than spring rolls on the menus of such restaurants but that might be somewhat off-topic. 

We could say, as Mr. Colin McLarty writes above, that another key difference is that many consider egg-rolls as having meat (protein) with vegetables as a filling, while spring rolls only have vegetables.  And to be sure, I have never seen spring rolls anywhere in the US with any protein in the filing.  And when you order a egg-roll in a Americanized Chinese restaurant, it will contain some sport of protein.  However, one can find a curious thing in the frozen foods section of America supermarkets everywhere throughout the country.  Vegetable egg-rolls.  They are not spring rolls as they are made with the wrapper that contains egg and from the outside they look just like the egg-rolls that are sold right next to them.  But yet while you can find them in supermarkets coast-to-coast, I personally have yet to see them in any Chinese restaurant. 

Of course, all of this does not touch upon the tendency of Vietnamese restaurants in the US to call Goi cuon """"spring rolls"""".  One can only assume such a decision is to make an ethic menu, without a typical spring roll on it, more appealing non-Asian customers.  Though some restaurants do call Goi cuon """"summer rolls"""" instead.  And I once personally saw a menu for a Thai restaurant that had both typical egg-rolls and typical spring rolls but also offered Goi cuon as well, labeling it as the """"house spring roll""""!

 Power Station Vandalism 

I am writing to question you of your suspected involvement in a vandalism attack on a local power station in Reading, England. We have reason to believe you are the ring leader of a vandal street gang known as the 'Purple Unity and Red Jack's' that are localised to southern Reading. On Thursday 21st April 2011, upon the residents of the area witnessing the attack, in which seven vandals caused costly damage to the structure and it's fences as well as many surrounding trees, a cardboard banner was attached to the fence reading """"Under orders of Gwern"""".

This is not the only occasion in which your Wikipedia account has been referenced. On Saturday January 1st 2011, the same gang was seen attempting to transport themselves onto the Madejski Stadium roof using cannons to release a banner over the East Stand reading """"We will never bow to hatred; we will never fall to society, we will never rest for fear of our mission failing - All Hail Gwern"""". The initial aim failed, they never were able to reach the roof; however, their banner was slung over a nearby house for all to see.

Also, on 12th December 2010, a middle-aged man was seen sprinting away from elderly people with several teenagers following and aiding him. On his shirt, he was revealed to be sporting the words """"Gwern"""". 

Now, we have strong suspicions that you are this Gwern person, and we have every intention of arriving at the truth. We will be in contact if we arrive at any more information. Thankyou for your time.

I think red tape accurately and succinctly communicates the situation you describe, especially given that in a prior version you yourself wrote
Attempts to rectify this situation working through official channels did not work
which it seems to me is the very essence of (extreme) red tape. If you like we can say instead official indifference or unresponsiveness, but I don't see how that better informs the reader.
I also don't see how your wording makes the point you mention re success in decrypting and the importance of that success. Obviously a request for more resources will try to convince the recipient that such will help the writers to better do what they've been tasked to do. To spell out that their desire was """"to achieve the productivity that was possible"""" would be completely superflous  of course that was the goal. And surely no reader needs to be told that better productivity / faster decrypting / etc. meant the entire difference between valuable intelligence and useless retrospective. Your wording doesn't mention any of that stuff anyway.
Further (as I've said before) I also don't see why it matters what specific type of resource was lacking  the important points are: (a) the codebreakers felt that they could not do the best job possible without more resources; (b) Churchill unhesitatingly granted them carte blanche, showing the importance he attached to their work and the breadth of his authority in making such decisions. What doesn't matter is just what it was that was lacking  typists? paperclips? light bulbs?

International Reactions
The trials have been condemned by The European Union, it's individual member nations, and The United States.
Medical experts and scientists also disputed the convictions.

 
United States Senator Richard Lugar, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, vowed to work for the release of the accused. novinite. On September 19, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov vowed to work for the release of the medics on his trip to Libya in November. novinite. U.S. President George W. Bush has said """"I want them free."""" One of Gaddafi's sons has admitted at least some Libyan responsibility. On December 24, 2005, it was announced that Libya, Bulgaria, the EU, and the US had agreed on a fund which may help to resolve the matter. Reuters. Yahoo!

In response to the risk of a new death penalty verdict in the current trial, international opinion has again began to mobilize. In October 2006, several scientific organizations responded with appeals, and The New York Times NY Times. and the journal Nature Nature. published strong editorials calling for a fair trial.

Quid pro quo
Although he concurred with the guilty verdict, Gaddafi proposed releasing the six medics, if quid pro quo:
the convicted Pan Am Flight 103 bomber Megrahi, serving a life sentence in a Scottish jail, were to be released; and
US$2.7 billion compensation were paid to Libya for the care of the HIV-infected patients (the exact sum offered by Libya in compensation for the 270 lives lost in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing).http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=57381
Bulgaria refused to pay any compensation on the grounds that it would be admitting the guilt of the medics. On June 7, 2005, the European Union engaged in negotiations to provide assistance to Libya, but not directly linked to the case of the six medics.http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=57040 On August 18, 2005, Libya recommended that Bulgaria should negotiate on the amount of the payment.http://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory?id=1048104&CMP;=OTC-RSSFeeds0312 The next week, the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly (PACE) delegate visited Libya and saw the medics.http://www.novinite.com/newsletter/print.php?id=51534 On August 31, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Ivaylo Kalfin stated that Bulgaria would send humanitarian aid while not acknowledging the guilt of the medics.http://www.focus-fen.net/index.php?catid=72&ch;=0&newsid;=71374http://www.speroforum.com/site/article.asp?idCategory=33&idsub;=124&id;=1823 On September 8, it was announced that Libya had prepared a list of 40 items (non-monetary) that should be sent as aid and that Bulgaria could supply 24 of them.http://www.focus-fen.net/index.php?focus=hot&hotid;=758

Relief (and protests) over first reprieve
On December 25, 2005, Libya's supreme court overturned death sentences against the Benghazi Six, who had always denied intentionally infecting 426 children with HIV-contaminated blood. 

Bulgarian president Georgi Parvanov said the court ruling """"confirmed our hope that justice in this case will prevail."""" President Parvanov added: """"The unfair death sentences were reversed. …We hope that the swiftness and the effectiveness demonstrated by the Libyan court in the past days will help solve the case as soon as possible.""""

US State Department spokesman, Justin Higgins, described the decision as a """"positive development since it removes the risk of the death penalty being carried out. As we have made clear before, we believe a way should be found to allow the medics to return to their home"""".

The Council of Europe welcomed the decision and said it hoped the new trial will """"comply with the internationally recognised standards of fairnes",0.0

This will also put in perspective the recent inflation of Nobel laureates in the sciences, which is easy to explain: most of the recent laureates had to share the prize while most of the early laureates got a full prize.  The lists of laureates by university or by country must take this into account as well. For example, Glauber (US), Hall (US) and Hänsch (Germany) shared the physics prize of 2005. But we cannot simply add 2.00 points to the US count and 1.0 to the German count. Instead we have to add 0.75 to the US count and 0.25 to the German count (Hänsch and Hall each got only 0.25 of the prize, Glauber got 0.5). Otherwise we'd violate the Nobel Prize conservation law:  The sum of the Nobel Prizes per year is constant; you may divide it among many laureates, but then the laureates necessarily become less outstanding on average.",0.0

 Texas Tech seal images 

I note that you reverted my replacement of Image:TTU Seal.svg, Image:TTUS Seal.svg and Image:TTUHSC Seal.svg with Image:Texas Tech CoA.png in their respective articles.  The reason I replaced them was twofold:

First of all, it simply seems to me that, at least for the TTU and TTUHSC articles (not so sure about TTUS) the Coat of Arms would more accurately reflect the overall visual identity of the institutions in question; according to the visual identity guidelines at , """"[t]he Official Seal and Signature are [...] reserved for use by the Office of the President of Texas Tech University and are used to represent the official business of the university"""", whereas the academic Coat of Arms is intended as a """"unified identity for all academic entities within the Texas Tech University System"""".  Using the Coat of Arms instead of the seals in our articles would also seem to reduce the (admittedly small) chance of them being mistaken for official documents of the university, and complies with the advice (which, while we are not bound by it under fair use, it would seem courteous for use to follow) that """"[t]he Official Seal and Official Signature may be used only for documents and publications that represent official business of Texas Tech University"""" and that """"[d]ocuments that are not official and formal should use the appropriate Academic Signature"""" (i.e. the Coat of Arms).  It also allows us to use a single image for all the articles, not to mention, in my opinion at least, showing the interesting part of the logo more clearly without the distracting border and text around it.

The second, and more significant, reason for the replacement, however, was that, while I'd originally uploaded those SVG seal images in good faith, believing them to be acceptable with U.S. fair use law as well as our policies, upon further reflection I'm not longer as convinced of this as I was.  In particular, while there are reasons for arguing that the SVG versions are not too detailed to pass criterion 3(b), especially given that they're freely available from the TTU web site anyway, I now feel that, regardless of the acceptability of their absolute level of detail, they are nonetheless replaceable by less detailed bitmap images, and therefore fail the non-free content criterion 3(a).

Thus, I no longer believe those images are appropriate for Wikipedia, and do not want myself to be associated with them.  As their uploader, I have the right to delete them; the reason I chose to tag them as orphan instead of deleting them directly is that I wanted to keep them around for a while, in case someone did object to the change, and did not want others to end up tagging them (and warning me about it) while they were there.  That said, I still don't want them to stay around forever with my name in the upload log; if you want to, despite the issues I outlined above, you're free to reupload them (or bitmap versions of them) under a different title, thereby assuming the responsibility of asserting their compliance under our policies and U.S. law.  I no longer want that responsibility.

Oh, and regarding the use of the TTUHSC seal at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center El Paso Campus, I'm pretty sure that blatantly violates our non-free content criterion 8.  It's not like that article really needs (either of) the images, anyway.  —  """,0.0

hey warrens, fuck you too. """"Uncivil manner, means me trying to elaborate on my arguments and getting  revert on revert that's what uncivil means. So yeah your a big winner champ and won't get banned. Asshole. 

Since the vista article contains information about the anti trust situation which, since it seems some people here have got a mouthful of gate's balls, is mislabelled anti trust controversy. Not really a controversy though is it when a court elected by over two hundred million people issues a decision, it'a court ruling, like it or not there's no controversy too that. Otherwise we should renaim the ted bundy trial, to the tend bundy controversy, since any court ruling merits this label. 

Since there's a section on anti trust laws and vista, it's worth noting the recent news that microsoft are going to be paying a hefty daily fine for completely ignoring the court's injuction. And this does have bearing on vista. You can't quote the m.s. pr saying we don't know what they want us to do, it's all questions, or whatever else he mentioned, without an adjunct sentence, of the head official regulating the anti trust actions quoting him too saying that our injuctions are crystal clear yet ms has ignored them for over two years now. 

But of course this has no bearing if this article is supposed to be a showcase for vista.

So like i said, if some fuckers had gone into the trouble of actually discussing any of that instead of reverted every single edit in a hitleric fashion, things would be different.

But for now this stategy of being a hawk on an article I wish to keep in a certain way, and being completely uncivil and rude about it, merits from my part a roayl, fuck y's all, take your mouths off of gate's balls and then we can talk.

Answere:- No I have not supported lotsd of groups. I have only supported the CPW , AWP (formally known as the NCPA). I was never a member of the People's Think Tank Association plus the PTTA never had a president. Plus I have only ever been one person. And that person is Peter Watson. This nazi must have a lot of time on his hands to look for information on me. So I can only come up with only one conclusion and that is simply that this man has no social or sex life. So I can only say on thing """"go get a life man and get a women"""".

Peter was President of the """"People's Think Tank Association"""" based in Warwick, which he says """"split from the Communist Party of Australia just recently and they publish the Caller""""

Answere:- I was never the president of the PTTA. The PTTA was never ever created. The Caller was a fake news paper. As fare as I know it was only ever printed once by some nazi. Since the PTTA was never realy so how cna it split from the CPA. So many questions and not enough answeres. The man just doesn't have a life.

Peter was """"President of the New Communist Party of Australia"""" and """"Chairman of the Central Committee"""" (this is in his Communist International News)

Answere:- I was the president but not the had of the NCPA. I was the chairman of the central commitee. But as you might know the NCPA and the AWP are the same group. The AWP change its name to NCPA but change it's name back soon after remember you stupid nazi.

Peter was """"President of the Communist Party of Warwick""""

Answere:- Only for a short number of times in the hsitory fot he party that I was the presidnet of it.

Peter also says: """"the New Communist Party of Australia (NCPA) , The People Think Tank Association (PTTA) and the Communist Socialist Workers Front (CSWF) did dissolve and absorbed into the Australia First Party (AFP)"""".

Answere:- The Communist Socialist Worker's Front never ever was created and never was real. It just goes to show that nazis just makes things up to help them selvs. The PTTA was never real. If you are aksing why I made the CSWF and the PTTA up well it was just for fun.

Peter has also set up the """"Australian Worker's Party""""

Answere:- This nazi (FairDinkum) is a idiot. I have said this many times that it was started in april was a split from the CPW that changed it's name to NCPA than change it's name back to AWP when it was kicked out fo the AFP. Not only are nazis stupid like FairDinkum but they also don't listen.

I am a Communist and believe in Marxist-Leninism. I am not retarted. Plus I am not troubled person or retarted. I have never said in my life that I was the king of the Communists or the Nazis.

"""== Next Good Article candidate? ==

So what's the next article you want to work up to GA status? I actually LIKE writing footnotes, and finding sources for stuff. I enjoyed finding citations and sources for the stuff in the Horse article last night. Might as well add my services to whatever you're working on next...  | Talk 

Well, given your area of interest, why not American Quarter Horse?  Dlh-Stablelignts has been doing some tremendously good work on Gelding also, and so while the veterinary sections are pretty good, the rest of it could benefit from some additional sourcing, though I did a lot of updating and fixing of what was there originally.  That might be another possibility.  Morgan horse could get there with some SERIOUS work.  Have you looked over the criteria yet?   

 Briefly, I looked them over. I recall that they need lots of citations, in depth and with enough pictures/diagrams to make things easy to understand for the non-initiate. I'm sure there is a lot more. I've got books on the vet or training side of things, but not as many as on horse bloodlines and breed history. You've obviously been working hard on things with the horses, and I figured I'd rather work with you, than have everyone sorta scattered all over working on sixteen different articles. Concentrating on a couple would probably make the work easier and quicker, I would think. Of course, I'm still new at this, but I know my editing is helped when someone else checks over it. Quarter horse might be a bit TOO much, honestly. I'd have to fight hard to not put in all sorts of tidbits on the older horses from before the registry formed... and the history of the controversies behind the registry, and .. well you get the idea. Oddly enough, given my Quarter horse interests, I own Arabians (grins) so I'd love to see the Arabian article make Featured.... but I'm scared to ask how much work that would take! Anyway, now that I've babbled, I'm more than happy to watch you work and help however I can. Certainly don't want to work at cross-purposes.  | Talk 

The internet is my friend on a lot of breed stuff, most """"generic"""" horse books actually are quite poor sources with huge inaccuracies.  The breed registry web sites are often much better (though they aren't above POV, at least four different breeds claim to be the descendants of Bucephalus, which is a wholly unverifiable claim! .  You want an easy job, go to List of horse breeds and take a red link to make a new article.  Most in there are stubs, and need expansion, some are red links that aren't even real breeds (For example, you don't want to see the can of whoopa I open when people start claiming that the """"Egyptian Arabian"""" is a different breed, BTW(grin)) so checking the horse stubs is always a way to find new mischief.  (Somehow I got drug into editing on Marwari horse, don't ask me how.)  I got [{Arabian horse]] pretty much to GA status singlehandedly, but it took awhile, editing it from a disaster of anti-Arabian POV to GA status over a period of several months, learning all the way.  My panic about putting it up for FA (I actually think it's almost there) is more the vandalism patrolling it will entail and the things that the wider world of wiki editors might take issue with (for example, the controversies section, almost all parts of it were inserted to settle some kind of edit war or POV discussion.  It's needed.).  I'm not sure I am ready to put  the energy into watchdogging it so that some idiot doesn't totally screw it up or, worse yet, restart battles that were settled a long time ago.  Equine nutrition is one I started from scratch, and after an initial panic when an admin felt I overdid the copy and paste and slapped a copyviol on it without warning (which gave me a really bad couple of days scrambling to get it finished), I basically had it ready for GA in about a week, with a few contributions from some other editors like

"Proposed move would benefit the wider community (a copy in my talk page). 

Wikipedia is not a dictionary but an encyclopedia, therefore, the content and title name of an article there, necessarily needs to be encyclopedic, not as in the case of dictionaries. The naming of the sweet cannot straightforwardly choose as Rasgulla. However, the naming in Wikipedia appears to be followed only the Oxford dictionaries, as an anglicize name loaned from a foreign country. But the name obviously misspelled there, as the dictionary mentions rasgullā originates in Hindi – so the name to be disambiguated to avoid confusion with Rosogolla for the reasons many reliable English-language sources mentions the sweet name Rosogolla, The Oxford Companion to Sugar and Sweets describes Rosogolla is primarily associated with West Bengal, then Bengal in British India. The fact establishes the origin of the sweet is in Bengal - a part of greater India, not Hindi, in Bengal the sweet is called Rosogolla since its initial usage.  
 
Nevertheless, here rises a question, whether Wikipedia must stick to its current naming when the naming is misleading or inaccurate. 

As per description of Wikipedia, the naming the sweet should be seen as goals, not as rules. Whereas, considering the deleted article Rosogolla's naturalness, consistency, prevalence in many reliable English-language sources, as well as its usage around 250 million Bengali people in Bangladesh, West Bengal, other states in India and world over, the name Rosogolla has come into majority use. The Oxford Companion to Sugar and Sweets highlights Rosogolla, and describes often-spelled Rasgulla, it is a very new edition published in the United Kingdom and the US. The name Rosogolla has been preferred in several publications in United Kingdom and the US. Some of these books are (1) Milk - Beyond the Dairy: Proceedings of the Oxford Symposium on Food... by Harlan Walke, Page 58. (2) Strategic Management: Formulation, Implementation and Control, by PEARCE, Page 179. (3) Food Culture in India, by Colleen Taylor Sen. There are too many reliable English sources in United Kingdom and the US those mention the sweet as Rosogolla. A confusing entry in the Oxford dictionaries cannot really overlook Rosogolla’s merit as a title name from the reliable English-language sources.

Therefore, my goal is to move the article [Rasgulla]] to Rosogolla and the move would benefit a wider community.",0.0

Disruptive edits?  No - only correcting a falsehood re-inserted by the perpetrator, who took liberties with the """"consensus"""" decision that he was wildly off base.  Even in a footnote, his original research that islands in the Fraser River are """"not actually part of the continuous mainland"""" is fictitious and constitute digging in his heels on his position; I simply corrected his (ongoing) error and mis-use of language; he wants to mention the City of Richmond, not its main island (Lulu Island, which also includes about 1/3 of the City of New Westminster, namely Queensborough), yet his """"footnote"""" spoke of Richmond as an island.  I'm not the one making the disruptive edits.  Franamax, who's familiar with the area, also concurs about the notion that freshwater islands are obviously part of the mainland and distinct from offshore islands such as Bowen; and that same footnote also re-digs in the false notion that dictionary definitions have anything to do with the meaning of the name.  The RfC accomplished nothing, except the consensus refutation of any validity to his position, and rile my back up over something wildly silly in nature for no good reason; and the RfC closed, with the consensus that JimWae's position was wrong, but a footnote explaining , not asserting.  JimWae simply went ahead and reinserted his original problem-content as if it were all peachy keen and he had won.  But he didn't even get the English idiom """"contiguous mainland"""" correct, I corrected that; he also wanted to centre on the City of Richmond even though that's not, in and of itself, an island (it's about 20); I simply pointed out the absurdity of what he had added by adding other things that didn't fit the dictionary definitions attached to """"lower"""" and """"mainland"""".  If you give as license to absurdity, or tolerate it, then you have to tolerate absurdities ensuant on it with impartiality.  Rivers and lakes are not land, but they are part of """"the mainland"""", mountain peaks are not """"lower"""", but they are part of the Lower Mainland.  So either the RfC stands - with JimWae's assertions being dismissed as original research - or you are enforcing a selective interpretation of it forbidding anyone from altering what JimWae wants to add, even though his addition was not supported by the RfC.  *A* footnote was tolerated by the RfC, or suggested by it.  But nobody said """"let JimWae say whatever he wants so long as it's in footnote form"""".

"proposed deletion of sentence in intro 

This sentence appears in the introductory paragraph. I propose that it should be deleted on the grounds that it is neither a fair summary of Dr. Craig's theology nor does it contain any information which is sufficiently noteworthy to be included in the introductory paragraph. We've not mentioned Craig's debates in the introductory and the few comments about Molinism that he's made are in no way more significant than his debates. Also, the sentence is oddly written and may not make sense to a novice encountering these topics for the first time.

In theology he has also defended Molinism and the belief that God is, since Creation, subject to time.

 Re: Tracker (business software) 

Hello, thanks for your comments on my talk page.  You mention that the article was """"already reviewed by admins and approved for inclusion in Wikipedia"""".  I tried to make clear the purpose of my edit in the edit summary, but I guess I didn't do a good enough job.  I read through the AFD, the DRV, and the past deletions to get an idea of what was going on.  AFD/DRV were able to determine the notability of the article, but you hit it right on in your comment to me that in it's past state the article wasn't much more than a product sheet, which to me is synonymous with advertising.  Wikipedia articles aren't about features lists or product offerings, they are about bringing together neutral, third-party-verified information about topics.  As I'm sure you've seen I rearranged the page a little more since.  I have no problem with the screenshots or product names & descriptions, so I tried several things which display that information in a little bit more standard Wikipedia.  (Also, this is minor, but Wikipedia admins are no different in terms of article approval than any other editor. I am also an admin, but that just gives me the ability to work on more technical aspects of the project).

You are welcome to expand on the article as it is now, but it would be preferable to do it by gathering information from the many third-party sources listed.  The article is very well sourced, but not very much of that information is brought into the article.

As for the List of project management software, with such a relatively short list, it is inappropiate to have several links to the same family of products.  I don't know a way would satisfy your concern, other than to suggest to put the link in the best place you see fit. In the future, it might be worthwhile listing separately the desktop and the web-based products, but not while there is only enough information for one article.  Again, please remember the primary focus of Wikipedia (see What Wikipedia is not), which is to bring neutral information, not advertising or promoting.    """,0.0

Hi, n2e. It's great to have someone with an econ background looking at the Suburban Express article. You've proposed some sensible changes. But, as you can see, CorpM has a very strong point of view. The Suburban Express story is about a 19 year old kid who attacked incumbent Greyhound, decreased fares, increased frequency, and decreased travel times and then weathered attacks based on regulatory capture, predatory pricing, and (not covered in any press) harrassment by the Chicago Transit Authority, which leased space to Greyhound. It is novel in that S.E. sidestepped economic regulation which was designed to ensure legacy carriers (greyhound, et al) a fair return on their investment but which had morphed into a system that supported inefficiency, high fares, and lousy service. Since you teach, I imagine you can appreciate the issues we have with students trying to get what they want, regardless of the agreement they have with us. 

e have battled all sorts of fraud during the course of our history - people making fake tickets, tons of bad checks, people passing their receipt out the bathroom window to a friend who then tells driver he is getting back on, and so forth. Fraud has lead to collection action of various forms, and it recently got some negative press because a small handful of nasty little assholes decided to devote their lives to trashing us. Their actions have not impacted ridership, but they have frustrated my employees and I by trashing us online wherever they get the chance. My instincts tell me that the user who is most committed to injecting POV into the article was contacted by one of the haters, who works in PR for the university and has contacts in that world. 

The supposed """"controversy"""" is a mish-mash of different issues that the haters are promoting, all rolled into one: 1) we filed 100ish small claims suits in a short period of time. the number was unusual because we had about a 2 year backlog of debts to collect; 2) A subcontracted driver was rude to a student who does not speak english. He was promptly reprimanded and we sought to apologize to the passenger, but did not succeed in identifying her. A loudmouth narcissistic attention seeking student who was on the bus posted the story to facebook from the bus and spent every waking moment posting the story everywhere he could. 3) This led to a situation on Reddit where the loudmouth and his friends were trashing S.E. as best they could and the moderator started manipulating the conversation, by deleting comments made in support of S.E. That got out of hand and our attorney sent a demand letter to the moderator. The moderator then exploited free-speech bloggers and caused the BIG STORY to spread. Self-interest came into play - Reddit is owned by conde nast. Reddit benefits from awareness of reddit. Reddit can only exist if users are free to say whatever they want. Conde Nast also owns Ars Technica. Ars Technica wrote several blog posts about how horrible SE is for trying to suppress free speech on reddit. See how this works? Downstream lower-quality blogs regurgitated the free-speech story.

Two of the haters, now armed with SOURCES, took to Wikipedia and transformed this https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Suburban_Express&oldid;=542659074 into a very skewed mess. Then the problem became recursive - bloggers mentioned wikipedia, which led readers to trash the wikipedia page even more. Wiki editors cited the articles that cited wikipedia and the list of blogs that had covered the matter grew and grew. Now, the haters assert that the body of trash-news justifies giving the trash significant weight in the article - to the point where the real story of the company is pushed out. You can see this in corpm's proposed edit. He wants to remove from the lede the fact that the company was started by a student, and other key facts.

In any event, I applaud your efforts to move the article in a more academic direction, and I'm glad that someone with an econ background has arrived on-scene. You may find some stuff here interesting: http://www.toeppen.com

 DEAR Anonymous EE Guy,

Well, I don't know if you really mean to give a full picture of the case, but we could include this one:

http://perso.wanadoo.fr/leuven/reich1.htm

http://perso.wanadoo.fr/leuven/

Who are the web site of Jean-Pierre Voyer, a kind of model person for mister Messager/YBM, and who spred a quiet special form for ideologie, which goal is to play with words and how to defend and argue about things who do not exist, how to play with words and """"fuck others"""" as phrased on his web site, and essentialy, how to display a superior attitude in order to effectively use the communication on internet to their full interest, by using the circumstances frame of the dialogues. This include displaying lies as being facts with such a forcefullness as to convince others. It is called: postsituationnisme, ideologie who is followed by YBM, together with a sympathie to the 3rd reich, and a, by some, called pseudo-Hégelianism. YBM run his forum where he defend the man and his positions, with as much furore as he dispells those of Igor and Grichka Bogdanov. You will found in it concepts as the Superior Race, versus the inferior race, and different creativs ways to talk the technics and language of publicity into a way of """"mass communication"""" and a weapon to convince anyone of anything.

I am sure that this angle will bring a certain shade of light where it was upmost needed, and will constitute the missing piece of the puzzle.

I hope you will excuse my very late assertion or révélation about this subject, but I was myself only made aware of it for a very short time ago, together with the fact that this Voyer and YBM have harrassed people before, writers too, for books who had nothing to do with science, but nevertheless constituted those 2 mens lifes mening for 2 years. Actually they stopped with their first victims at the end of 2002, beginning of 2003, to consacrate their cherish technics of manipulating the masses, and ideologies of diffamation on 2 other subjects, Igor and Grichka Bogdanov.

No need to say that the 2 former victims are still paying for the vices of Voyer and Messager, and that their lifes and career have been destroyed.

Why so much hate against people they didn't knew and had never met? They were only practicing, like serial killers start somewhere, in the shadow, and are only known for much more exposed actions.

Here are some other links who do compleete the picture: The first attacks of Voyer and YBM against XAVIER, the writer: http://aeamh.free.fr/x/agent.html http://aeamh.free.fr/blockhaus/ http://aeamh.free/bk/index.html

YBM Web site:

http://aeamh.free.fr
Site Voyer: http://perso.wanadoo.fr/leuven/reich1.htm http://perso.wanadoo.fr/leuven/

I consider this information for being central in the matter at hand, as all accusations will have fallen and nothing much will have come from the original and following J. Baez paper on the subject if it hadn't been for Messager and Voyers' questionnable work in the name of very questionnable motives, all accomplished to serve a completely useless ideology. I think that this will teach us all a lesson regarding objectivity and our hability to evaluate a given problem properly, and to be able to use our sense of sceptisisme ans sound judgement. On a more general way and even more central here, our power to distinguish between agreeing to a given opinion based on facts, and being manipulate in doing so for all the wrong reasons.

This information compleete the picture and gave it its true mening, even if it is by showing how meningsless a huge part of this affair was.

"""= Traffic drives improvement ===

The outlines aren't complete, but they are complete enough to be useful to readers.  And what good is a table of contents hidden in the back?  Tables of contents are most useful in the front.

The hatnote issue is very similar to adding the """"Contents"""" link to the sidebar.  And you opposed that too, on the grounds that the system wasn't ready to be displayed.

Shenme captured the essence of the situation very well:

A 'normal' wiki usually doesn't have a core structure, and so people don't expect it, but Wikipedia has quite a lot of material, and various ways of organizing it.  Having a link in the sidebar to the contents page will help people to discover what organization there is.  (whether perfect or not a separate topic).  And, actually, pointing people to the contents page and getting their resulting comments will improve the page.  Don't wait for the improvements first...  

The OOK needs editors for each of its pages, and for the essential pages it's missing.  Relying on a small team to finish all of this will take decades. (Do the math).  I've been on this project for almost 4 years already!

So, if hatnotes will benefit readers while attracting editors to these pages, then that looks like a pretty damn good solution to me.

 Is Occupy Oakland ongoing or defunct?  

I concur with 's reversions today on the Occupy movement and Occupy Oakland articles, where other users (possibly vandals) attempted to cast Occupy in the past tense. It's premature to portray the overall movement as deceased. However, solely with respect to Occupy Oakland, this is an issue worth discussing.

Note that the Infobox at Occupy Oakland differs from those on Wikipedia's pages for Occupy movement and Occupy Wall Street, respectively. Occupy Oakland is the only one where the word """"ongoing"""" appears—once on the Date line and again on a separate Status line.

I submit that Occupy Oakland's lack of activity over the past several months suggests that it may now be time to reconsider Wikipedia's use of """"ongoing"""" applied exclusively to Occupy Oakland.

There is currently a small amount of autonomous organizing around two upcoming anniversaries: the group's October 10 birthday and the October 25 riot where Scott Olsen was shot in the head. However, none of this stems from Occupy Oakland collectively or any of its designated committees. It's being conducted strictly by self-appointed individuals. Even allowing that anniversary activities are likely to take place, the question looms: do these constitute evidence of an """"ongoing"""" group or are they merely nostalgic gestures by a few diehard remnants?

I hope  and other experienced Wikipedia editors will clarify this for me. Please, at what point do we stop referring to Occupy Oakland as ongoing?   """,0.0

 Song move 

You gave me some good advice about moving and redirecting pages. Thank you.

Unfortunately, I made a real mess when I tried to move """"Let It Snow"""" to """"Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!""""  When I did the redirect, I accidentally mistyped the title as """"Let It Snow! Let It Snoe! Let It Snow!"""" (notice the """"Snoe"""") and forgot to look before I leapt. If that wasn't bad enough, I then went to the Redirect page for """"Let It Snow"""" and, instead of leaving the misspelling alone, I changed it to redirect to """"Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!"""" (the correct spelling), thus creating that page, which did not previously exist. Thus, when I tried to change the misspelled name to the correct name, I of course got the error that the other page already exists.  

Not to mention that there were some double redirects when I looked in """"What links here,"""" which I was going to start to fix until I realized how badly I messed up the original move. (It turns out that someone had renamed the page in 2005, with no discussion, from """"Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow"""" to """"Let It Snow,"""" a move I would have vehemently protested if I'd been hanging around here at the time.) 

I need some help to undo this. The simplest thing would be to delete the current """"redirect"""" page for the correct title and resume from there, renaming my misspelled page and then looking at the redirects again, but I can't delete pages, and I know the rules about cutting and pasting.  """,0.0

Steve, are you preparing for your FAC run?  I haven't been keeping up with your edits there, because I hurt my back badly and am ... drugged ... so please give me a heads up before you go to FAC, so I can read it.  Best,  (Talk) 

Hi. I don't think the article is too far off FAC now; I've added about 20,000 bytes since the peer review closed. In hindsight, I should have left the PR until after I got the Stoneman book, but I didn't think I'd get much from it (Stoneman has a COI in that he was the head of the Irish Film Board at the time and essentially greenlit the film). Used carefully, however, it's been a real goldmine of production information. I'm still working my way through it, but I don't think there'll be too much else to add other than fine detail; he does tackle the 18 specific points of contention from the petition, but I'll probably err on the side of caution and leave that for the existing sources, which have a little more distance from the subject. Of course, I won't take it to FAC without consulting on its talk page first. Sorry to hear about your back; I really hope it clears up soon (and that the drugs are at least offering some measure of fun; if they're not ... get better drugs!). Best,  T • C 
 no fun, no relief ... better drugs tomorrow if something doesn't improve!   (Talk) 

  The Barnstar of Integrity To Steve, an awesome editor, for bringing a piece of propoganda ... errrr ... """"documentary"""" to featured status, with aplomb, scholarship, diplomacy and neutrality!    (Talk) 

So, at last! It finally staggered across the line like a drunk uncle in an unfinished simile. On the plus side, I've now got the experience of seeing an otherwise excellent article receiving little input because it's on a niche subject. I couldn't have done it without your help; and the same goes for the other editors, who charitably stood aside when I arrogantly started throwing my weight around and rewriting the thing. Hopefully now I can relax by tackling something a little less in-depth or controversial. -) Cheers again,  T • C 
 In my role as FAC delegate, I'm pretty steamed about how you were ignored.  In my role as a Venezuela editor, I'm even more steamed that your neutrality was questioned, since the article is more neutral than I like )  Best,  (Talk) 
I guessed that'd be the case; I know you'd have liked the article to be a little lot more scathing, but had I taken that route I don't think it would have come as far as it has. Instead, the only option was to give enough information about both views of the film to allow intelligent readers to make up their own minds. I think it pretty much does that. As an aside, I'm currently in e-mail correspondence with Stoneman, who says he'll dig into his boxes of material to see if there's anything I can use to clear up Jayen466's last unresolved comment about the conclusion to the BBC investigation. Hopefully, I can get that in before the inevitable main page nomination next April. -) Best,  T • C

"Seriously, How?
I am frustrated by the oblique nature of WP procedures.  You seem to be authoring Administrator Review procedures, so perhaps you can help in two ways.

First, I was drawn here trying to seek review of an administratorPMDrive1061 who deleted one of my articles.  I'm not keen on the back room ways WP operates, but I've certainly edited enough articles.  An article should go through an AfD procedure and be discusseddirect deletion is only for a case that blatantly abuses a policy.  When I went to this guy's talk page to complain, I notice he has polite complaints
from a litany of other writers questioning similar, direct deletion of their articles.  In short, this guy is habitually abusing his power as an administrator.  The significance of my article is not the issue I wish to raise, but I think it will survive a notability challengeit was about a small multi-grade Christian school that educates high school grades.  From everything I've learned, a high school is notable.  Period.  Much more important, I wish to raise this administrator's Abuse of Power.  We need to rid WP of administrators who unilaterally think their opinion is so important that they can simple delete knowledge from the database without anybody else getting to discuss it.  Other editors might roll over, they might not know how out of line this is.  I'm not going to tolerate this because we have to protect WP and its valuable information from people like this.  How do we go about getting this guy out of the elite administrators pool?

Secondly, since you are deep on the inside, maybe you can address this.  WP procedures are just too oblique for the common user to understand.  This stuff is designed for geeks.  It is difficult to find, difficult to understand and is thusly self limiting to the deep insiders who those who spend the time to figure this crap out.  I wish to encourage you to think about simplification, from the procedures, to the search to find the procedures to the explanation of those procedures.  If you note the vote for Global Sysops.

"Lion vs Tiger: Consenses Request 

Hello Keith, I was wondering if you could help fix the lion vs tiger topic, it seems the topic has a certain someone with abusuing wikipedias ethics and using it to pump out some type of bias supremacy, cherry picking and being subjective, even contradicting his own guidelines he uses, makes false accusations and is hypocritical to his own suggestions.

I'd like to start it off with suggesting to review the revision of its current and compare it to a previous one:
https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tiger_versus_lion&diff;=prev&oldid;=591817160

Changes were made simply because some of the data was unreliable as stated in the talk:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Tiger_versus_lion

I have learned that I must only make comments on the edits, and not the editors, so I will try and keep it as so to better adress it. My main delima is, this topic has been unchecked for years, and has no true consensus that is confirmed reliable and un-bias, so I would like to request if you could share the info with a few others to develop a basic un-bias assesment, I'd like to start it off with pointing out a guide line:

Under its:

History

The qualifications: Should be of historical signifcance, so only people with back grounds of Ph.d and Masters degrees should be accepted for reliability and credability via Historians.

Physical comparison

The qualifications: Should be adressed on a species scale, the historical significance is graded on its history, so it must refraim from cherry picking sub-speices via bengal and siberian, but then leave out the malay, sumatran, bali ect and include all of them to reach an average.

Accidental fights in captivity

The qualifications: All historical/modern accounts should be fully brought to the awareness of the world/public, the details should be mentioned for both sides regardless if its a un-fair fight of gender, age, and quanity/odds, all documentation should be accepted according to reliablility, as of now there is only pro-tiger data that is in effect as pure insinuation, via cherry picked while other reliable sources that supports the lion is being constantly erased with no viable reasons other than false accusations and making things up.

Expert opinions

The qualifications: Should be upon people with observation upon seeing them fight, an opinion from someone with experince working with these animals is not enough and holds no merits since the topic is specifically on fighting, if they haven't seen them fight (has no cites mentioning a observed fight) it shoulden't be used, only people who have been eye witnesses to conflicts between the two should be used for credability.

I am suggesting a more fair assesment since what is in place now is subjective, bias and pro-data, both sides of the coin should be mentioned, all the substance should be mentioned both ways, and a fair assesment on what is avaliable to add in should be implimented both ways of its reliability and credability.

Thank you for your time",0.0

 A suggestion 

I'm Comae again. At the Spanish Wikipedia we have been talking about  genealogical trees. It would be very useful for Mithology, kings, Tolkien, and others. The trouble is that we can´t find an usable way to do it, getting links in the tree. I've used HTML lists, but they don't make the cut. Tables are difficult to edit and correct. I was trying to do it with timelines, which may come in handy, but it's not as intuitive for non-tech people to edit later. Now, I see you are already busy with all the trouble with timelines, but I thought you may use a suggestion for future versions, or find an alternative. Thank you for the patience.

"There are two interpretations . Traditional Catholics consider non-Catholics as protestants. Historians consider Christian groups that historicaly protested or antagonized the Catholic Church as protestant, these are typically Lutherans and affiliates. Are the Greek ,Russian and Coptic Orthodox Churches protestant?They have only been geographically separated and developed that way . They maintain many sacraments seen in the Catholic Church. Also Christian coalitions have core requirements like acceptance of the Divinity of Jesus as the Son of God, Holy Trinity, Ressurection and Salvation through grace, personal relation to J.C. etc. Jehovah's Witnesses, Adventists, etc, don't accept all of these. Even the Catholic Church accepts (I believe) certain groups as Christian even if they don't recognize the Pope as long as the fulfill these Christian requirements.

From the Hood quote it certainly looks as though it's altered enough (and both versions were successful enough) for each to have a separate article - that's one issue.

As for the other - I'd say it's definitely an operetta. Unless we can prove some substantial alteration of the music - style, vocal range, whatnot - it's the music from an operetta, and the show is an operetta.

If this was a legal Wiki, you might have a valid point. It's not, so you don't. Why don't you get a ruling as to whether plain english can be used on this Wiki?
The lede is supposed to encapsulate the rest of the article which is quiet clear that this was a murder - not an accidental, natural or judicially sanctioned death.

I do sympathise and understand that for Sinn Féin and the Provisional IRA, the current phase of the conflict is about the definition of the conflict itself. For the self-esteem of the so-called republican movement, and for the political future of Sinn Féin, it is vital that its 30-year campaign of violence be remembered as a just war, a regrettable but necessary method of achieving a legitimate aim. The vile and sordid deeds that run through that campaign may, under pressure, be described as wrong. They may be accepted as """"mistakes"""". PIRA may acknowledge, in the curiously passive language it favours, that these things """"should not have happened"""". But they must never, ever, be called crimes. God forbid!

 Result of PIRA investigation 

Why exactly do you think that the views of PIRA should not be fairly represented on Wikipedia in reference to the (presumed?) death of Jean_McConville?

I am rather puzzled as to why you keep excising my new section referencing  the PIRA """"Statement on the the Abduction and Killing of Mrs Jean McConville in December 1972"""", (dated 8 July 2006) by P O’Neill, Irish Republican Publicity Bureau, Dublin

Is it just because you are still editing carelessly and without respect to other editor's work by just hitting the revert button when you see 'naughty words' such as Murder and PIRA?

However, I must congratulate your improvement in tone (if not the quality and care you take with your actual edits). Keep up the improvement!...(kiwiexile at DMOZ)  • """,0.0

"ACT OF VANDALISM BY KRAKATOA KATIE

This person has completely obliterated all of my contributions to the Billy the Kid article. KrakatoaKatie has replaced what had been the most detailed, and accurate, account of Billy the Kid's life that has appeared on Wikipedia so far and reverted to an account that contains absolute garbage. This was done as an act of PURE VANDALISM by a person that has an agenda that has nothing to do with improving the content of this article. Quite the contrary - the clear intent hear was to destroy that article - WITH MALICIOUS INTENT - and replace it with something inferior that takes the treatment back to a comic book level. I ask any board members, editors, and Wild West History buffs associated with
Wikipedia to look at my last version, and compare to what KrakatoaKatie has replaced it with. I ask all of you to compare this act of vandalism by someone with an agenda, to the contribution made by someone who has a proven, 40-year, track record as a Wild West historian. I hope you will all speak out and prevent this sort of thing from happening to others who are making an honest effort to improve the accuracy of Wikipedia articles. Please make your feelings known.

 (from WT:VG)  A quick look shows that the list in its current form is WP:GAMECRUFT and WP:TRIVIA without additional context. Merely listing all the factions adds no encyclopedic understanding without some kind of context. Who are they, how are they different, why are they included and not others, what did developer want to do, what did they do, how did players and critics respond, what are the parallels with real world, what are the differences? That is the kind of material WP:WAF expects. And that material is suited for prose. Including some examples is fine, but listing them all (especially in bullet-point form) is unnecessary.

2 –POW losses of 1.6 million are included with civilian dead.
3- Losses of   2.3 million in western Byelorussia & Ukraine are included with Poland by western historians. The Russians include these losses with the USSR. To avoid duplication these losses need to backed out of Soviet or Polish losses.
4- To arrive at the total loss of 26.6 million the Russians assume only 450,000 persons emigrating after WW2. The actual emigration was about 1 million which means losses were overstated by about 600,000.
5-The Soviet population recorded in the 1939 census was 168.5 million not 170.5 million. Stalin ordered the number to be falsified.
6- Soviet civilian losses of  about 3 million persons due to famine in the territory not occupied by the Germans are included in the total losses of 26.6 million. .
7-The Germans had 1 million Soviet deserters in their Army. 215,000 were killed in action. The need to be included with German losses
8- In addition to the war losses of 26.6 million the Russians and the PC crowd in the west  tend  to ignore the1.7 million Soviet citizens that died due to communist terror ( I realize is not NPV but it is a fact that can’t be ignored)

I have been wondering about Polycheles typhlops. I would have nominated it myself for DYK, if only I had been able to find a good hook. It really is a fascinating animal, but there's nothing (cited) in the text that jumped out as instantly notable. I agree that the """"two species"""" claim is false, and that the reference proves it (planktonic larvae can be easier to find than animals living on the sea floor at depths of >2000 m, so it's not that surprising that species have been missed). I wasn't sure if someone else would find a good way of re-wording it and save the DYK entry; I certainly couldn't think of one, but I didn't vote it down just in case. That DOI is an odd thing indeed. Springer Link definitely gives the same DOI I put in the article, but dx.doi.org doesn't recognise it. It's not even as if it's a very new article that hasn't made it into the DOI database yet. I have added a link directly to the journal article; I am wary of removing the DOI, because it *ought* to be right, although I doubt that it will come back to life.

Flan etc.

Hi, thanks for contributing to the Crème caramel article. I have a few comments which I hope will help you edit this and other articles more effectively.

You have changed 'flan' to 'Flan', arguing that 'flan' is a proper noun. Do you have any evidence for that?  Why is it not a common noun like other names of dishes, e.g. pizza, roast beef, moussaka, etc.?  Do you have any reliable sources backing up your claim?

You have also added vertical whitespace presumably to make the photos format better.  Unfortunately, that method is not reliable  as WP:PIC says, """"Remember that text will flow and wrap differently for other users, based on their chosen browser, screen resolution, default font size, accessibility options, number of toolbars and sidebars (such as instant messaging panes) and more.

 Some tips for making your stubs a bit better 

Apart from your over-reliance on Soccerway (which isn't always a WP:RS), I've noticed there are some other aspects of your created articles which need substantial improvement. Typing """"player who plays"""" is poor English, try to put """"footballer who plays..."""" or """"soccer player who represents..."""" The word """"currently"""" is pretty pointless too - I mean, they either play for the team or they don't, right? Also, try not to say they play for Bayern Munich in the Frauen-Bundesliga. Put of the Frauen-Bundesliga instead, because they play matches for their teams outside the league too. Please remember to always put the stub tags at the bottom of the article, this will draw attention to the fact that your creations require expansion and improvement. These are just small suggestions, but hopefully by taking this advice you will get better and eventually take some steps on the path to becoming a worthwhile contributor. Thanks,   """,0.0

As I explained in an edit summary this sentence attempts to summarise the information in mephedrone#UK. 'People have died after taking mephedrone' is intended to summarise """"mephedrone had been alleged to be involved in 52 fatalities in the UK, but detected in only 38 of these cases"""". Likewise 'some deaths the media attributed to the drug were later determined to have been caused by other factors' is summarising """"The death of a teenager in the UK in November 2009 was widely reported as being caused by mephedrone, but a report by the coroner concluded she had died from natural causes. In March 2010, the deaths of two teenagers in Scunthorpe were widely reported by the media to be caused by mephedrone. Toxicology reports showed the teenagers had not taken any mephedrone and had died as a result of consuming alcohol and the heroin substitute methadone"""". Both parts are important and should be mentioned in the lead and if you read the references you should realise that this is exceptional to mephedrone as deaths were over-reported and mis-reported by the media - comparisons with other topics are irrelevant. I agree that it is a bit weasely, but how else to you suggest that that section is summarised? WP:LEADCITE is very vague about whether citations are required and when I wrote the lead I erred on making it easier to read rather than ensuring that every fact was supported by a citation there (Wikipedia:Citation_overkill). I could easily copy the references from the main article to the lead for this sentence, but then someone will likely come along and complain that other sentences don't have citations... IMO this is a waste of time when readers could just find the relevant citations in the main body of the article.   """,0.0

Exactly, Kelly knew what color her eyes were when she made the song """"Behind These Hazel Eyes"""". Comparing the pictures of Kelly and Belle, they do seem to share the same eye color just slightly different shades of it - Belle's eyes are little lighter. Someone made a video called """"Behind Belle's Hazel Eyes"""", the person who made this video knew what color Belle's eyes were and decided to include Belle's name in the title. And if you read the comments, the people fully agree her eyes are hazel with comments like """"green or hazel? they look more hazel than brown or green . yup belles﻿ eyes are deffinetely hazel problem solved"""". I like the """"problem solved"""" part. With Minotaurgirl's bias against the idea of Belle having hazel eyes, I think there will always be a problem with people like her involved.

TV Tropes has already suffered an edit war because of her, so much so they forbade users from writting what Belle's eye color is. Notice how Belle's name is missing from the Eye Color tropes colony, while the rest of Disney Princesses have their eye color mentioned. Belle's name was there under the category of Hazel Eyes until Minotaurgirl came along and ruined it all. Same thing almost happened to Disney Wiki. This is Minotaurgirl's account, as you can see she got blocked with an expiry time of infinite, the reason; inserting false information, the false information being writting down Belle's eyes as brown.] And now here's Minotaurgirl on the Wikipedia. Is there any repsite from her?

I noticed she has a Live Journal account. See what she has written. The lack of links speaks for itself. She thinks she actually proved Belle's eyes are brown, depsite the fact what she has presented as evidence is either a minority or a plain old lie, like the screenshots she send me. By magnifying the images, you can see her eyes are hazel-colored and not the same color as her hair at all. Notice how she's afriad to use close-ups of Belle's eye cuz she knows they'll appear hazel if she did so, thus disproving her. On her blog, she didn't mention that she was blocked on Disney Wiki, and said the only reason Disney Wiki kept Belle's eyes color as hazel was to shut up people who keep writting her eyes as hazel, when in reality the one who got shut up was Minotaurgirl as she got blocked while the others didn't. She wrote """"Bleh. Kids these days. This one needs a hobby. I'm tired of wasting time trying to undo this snot's damage, and I'm fairly sure the mods of these sites are too. Would it be possible to just...block this person off the internet entirely until they learn some manners?"""" Yup, she calls people who use logic and legitimate evidence to prove their point snots and hobby-less kids if the evidence goes against what Minotaurgirl said/believes.

If anyone deserves to be blocked, it's Minotaurgirl. If it wasn't for her bias, sites like like TV Tropes, Disney Wiki and the Wikipedia wouldn't have suffered an edit war about Belle's eye color. The fact that there was never an edit about Belle's eye color until Minotaurgirl came along, says a lot. Ever since she got blocked from Disney Wiki almost an year ago, no edit war about Belle's eye color happened there either. It's like Minotaurgirl is the only person on the entire internet who refuses to accept Belle's eyes as hazel and is willing to go to every page and change her eye color to brown, just cuz she likes to think so, not because the world thinks so or any legit evidence are presented. It's like someone going around changing Ariel's eyes from blue to green, just cuz he likes the idea of Ariel being green-eyed. Thinks don't work like that.

My overall opinion on Minotaurgurl. I think it's safe to say the interent is better off without her. She's toxic, she's a nuisance, she's talks trash to people just cuz they disagree with her, she lies, she mangles, twists and misrepresents other people's words, and she causes edit wars.

 Worst Season ever 
Anyone who likes Seasons 4 and onward have obviously NOT seen any of the old episodes from 1999-2004 and therefore is a total dickbag. I can never tell you how much I HATE the new SpongeBob!!! Nick had stopped caring about good animation and started caring only about the cash the SECOND they started this show. The old ones are great, while the new ones, I'd give an F plus 500 million minuses! I'd be so damn shocked if anybody even likes these new episodes, because anyone who does is downright retarded. It's like all Nick's staff wants to do now is win themselves a bunch of hot girls!

When the stooges at Nick began this show, it was nothing but great humor for 5 years. Now, SpongeBob's crew had lost ANY sight of what """"good quality"""" is all about! The writing is totally fucked up! I mean, Seriously, """"For Here or To Go""""? Who the fucking hell would watch an episode about taking orders at a fast food restaurant deciding whether or not to eat it at the restauraunt or home? I know there are now just copying off ideas of old episodes. Ex: Petsitter Pat. Patrick says the bath is gonna come to Gary. That's EXACTLY what SpongeBob said to Gary in """"Gary Takes a Bath"""", but that version is WAAAAAAY better than this new junk that anybody likes is mentally challenged and obviously hasn't watched the first three seasons! Even true SpongeBob fans should only like Season 1-3, because no episodes past that were even remotely decent. And I know for a fact it will never be as good as it used to be. I'm 100% certain that is true. ANYBODY who likes anything of the Post Movie era is just either brain-dead or childish. Stephen Hillenburg really knew quality, but now we just have a bunch of screwed-up polesmokers who only want the money. And NOTHING else! They're just like fucking Mr. Krabs clones! Paul Tibbit must be drunk or something, and Tom Kenny must have swallowed a slide whistle, because now SpongeBob is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING EXCEPT FOR UTTER GARBAGE THAT IS ALL BUT INTOLERABLE!!! Like I said, I cannot believe there are people that actually LIKE these new episodes! Everybody that likes Seasons 4-8 smoke too much crack! Anybody who's into the new SpongeBob doesn't know shit about quality if it hit him square in the ballsack! All I can say is, I am SO RELIEVED this show is ending in 2014. Only 2 more years of this trash that I will have to sit through! If they make a SpongeBob Channel, they should only do reruns of the first three seasons, because absolutely nothing afterwards was good. So there goes 7 years of my life I know I will never get back.

That was a bit of a guess on my part as regards your knowledge; for all I actually know, you've never set foot in an auto parts store. But since you're having this conversation, I assumed, perhaps rightly and perhaps wrongly, that you have seen such auto parts packaging. I have, but that's exactly my point: the verifiability rules of Wikipedia mean that we don't get to plug in our own knowledge as fact on the assumption that it is universal (or a """"general truth known to all"""", as you put it). Assertions in articles must be backed by reference to reliable sources, no matter how sure we are of what we personally know.

Not true! The actual issue was that you deleted ALL the links I added for him. That is the recap.

Now you're trying to claim you only deleted the one that was a problem. Even your edit summary is wrong. The man's resignation was presented the same day I was adding the links, unknown to me, so it seems the Parliament link was being moved from current to former which caused pointer problems when I clicked on it. Things happen. It only needed to be fixed. I would have thought an Admin would be capable of figuring that out. Nor could you figure out how to leave a message on my Talk page so I could figure it out. You just couldn't wait to smash everything.

Consensus
With regard to your statement: """"Regarding the mediation, this would appear to be a situation of a few editors dissenting with a large consensus. Am I correct about that?"""" I think it's about right, but does need to be qualified. Some editors, like Matt Britt and Seraphimblade, still do strongly support the binary prefixes (but, to their credit, never edit warred over them). There was, however, an emerging consensus to allow the use of parenthetical disambiguation alongside legacy prefixes, as opposed to replacing them with binary prefixes. I'm convinced a workable solution can be devised if the edit warring stops. In my opinion, Sarenne's role in all this has been highly counterproductive, though I am also guilty to an extent for participating in an ongoing edit war. *** Crotalus *** """,0.0

 Conflict of Interest 

Pm_shef: This is an attempt to resolve the concerns that relate to your conduct on Wikipedia and the editing of articles that you are personally involved in.   

As you know, the official policy of Wikipedia, according to WP:NOT, is that Wikipedia is not a soapbox, and that editors should avoid contributing to articles that they are personally involved in. That doesn't mean that your edits have not been neutral; rather, it means that any editing at all of Vaughan Council-related articles is inappropriate, no matter what is written. 

Here is the fulltext, from WP:NOT: 

Wikipedia is not a soapbox
Wikipedia is not a soapbox, or a vehicle for propaganda and advertising. Therefore, Wikipedia articles are not:
Propaganda or advocacy of any kind. Of course, an article can report objectively about such things, as long as an attempt is made to approach a neutral point of view. You might wish to go to Usenet or start a blog if you want to convince people of the merits of your favorite views. You can also use Wikinfo which promotes a """"sympathetic point of view"""" for every article.
Self-promotion. The arbitration committee ruled on February 17, 2006 that: """"Editors should avoid contributing to articles about themselves or subjects in which they are personally involved, as it is difficult to maintain NPOV while doing so.""""  Creating overly abundant links and references to autobiographical articles, or to articles in which you have a personal stake, is similarly unacceptable. See Wikipedia:Autobiography and Wikipedia:Notability.
Advertising. Articles about companies and products are fine if they are written in an objective and unbiased style. Furthermore, all article topics must be third-party verifiable, so articles about very small """"garage"""" companies are not likely to be acceptable. External links to commercial organizations are acceptable if they can serve to identify major corporations associated with a topic (see finishing school for an example). Please note Wikipedia does not endorse any businesses and it does not set up affiliate programs. See also WP:CORP for a proposal on corporate notability.
-

I understand that you've written to a user that you will not be involved anymore in Vaughan-related articles. That's a commendable position. I'm sure there are many subjects and articles of interest to you on Wikipedia that do not relate to your father or his opponents. Do I understand your position correctly? And is this approach of abstention one that you permanently take? If so, I again commend that position. I trust, as I'm sure you do, that the administrators and the contributors to Wikipedia will maintain quality articles about worthy and reputable subjects.  """,0.0

"""

Unfortunately, I don't know the literature on this field that well, just the general background. -) So I know how most of the techniques work, who some of the experts are on a couple of the topics, and I can point out if a particular source doesn't seem to understand the science. But I would say that it's too broad a topic (and not enough is known) for it to be covered in the scientific literature as a single unit. 

That said, these reviews might be useful - please let me know if I can explain anything for you. I've just added them to a couple of articles, so you may come across them in Wikipedia as well. -) I can also recommend more sources on any specific topics of interest. 

Gene therapy is the field that's furthest along. Related articles of interest include vectors in gene therapy (aka delivery methods) and genome editing. There are also techniques such as SCNT (where the entire nucleus is replaced - this is how Dolly was cloned), but I hesitate to consider those genetic engineering. 
Another field that comes to mind is regenerative medicine, although that article isn't nearly comprehensive. This (and the related field of tissue engineering) mainly focus on applications such as the growth of organs for transplant, starting from stem cells. However, it doesn't currently use much genetic engineering; the closest it gets is genetic reprogramming (I was extremely surprised to find that article didn't exist; I've just created it.)
As far as I'm aware, the use of genetic engineering to give humans new traits (as opposed to prevention or cures) is mostly speculative, although the techniques should apply in the same way. Synthetic biology is the closest (in that it attempts to devise new traits), but it's still just beginning and is extremely far from any application in humans. I imagine that most of the descriptions of technology will be like this (not yet applicable to humans but could be in the future), other than that which applies to human cells in culture.
The scope of the article is uncertain to me. Most of the sources that use """"human genetic engineering"""" as a viable description discuss ethics rather than science. (Of course, the ethics is important as well, but my familiarity is with the science.) There is a lot of scientific detail that can be discussed, but as I mentioned above, the science itself doesn't usually use such a broad categorization. 
The science is moving quickly. An article written in 2012 may have a significantly different background context from one written in 2011. 
Modification is easiest at the zygote or blastocyst stage. There is a bit of information on how this is done at transgenic mouse. (It's not done in humans, of course.)
There are a lot of people who use language such as """"the next stage in human evolution."""" (This is something I removed from the article.) I think I also saw it in a couple of respectable sources when I was editing this page, but it's at the least imprecise/poor wording and (at least in my opinion) should be attributed if included. It is valid under a broader definition where """"evolution"""" simply means """"change over time,"""" but it implies some mechanism of progress or goal-directedness (""""stages"""") - so it is somewhat misleading when applied to biological evolution, which doesn't have these properties. 

I won't be available much for at least the next few days, but please let me know if you have any questions. -) If it's more than a week, please feel free to remind me on my talk page (since the message will drop off my watchlist).   """,0.0

This article is indeed biased due to the use of adjectives projected upon the EDL. Within the wiki talk page there appears to be sufficient evidence that the characterization of the EDL has not been fact-based, but in some cases the opinion of opposition groups. This very argument is taking place on the talk page of the UAF where they have successfully garnered favorable edits to their own description with the omission of the term left-wing, yet the EDL ‘s group type currently stands as “far right-wing”.  Even when the nature of a topic is agreeably abhorrent, the moment one describes said topic with words such as atrocity or (insert)phobic, the subject has become tainted with opinion.  As the world descends upon Wikipedia to learn about these groups due to recent events; it is vital that factual information be provided. I’ve never heard of the EDL until a few days ago, yet someone like myself, untainted by prejudice; can see this article is biased at face-value. Lacking an omnipotent author, the introductory description of the EDL should largely come from how the EDL describes itself. Any evidence to the contrary should be cited properly where Wikipedia provides.

Addendum documentation for ArbCom (reverted from AN by Future Perfect at Sunrise twice)

 (12 hours later) the admin reverted their message
(Now, we can consider the matter of what happened.)
 [Aftermath note 1]: I created this topic when I was concerned there might be an serious (emergency) situation, but did not have sufficient knowledge of the editor's history (especially recent onwiki conversations) to judge how serious the matter was — but I had just observed behavior which was sufficiently out of the norm to not simply dismiss the replacement/message on their user page.  (interact)  

 [Aftermath note 2.a]: I  may be incorrect, but I do not believe Equazcion had sufficient knowledge of the history of the administrator to simply dismiss the matter. Unfortunately, there may be more to discuss about the interaction above, but let us first clarify if I am correct or incorrect with regard to Equazcion's knowledge of the administrator history (especially recent communications/interactions).  (interact)  

[Aftermath note 2.b]: In the interaction above Equazcion has characterized my interaction with the administrator (on User talk: Jimbo Wales) prior to the administrator's user page replacement message. Before we discuss this further, perhaps Equazcion may wish to reconsider the characterizations.  (interact)  

(I will immediately notify Equazcion of the notes 2.a and 2.b above so they may comment.  (interact)  )

===Question(s) for administrators regarding the user talk message===
The big question, of course, do we need to follow up regarding this?
 Clearly an administrator replacing their user page (and especially leaving it that way for 12 hours) with that is an inappropriate reaction to any situation. 
Note that the administrator's edits just prior to their user page replacement were:
 User talk: Jimbo Wales Revision as of 02:27, 14 February 2010 Rodhullandemu (→Bloqued WHY?: reply, and fuck you.)
 User talk: Jimbo Wales Revision as of 02:34, 14 February 2010 Rodhullandemu (→Bloqued WHY?: I'm gone.)
 User talk: Jimbo Wales Revision as of 02:41, 14 February 2010 Rodhullandemu (→Bloqued WHY?: goodbye)
Now, what is all that the reaction to? (Hint: A mock and a """"hear hear"""")
 Revision as of 02:15, 14 February 2010 Proofreader77 (→Bloqued WHY?: (edit conflict) Retort to Rodhullandemu  who clearly has too many stars on their veteran editors medal ^;^ (Note: Python logic chip activated for Valentine's day drama)

Hope the picture is clearer: This page (currently) focuses primarily on slave practices in Africa prior to the Islamic and Atlantic slave trades and then with a brief section on how those practices in Africa were transformed by the slave trades.  Connected to this page are Arab slave trade, Atlantic slave trade both of which are pretty good (although I prefer Islamic slave trade).  Less good are African slave trade and Slavery in modern Africa.  The first is an invention, there's no books about the """"African slave trade"""" (Davidson's book of that title is about the """"Atlantic Slave Trade"""") and probably a POV title. This is not to deny an """"indigenous"""" practice or trade in slaves for much of history; but simply that the focus on """"African slave trade"""" is prominent on wikipedia but not in the major books on the topic. Much of its content has long standing tags, some very problematic sources, and POV writing style.  The page could persist but only as a short exploration of the participation of Africans on inland trade of slaves and slave raiding.  The Slavery in modern Africa seems to have a good structure and some good portions, but needs some heft and a title change.  In terms of content overlap, there is some significant content overlap between """"African slave trade"""" with both """"Slavery in Africa"""" and """"Atlantic slave trade"""" (largely because African slave trade is a problematic title and because it analytically wandered).  Most of the other pages refer to each other, but content does not appear to overlap. Idea for reorganization (I'll expand this to more editors, but want to see if anyone has any ideas here first): 1. African slave trade page gets merged into """"Slavery in Africa"""" or other pages as appropriate. 2. Slavery in modern Africa gets changed name to Slavery in contemporary Africa, as more appropriate. 3. Slavery in Africa page largely eludes to slave trades without devoting significant section to the topic, that stays with the slave trade pages themselves. 4. A new article on """"Emancipation movements in Africa"""" or something needs to be created. It is a major topic which is covered as much as the slave trades were ended, but then glossed over entirely by other pages. Any thoughts on this organization?   """,0.0

Pure curiosity only, so apologies in advance if I end up being one of a stream of people knocking at your door today, but I'm genuinely wondering. I noticed that the remedies in the date delinking case were updated based on the revisions that were passed recently. I'm just wondering if there's a usual way that the case page is updated for something like this? It appears that you overwrote the new remedies on top of the old ones, with the original date and vote totals remaining in place — as a result, without checking the history, it looks as though that were the original remedy. In a different remedy revised earlier, the new remedy was entered with the current date and vote total, and the original remedy was placed into a collapse box. It's probably as simple as different clerks, different approaches, but I guess I was a little surprised there's no defined process for something like this. Regards,",0.0

"Good morning,
I am Barry Slemmings. I was a professional journalist for 30 years finishing as a sub-editor/proof reader before my retirement in 2003. I now work as an unpaid volunteer on Brancaster Beach. I live in Docking and near to Fakenham.

You have queried some changes that I have made on the Brancaster page.
If you check the page history you will find that I am the original author of the whole section entitled 'National Trust and the beach'. There is no 'original research' anywhere on the entire Brancaster page as it is all written from the local knowledge of myself and others who came to it before me. That is the nature of town and village pages on Wiki. The changes I have made to the NT and the Beach section were due to recent changes 'on the ground' and were at the request of my boss to keep it inline with the National Trust's own information policy. My boss knows that I edit the Wiki page and it is highly regarded locally. I would ask you to revert my changes.

On the rest of the Brancaster page I also wrote Geography and Geology and substantially re-wrote Shipwreck on the Beach a couple of years ago. Again most of this is local knowledge and very hard (almost impossible) to 'prove' as original research. As local knowledge I assurre you that it is accurate as otherwise you would have received complaints or someone else would have re-edited my errors. In the UK Wiki is highly regarded for such local knowledge.

The other changes regarding Fakenham and Docking were minor edits and are due to changing information. Towns and villages are not sterile, they change and evolved. I was merely up-dating, as a good sub-editor would. I would again ask you to reconsider reverting to my changes.

Elsewhere - in other subjects - I often make minor edits to correct spelling, punctuation or minor errors. That's that old sub-editor and proof-reader coming out in me. Once a wordsmith, always a wordsmith and I hope that Wiki benefits from your efforts and mine.

Please let me know your thoughts.

 The casual reader should receive the message that the expulsions were agreed to at the Yalta and Potsdam conferences.  They should also be aware that Stalin outmaneuvered the gullible Western Allies at both those conferences.  Stalin didn't care about the Poles (he killed 22,000 Poles, mostly Polish military officers, at Katyn in 1940); Stalin was more concerned about gaining back lands lost in the early 1920s, namely lands within the 1937 Polish border east of the Curzon Line.  That land area had a population which included 40% ethnic Poles.  Stalin needed somewhere to dump those Poles, so he proposed that Germans be moved west & the Poles be moved west.  Roosevelt was dying in 1945 - he was easily outmaneuvered by Stalin.

After so much time, i think, we can finnaly understand this, a blast from the past...

This was not addressed: """"You have three texts, all AP from the end of January, not the beginning of the war, which mention in this context, 'southern communities'. The phrasing they used is identical. So you edit is referenced now. It remains for me, at least, to see whether that formula employed by the Associated Press reflects precisely Israeli government or IDF statements of intent expressed when the assault began on Dec.27, or whether it is retrospective."""" -Nishidani 
Because if we DO go back to the beginning of this conflict(and we should when addressing the lead), we'll find the following: 
Dec 30 - Israel attacks Gaza for the fourth day - http://www.kbc.co.ke/story.asp?ID=54699 (from the BBC)

On goals(aim) - """"Israel's defence chief earlier said his country was fighting a """"war to the bitter end"""" against Hamas.""""

On whether to use 'stated' or not - """"Israel says its aim is to end the rocket attacks by Hamas-linked militants - of which there were reportedly more than 40 on Monday.""""

Dec 27 - Israel's attack on Gaza kills hundreds - http://www.contracostatimes.com/california/ci_11323391

On goals - """"The government said the open-ended campaign was aimed at stopping rocket attacks that have traumatized southern Israel.""""

""""Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said late Saturday that the goal was """"to bring about a fundamental improvement in the security situation."""" He added, """"It could take some time.""""

""""Stated""""? - see above plus """"Israel warned it might go after Hamas' leaders, and militants kept pelting Israel with rockets - killing at least one Israeli and wounding six.

Dec 30 - Israel Assaults Hamas In Gaza - http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/12/27/israel-launches-air-strik_n_153664.html

On goals - """"Israel's stated goal is to cripple Hamas' ability to launch rockets at Israeli towns, which means that a ground invasion is becoming more likely as it becomes clear that airstrikes alone cannot finish the job.""""

""""Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak has declared """"all-out war against Hamas.""""

""""Stated""""? Yes. But infrastructure? and since Hamas fire those rockets from civilians area, not having military bases of their own, police stations and houses in gaza are Hamas' infrastructures?

I recognized Nishidani's point as being that from the beginning there was ambiguity as to what this Israel's attack was to bring Israel itself. Now there was a target inside Gaza, Hamas, there is war, but is war about what? goals? yes to some degree, but most of those goals can't be archived until conquering has been archived(re:Iraq war, AND Israel's previous occupations of both Lebanon and Palestine)...so to cripple Gaza, only Hamas's """"infrastructure"""" was the """"stated"""" goal?

At what point, even Israel's foreign minister was at odds with what the prime minister was """"stating"""" as the goals for this operation.

Needless to say then, it would be a great disservice if we use Israel's """"stated goals"""" as of Jan 30.

My humble suggestion is to leave it as """"The operation was aimed at..."""" Stated is a loaded term.

There should be even more discussion on this BTW. Cryptonio (talk) 

Plus, Dec 30 - ANALYSIS / Hamas is hoping for an IDF ground operation in Gaza - http://haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1051024.html

On goals - """"The operation's goals, as defined by the cabinet, are """"creating a different long-term security situation in the south, while bolstering Israel's deterrence."""" The IDF does not interpret this to mean a complete end to the rocket fire, as it considers this impossible. Rather, its goal is to eliminate Hamas' desire to attack Israel. The bombing campaign has so far dealt a severe blow to Hamas.""""

Fire in the hole. Notice ref to """"as defined""""(so they are defining what they are stating? or vice-versa?) plus IDF does not interpret what's been stated(which of course was defined before it was stated) which at the end, they disregard what was stated for them(perhaps rather just defined, in order for them to interpret on their own?) because they found what was 'defined' for them impossible(or what they interpreted as being defined to them).

Thanks for the reply. The Arbcom's ruling, to my reading, did not take a position on the issue of categorization. Categorization based on religion and sexual orientation are, quite rightly, singled out with additional criteria that do not apply to information in the text of an article. I think there is a serious question that remains as to whether membership in a house of worship, by itself, satisfies the """"public self-identification"""" requirement of the rule. This issue will very likely come up in other biographies of people from a variety of faiths. Categories, especially regarding religion and sexual orientation, are more than simple navigational tools, but can give undue weight to specific elements of a person's background.

 News suppressed on Wikipedia http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html 

RexCurry.net is the historian who made the following discoveries covered elsewhere and on Wikipedia:

1. The USA’s first Pledge used a straight-arm salute and it was the origin of the salute of the monstrous National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis).  It was not an ancient Roman salute.  http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html

2. The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html   Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute is an extended military salute. http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html

3. The Pledge’s creator was a self-proclaimed socialist in the nationalism movement in the USA and his dogma influenced socialists in Germany, and his Pledge was the origin of their salute. """"Nazi"""" means """"National Socialist German Workers' Party."""" A mnemonic device is the swastika (Hakenkreuz in German).  Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent """"S"""" letters for their """"socialism.""""  Hitler altered his own signature to use the same stylized """"S"""" letter for """"socialist.""""
http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html

The Pledge is part of the USA’s growing police-state.  The insane government in the U.S. could cause comatose persons to Pledge dis-allegiance, desecrate the flag, and recite a declaration of independence. Remove the Pledge from the flag, remove flags from schools, remove schools from government.

As a libertarian lawyer, Rex Curry provides pro bono services nationwide in schools and elsewhere, to educate the public about the news.

Government schools will never teach children about their Pledge rights, nor the truth about the Pledge and its author.

Most comments fail to ever mention that Francis Bellamy and his cousin Edward Bellamy were National Socialists in the USA, wrote for and supported their """"Nationalist"""" and """"New Nation"""" magazines, the """"Nationalist Educational Association"""" and pushed their totalitarian dogma in their """"Nationalism"""" clubs worldwide, including in Germany, and that the bible of their movement, Edward Bellamy's book """"Looking Backward"""" was translated into every major language including the languages of those countries that became home to totalitarian socialism and the socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part) under the National Socialist German Workers' Party (21 million dead), the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (62 million dead), and the Peoples' Republic of China (35 million dead).  It is easy to see why anyone would want to cover all of that up, but it should not be covered up.

In the USA, the Bellamy dogma supported a government takeover of education.  The government's schools imposed segregation by law and taught racism as official policy.  The USA's behavior was an example for three decades before the Nazis. As under Nazism, the Jehovah's Witnesses, and blacks and the Jewish and others in the USA attended government schools that dictated segregation, taught racism, and persecuted children who refused to perform the straight-arm salute and robotically chant the Pledge. Some kids were expelled from government schools and had to use the many better alternatives.  There were acts of violence. When Jesse Owens competed in the 1936 Olympics in Germany, his neighbors attended segregated government schools where they saluted the flag with the Nazi salute.  The U.S. practice of official racism even outlasted the horrid party.  And the schools and the Pledge still exist. The Pledge is still the most visible sign of the USA's growing police state.  

After segregation in government's schools ended, the Bellamy legacy caused more police-state racism of forced busing that destroyed communities and neighborhoods and deepened hostilities.

Bellamy was a self-proclaimed national socialist in the USA, with the """"Nationalist"""" magazine, and he preached what he called """"military socialism.""""  The federal flag darkens schools because Bellamy wanted government to take over all schools and to eliminate all of the better alternatives.  Worse, Bellamy wanted the government to take over everything, not just schools. He wanted the government to impose the military system on all of society. School flags are a symbol of  nationalization, militarism, and socialism.

The Bellamy dogma was the same dogma that led to the """"Wholecaust"""" (of which the Holocaust was a part): 62 million killed under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 35 million under the Peoples' Republic of China; 21 million under the National Socialist German Workers'",0.0

Let's start from the beginning and move towards what we have. There was a boy who was born in 1805 who founded a religion. That in and of itself isn't that special. Lots of people started their own religions and churches. But he is different. He isn't just any religionist because he claims that he actually speaks with God face-to-face like prophets anciently. He claims that he received Golden Plates and he translated them by the power of God into the Book of Mormon. He claims to hold the keys to salvation. He claims that his is the only church that acts with real authority from God, and that all the other churches are imposters. Aren't you interested in what arguments have been made about whether or not he is a real prophet? If Joseph Smith merely claimed to be able to predict a few things, that would be one thing. But when a young boy claims incredible visions and revelations, comparable only to a handful of previous prophet's experiences, that is something else.  30 June 2005 00:45",0.0

Taking a second look at it, I don't think that the phrase """"express reservations regarding conclusions reached in the 9/11 Commission Report"""" is accurate.  That seems pretty watered down considering that they come right out and say they think it was a controlled demolition.  From their own About page:

""""The World Trade Center building... were destroyed not by jet impact and fires but by controlled demolition with explosives""""  

I checked the first 15 or so references in the article and the one cited appears to be the only way that phrases it this way.  The other ones seem to be much more direct in what this organization is advocating.

For example, BBC News says: 

""""However, a group of architects, engineers and scientists say the official explanation that fires caused the collapse is impossible. Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth argue there must have been a controlled demolition.

""""The founder of the group, Richard Gage, says the collapse of the third tower is an obvious example of a controlled demolition using explosives

"""" 'Building Seven is the smoking gun of 9/11. A sixth grader can look at this building falling at virtually freefall speed, symmetrically and smoothly, and see that it is not a natural process.' """"

I suggest the following:

""""Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth, founded in 2006, is a non-profit organization representing architects and engineers which advocates that the World Trade Center was destroyed by explosive demolition, a 9/11 conspiracy theory.""""

Or if you really want the 9/11 Commission report in the lead sentence:

""""Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth, founded in 2006, is a non-profit organization representing architects and engineers which rejects the conclusions reached in the 9/11 Commission Report about the September 11 attacks.

Thanks Ta'olunga for giving Anacrossan some light....lol.. Yes Mr Mariner wrote about Nuku'alofa Fort as he was part of 'Ulukalala's forces that destroy the Nuku'alofa Fort...

Mr Mariner book was published in 1817, nine years before Mr Thomas arrived and recorded events and developed the Old Tongan alphabet as shown with the Bible Old publish or how the old people say in Tongan, koe paaki motu'a.

Mr Vason arrived with 10 missionaries from the London Missionary Society in 1797, he stayed in Tonga for four years where he recorded Mumui as King, Tuku'aho installation and murder, while staying with Mulikiha'amea he also recorded and describe the Mulikiha'amea's Household, the beginning of the Civil War and how Muliki Ha'amea was killed. Mr Vason book was first published in 1810 with later published edition.

Nuku'alofa were recorded over the years before Tongan alphabet and to the modern Tongan alphabet as these:

1797 published in 1810: Noogollefa by George Vason, first Missionary. 

1817: Nioocalofa by William Mariner

Post 1826: Nukualofa by Mr Thomas Old published document.

1842: Noukou-Alofa by Father Chevron, first Catholic Missionary.

Post 1945: Nuku'alofa by the modern Tongan alphabet.

Anacrossan claim is unsupported and she has to remember that Taufa’ahau was in Ha’apai as King and his first recorded to visit to Nuku’alofa by the Missionaries were in March 1827, Nuku’alofa were already recorded 17 years before when Vason’s book was published in 1810.

THIS IS MY REPLY TO YOU THAT YOU HAVE DELETED ACTING AS A FASCIST FROM THE DISCUSSION ON NICOSIA PAGE:

Nicosia and discrimination against Greek contributors and the Greek character of the cityDear Salvio,

You have accused me of abusive behaviour against other users and consequently blocked me from editing the article on Nicosia for a 24 hour period.

May I draw to your attention that it is fairly obvious that those three users namely Seb az86556 , Seric2 and Chesdovi are clearly constantly creating a picture of Nicosia as a decadent muslim city that serves their religious beliefs and are all clearly hailing form Turkish backgrounds.

There is a constant undermining of the city´s Greek identity i.e. whenever a Greek flag appears in any single picture the aforementioned users delete that picture instantaneously and prefer to throw in pictures of the flag of """"shame"""" and occupation that is equivalent to a legalisation of a human crime of continuous brutal occupation of the island of Cyprus by the Turkish army.

The Greek flag is OMNIPRESENT in the Republic of Cyprus whether some people like it or detest it but this is the reality and an Encyclopedia that wishes to be UNBIASED should depict the REALITY and not the subjective views of a minority of readers that are furthermore based on extremist religious and nationalistic views. On the other hand, such users do find it appropriate to throw in pictures using the Turkish and the ILLEGAL, yes illegal according to United Nation referendums flat of the non-recognised internationally illegal self-proclaimed state of the so-called TRNC.

It is totally UNACCEPTABLE to have extremist nationalistic individuals, that strategically reached the level of administrators, deteriorating all the time the article on the city of Nicosia, promoting an unrealistic Turkish character and undermining the Greek character of the city AND at the same time having an ADDITIONAL article on """"North Nicosia"""" that is depicting a totally FALSE picture w.r.t the city. The TRNC is illegal, not recognised by any state other than Turkey and some terrorist states that are non-democratic and yet Wikipedia has a page on Northern Nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of Cyprus. This is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on Northern Nicosia stressing how Turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for Nicosia and emphasize the Turkish character of the city, talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the Greek character.

This is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable Greek character of the area controlled by the Republic of Cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the Republic of Cyprus the mere fact that Wikipedia has a site that is CONSTANTLY vandalised by several ethnic Turkish extremists and Wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour.

In the light of all of this, I shall stop contributing to Wikipedia as I consider it downgrading for my own self. Furthermore, I do not wish to participate in an """"encyclopedic"""" project that is totally biased and discriminatory.

 When will Man be ready to accept that our Time is not the Time of the Universe? 

http://www.fitinizini.com/theories_01.html

Theory of Multi-Dimensional Scalable Worlds
By Dr. Fortunato Da COSTA in Theory of Multi-Dimensional Scalable Worlds * 

""""When will Man be ready to accept that our Time is not the Time of the Universe?"""" 

Principle I – Empiric – Entity and World Scale relationship: 
In the Universe each Entity (constellation, star, planet, animal, vegetable, micro organism, molecule, …) belongs to its own WORLD SCALE defined by two major dimensions the LIFE SCALE (Average Life Time Scale) and the SPACE SCALE (Average Size Scale) of the Entity. 

Principle II – Empiric – The fulfillment principle: 
Each particular Entity, in its Space Scale, has everything needed to complete its life cycle and in its respective Life Scale there is enough time to, also, complete its life cycle with success. 

Principle III – Empiric – World Scales existence: 
According to our human kind World Scale there is an undetermined number of Smaller World Scales below us – microorganisms, molecules, atoms, … – and another undetermined number of Larger World Scales above us – planets, stars, constellations, .... 

Principle IV – Empiric – Time and Space Relationship: 
The Life Scale is directly proportional to the Space Scale. As smaller the Space Scale of an Entity as small it is the respective Life Scale of that Entity. 
Nature clearly shows that there is a relationship between Life Scales and Space Scales – the empiric observation demonstrates that the absolute life time of a planet is much longer than of a human. And the absolute life time of a human is much longer than of a butterfly – so, there is an evident empiric relationship between Time and Space that we humans never saw and took into scientific consideration. 
Example of an empiric formula that can be applied: 

Life_Scale = K x Space_Scale 
( K ~ 30 years/meters for mammals ) 

Principle V – Empiric – Imaginary Multidimensional Worlds existence: 
In Euclid’s geometry, if we consider ourselves a point in a plan, we only can observe just a line: this means that if we are a point in a two dimensions world, we only can percept one dimension. 
The same rule can be extrapolated to understand that if we are an Entity in a four dimensions World Scale (X, Y, Z, and Time) there is, at least, another extra dimension that we cannot see or understand its existence because it is not possible to percept it from the World Scale where we are in. Only using the imaginary complex number i=(-1) ½ it is possible to mathematically define that imaginary dimension from the World Scale where we do belong. 
This takes us to the conclusion that multidimensional Worlds DO exist and we are part of Multidimensional Worlds with, at least, an extra dimension that we cannot observe or understand, because they are imaginary to us: i=(-1) ½. 

Principle VI – Empiric – Relative Intelligence and Relative Perspective: 
Can we ask to a blind born human the reason why the sea is blue? If the Entity does not percept the atmosphere color dimension, because it was never a Real Dimension in its World Scale, it is not possible for him to justify that phenomenon. The Entity only can make that justification if he is capable of creating a mathematical model where the sky color dimension is introduced as an imaginary dimension i=(-1) ½. 
So, we have to introduce two new concepts: the Relative Perspective and the Relative Intelligence. 
RELATIVE PERSPECTIVE is the set of Real Dimensions that the Entity cans percept from its World Scale. 
RELATIVE INTELLIGENCE is the capability of the Entity to understand, to predict and to make use of phenomena happening inside its World Scale’s Relative Perspective. By this principle all entities are rational and intelligent in their respective Relative Perspective Referentials. 
So, the Human Kind or any other Entity, only can justify the scientific phenomena that are totally functions of Dimensions that are Real (and not Imaginary) in the World Scale of that Entity. Unless the Entity is intelligent enough to extrapolate its relative perspective using imaginary dimensions, i=(-1) ½, in their mathematical models. 

Principle VII – Empiric – The Extra Imaginary Dimension existence principle: 
Why our Planet Earth has to change its rotation routines? Why there are Gravitational Forces that should approach the macrocosms but, instead, the cosmos is splitting itself? How can we justify scientific phenomena that we cannot understand? Obviously there is, at least, an extra imaginary dimension that we cannot percept or understand from our World Scale (X, Y, Z, and Time) that relates the different MULTI-DIMENSIONAL WORLD SCALES above and",0.0

Randy, I am not apologizing to you for an obvious joke, so you will have to somehow manage to go on without one. What is truly outrageous is how little you care about the """"embarrassing"""" state of the article (not my words, but those of several editors above), but you care a great deal about making sure there are indents, and tildes, and every one of your trite, nonsensical, kangarroo-court rules has been followed. I am sure your mother is very proud of your Wikipedia J.D. law degree, but you are not getting any more of my time to contribute to your project and correct your obvious falsehoods and text that does not clearly appear to have been written by an English speaker familiar with Heidegger and able to name even a few of his main concepts. Please point me to the place in the article where even one of H's primary philosophical concepts are reasonably explained, so that a reader may have any idea of what he is after. The current page leaves everyone less intelligent and knowledgeable than they were before reading it. I promise you, that you are not getting even one minute more of my time in any event.  This article is so bad that it needs to be gone through paragraph by paragraphy and replaced my new content. Nearly every paragraph in it leaves the reader knowing less true things about Heidegger than the reader knew before. If you would like to actually know something about Heidegger, read the article I wrote. I managed to explain in the lead the main ideas which one needs to know about Heidegger. The current article does not even succesfully explain Heidegger's thought or his importance within the entire article, and inculcates a number of gross and vulgar misconceptions. It would be almost impossible to imagine a philosophy article that was filled with more sophmoric drivel, and reads like a machine-translated text of an undergraduate who has never read the author, and wishes to spread as much misinformation as possible. If you prefer reading an article that seems to claim that Heidegger has only been read in France and is unable to successfully name or explain EVEN A SINGLE ONE OF HEIDEGGER'S CONCEPTS, please by all means, waste your time on doing so. I am finished with this. Adieu.   """,0.0

Direct from the House of Zig
Suzanne Carbone and Lawrence Money
The Age, November 15, 2006

WHATEVER happened to Zig, the disgraced half of the famous Melbourne clowns? Doug McKenzie, the better half, turned up his curly toes two years ago but Diary has not heard a word about Zig, Jack Perry, until now, although we're none the wiser if he's still with us. Diary had a call from South Melbourne: the Salvos store in Clarendon Street has been selling his stuff. Kitchen chairs, a bedroom dresser with mirror, two bedside cabinets, all optimistically marked: """"heritage"""" and """"Once belonged to Zig the Clown"""".

The lady at the counter said she had never heard of Zig and Zag but the """"men who collected it said that was where it came from"""".

You remember the tragic saga: after four decades of frolicking with the kids, starring in Moomba and on ankle-biter television, Zig and Zag were finally made Moomba monarchs in 1999 but the reign was over before it began. Suddenly it was revealed that, years before, Zig had pleaded guilty to child molestation and he (and, hence, hapless Zag) was dethroned. Zig and Zag never spoke to each other again. If still alive, Zig would be 89 now.

I'm arguing for the page to state that Artpop received general positive reviews with a disclaimer afterwards that states that the reception has been more ambivalent than her past works. STATic has been engaged in this debate for months and has admitted twice that he dislikes Lady Gaga and even made fun of her and her fans, which obviously constitutes WP:Bias. Homeostasis has previously been blocked from editing due to his unprofessional behavior on Gaga pages and has recently admitted that he's been accused numerous times of bias against the artist in question.

A merger is probably a good idea.  First, the prehistoric man article is terrible.  In fact it shouldn't exist as anything other than a stub.  The term """"Prehistoric man"""" is no longer used by scholars and hasn't been since the 1970's becuase it is androcentric and because there really is no such thing as a group or type of people who are characteristically """"prehistoric"""".  In other words, people in prehistoric societies have no particualar commonalities except a lack of writing.  Prehistory is a rubric used by scholars to differentiate the methods used to study the past, not a type of people.  There is no such thing as a stage of personhood or social development in which a person is a prehistoric man or woman.  For example, the Inca remained a prehistoric people until the Spanish conquest and yet they ruled one of the most impressive empires on earth and still had no writen records (quipa were memory aids, not writing).  In Central America, the prehistoric period starts more than a thousand years earlier.  Further, the term is Eurocentric and based on the notion of progressive stages of """"mankind"""" like the """"stone age"""".  There are people who still use stone tools.  The """"ages as stages"""" concepts have long since been abandoned in the social sciences since they do not apply universally and can not be tied directly to other political and social developments around the world.

"Lugnuts is merely stating this can be done, even, if you like, can be gotten away with. I think 1ragincajun's question was more concerned than just wondering about what is possible or not. In Wikipedia film articles I've come across ridiculous, tiny detail by detail plot synopses from beginning right through to the very end. And, yes, that's 'allowable', but can be very annoying to many. The problem further is that then there may be no real in depth discussion of the film beyond giving the structure of the plot away, leaving a shallow, spoiling article.

So I was a bit relieved to find the current Norwegian Wood synopsis.  It doesn't seem to have been suggested much, though ideal would be for films to have a separate full plot Wikipedia page, containing the full synopses first also. It would leave it possible for people who haven't seen a film to read the main film article page without having to learn of what happens through to the end.

Anyway, ideally, I agree with 1ragincajun. Isn't it possible to be a bit more vague about the development, including something like - 'the hero's life develops with these 2 love interests in an emotionally tight film involving tragedy'? Just a thought.",0.0

 Is this map accurate? =

I see some problems with this map:

1- It seems to me that this map only shows the very first homo-sapiens immigrations, not the further ones... 

1a- For example, regarding New Zealand, this map shows the islands being occupied by melanesian peoples that I suppose to be the morioris, while we know the maoris (the ones who come after the morioris and decimated them) were actually Polinesian... 

1b- Europe is shown being occupied by settlers from Anatolia, those were the certainly the Paleo-Europeans... This map does not show the further occupation of Europe by the Indo-Europeans who originated in the Caspian Basin, migrated to Europe and pushed the Paleoeuropeans westards and southwards.

1c- The Brazilian Amerindians are not of Colombian ancestry, they are either of Caribbean origin (the Caribs and Arawaks) or of Paraguayan-Northern-Argentine origin (the Tupi-Guaranis).  The bulk of the Amerindians who were in Brazil about the time of the arrival of the Portuguese were these Tupi-Guaranis.  They came from Paraguay and spread all over the Brazilian coast till the valley of the Amazon River.  When you show a map where Brazilian Amerindians are all coming from Colombia, you are showing a totally contradictory information. 

1d- The Dravidians reached India from Ethiopia to Yemen, from Yemen to Oman, from Oman to Southeast Iran, from Southeast Iran to the Valley of Indus.  What is shown on that map is that the route of the occupation of India by the Indo-Europeans (from Iran through Bactria).

1e- The hipothesis of ancient waves of Paleoeuroepan settling in the eastern coast of North America is ignored, while some geneticists have found evidences of that due to the existance of the Mithocondrial gene """"X"""" (""""Xenia"""") among North-American Native Americans.

1f- This map also seems to ignore the Australoid migrations to South America, some people claim that the Australoids have reached South America before the Mongoloids due to some archeological findings in Brazil.

Anyways, I believe it should be explained that the migrations of the homo-sapiens show on that map are only the first, the early migrations, and the route of their early settling in India should be corrected.  

Also, I would suggest a second map, showing further homo-sapiens migrations (now including the Maori migration from Polinesia, the correct migrations in South America and the settling of the Indo-Europeans in Europe.

    obsolete English handicap, a game in which forfeit money was held in a cap, from hand in cap"""", which obviously has nothing at all to do with being """"Handy with a cap"""" or even related to the disabled.

So now you've changed your story of The Hours for the third time, eh? (Or is it fourth? Fifth? I seem to be losing count as you approach the limits of my pitifully deficient arithmetic.) If I, er, comprehend it correctly, the latest draft of The Hours has it that you originally """"thought"""" five hours was """"about"""" two hours. Interesting.  And revealing. In fact you sniffily dismissed the interval as """"less than 2 hours"""" (my emph.). Interesting and revealing because? Because the open-ended """"about"""" tends to support a story of an innocent """"estimate"""".  But """"less than"""" doesn't. """"Less than"""" is specifically limited. Narrowed in focus, specific, it's more clearly a calculated (no pun intended) lie. It's well-known that most liars have trouble remembering which lie they told. Less well-known is the fact that their use of words, trivial though words seem to them, often gives them away. Freudian slips? Elementary, my dear Watson.

 Khalifa Ezzat sourcing 

AHLM13, I took a quick glance at this article and there are some sourcing problems that existed from before your edits.  You added a couple of sources in the education section and I appreciate that.  I removed an existing source () which is a blog and those rarely make good sources for Wikipedia.  See the WP:SPS page for blogs in general.  For material about a living person (often called WP:BLP here), blogs are even more restricted for their use - see the WP:BLPSPS page.  On top of that, going to that page gives an error message and there really doesn't look like that blog has anything.  I've removed the blog (used twice as a source).  Any chance you might know of a better source for what the blog was used for?  I think it was the last two sentences in the lead.  

I'd love to find some sourcing for the rest - where the articles were published and ISBN numbers for the translations and books would be awesome.  If you know of any, would you mind adding it?  Even just bare links or raw ISBN and I can clean it up later.   """,0.0

Permanent Resident Alien - An alien admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident. Permanent residents are also commonly referred to as immigrants; however, the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) broadly defines an immigrant as any alien in the United States, except one legally admitted under specific nonimmigrant categories (INA section 101(a)(15)). An illegal alien who entered the United States without inspection, for example, would be strictly defined as an immigrant under the INA but is not a permanent resident alien. Lawful permanent residents are legally accorded the privilege of residing permanently in the United States. They may be issued immigrant visas by the Department of State overseas or adjusted to permanent resident status by the Department of Homeland Security in the United States.Permanent Resident Alien Definition

 Polyspermy 

Before you revert the stable version - please discuss this first on the talk page. As for your question:
Look at the beginning of the third line. The Talmud quotes the verse from 1 Samuel 17, 4, which goes as follows: """"And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines"""", right? Now, look at your Bible - ibid., and see the full verse: """"And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath..."""". Right?
So, the Talmud quotes the verse about Goliath, and then: interprates this verse - using a pun - in the following way (see the Talmud ibid. in that third line): """"One hundred foreskins of Philistines - got her [i.e. his mother] pregnant"""". In other words: the Talmud explains, that the biblical words """"And there went out a champion"""" - mean:  """"And there was created/born a champion"""", and it also explains that the biblical words: """"out of the camp of the Philistines"""", mean: """"out of a hundred foreskins of Philistines"""". Note that this fantastic interpretaion made by the Talmud - is based on a pun: the word for """"camp"""" is similar to (i.e. sounds like) """"a hundred foreskins"""" (not in English of course). Note also that fantastic interpretaions for the Bible - are very common in the Talmud.
Now, look ibid. at the next line (i.e. the fourth line); The Talmud now explains how - having so many fathers - is really possible from a biological point of view, so the Talmud continues: """"Rav Matania said: no controversy over that; as long as the sperm [of the first man] hasn't gotten rotten [in the woman's body] yet, a woman can get pregnant by two men - all at once"""".
Notice that all of the Talmud's commentators explain all of this - as I did.
Hope this helps. Anyway, next time, please consult pefore you revert the stable version.

 Ownership of articles 

Hi, this is Marxus, sorry, I don't know how to use those phrases and didn't know how to use them at all. I will try to now since you have told me. You see, I wrote many articles on Richard Brautigan novels such as A Confederate General From Big Sur, The Hawkline Monster: A Gothic Western, Willard and His Bowling Trophies: A Perverse Mystery, Sombrero Fallout: A Japanese Novel, Dreaming of Babylon: A Private Eye Novel 1942, and An Unfortunate Woman: A Journey. For the novels The Hawkline Monster, Willard and His Bowling Trophies, Sombrero Fallout, and Dreaming of Babylon, I don't like when someone else changes what I have written. They create that thing on the right hand side of the novel pages about more information, I don't like that. Especially since there is no pictures on top it makes the article look bad. And I am sorry about the vandalism but I just want people changing my articles and when I change it back it goes back to the one I didn't like. I thank you for your information but please can you make that stop though and I am not trying to be rude or anything I am just asking my articles to be the way I would like them is all. Thank you and please respond.

Please note that you do not own any article; no article on Wikipedia is your article, even if you created it and are the only person who has edited it. So let me strongly suggest that you step back and think before using the phrase """"my article"""" again. Trying to justify your vandalism on the basis that someone does something that you don't like is about the weakest excuse possible. If you continue this kind of editing, let me assure you that you will be blocked.   """,0.0

I'm very hurt my daughter was brought up here.

Well, dear Ahasuerus: It is actually difficult to edit any page in Wikipedia without Muslims jumping at you and trying to censor you with all sorts of excuses. You must understand that the freedom of speech for Muslims is an alien concept. In Islamic countries if you say something against Islam they kill you. Where they can't kill you, they censor you. Wikipedia seems to be dominated by Muslims. This of course is not true in all the pages where Muslims have no interest, but when the interest of Islam comes in, they can be quite bullish in making their word prevail. But that is another story. This article started with some explanation like this:

In recent years especially after the 9/11 some observers, including Muslim dissidents have stated that Islam presents a threat bigger than Nazism not to just the Western world but to all non-Islamic countries. They have labeled those who defend Islam and try to be politically correct about it, the today’s useful idiots. 

[Ali Sina] states: “They are idiots because they speak without knowledge of Islam and its threat to mankind and they are useful to the Islamists with whose help they can penetrate the non-Muslim countries and destroy them from within.”  The same author writes: “More abhorrent than war is making peace with evil. In the words of the 18th Century British parliamentarian Edmund Burke, """"All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing."""" Those who advocate peace with Islam are idiots of this century. If we do not stand against Islam it will grow and then billions will die. Trying to appease Muslims is foolish. It is informed by ignorance of Islam. Most cancers are treatable, if detected in time. But if ignored, they will grow to a stage that will kill you. Today we have the choice. We can either fight Islam and extirpate it before it threatens our existence or wait and face the apocalypses.” 

Muslims obviously don't like Ali Sina. For some reason anything you post here from him they will delete at once. So the above passage that explained the concept was deleted. The administrator SlimVirgin despite claiming impartiality, has yet to show that in actions. I could be wrong but for reasons that I explained to her, I have still to be convinced of that claim. I found out that she is Iranian, like Ali Sina, but of course most Iranians are still Muslims. She even once tried to discredit Ali Sina saying that he is Islamophobic. Obviously she sees genuine criticism of Islam unwarranted and interprets that as Islamophobia. My judgement about her is just based on my first impression and I could be wrong. I have explained to her my concern about her impartiality already and I hope she will eventually show I had misjudged her. 

In Wikipedia there is a lot of Islamic propaganda which are not true at all, but generally critical views about Islam do not survive. Why? If Wikipedia is impartial shouldn’t we give equal space to both sides? Would we accept if e.g. scientologist or any other cultists try to take over the Wikipedia and disallow any criticism of their cult? What is happening is very disturbing. There are hundreds of pages in Wikipedia that are misleading because they are edited and controlled by Muslims and as soon as you try to post anything showing the other side of the coin they revert it and even call your contribution “hate speech”. What about the Quran? Isn’t that book a hate speech?  

Funny thing is that they throw at you the basic rules of Wikipedia when in reality it is they who constanly breach those rules. 

If you try to write anything that Muslims don’t like they will delete it with invalid justifications. This is a very disturbing trend. For example the quotes of Ali Sina were removed because, as they said, he is not notable. There are 200,000 pages talking about faith freedom international. There have been death threats in Islamic sites against him, there are a few Islamic sites created just to refute him. Doesn’t all that say that he is notable at least to be quoted? Finally if he is notable enough to have a page in Wikipedia why his quotes should not be published? 

I am not familiar with the structure of Wikipedia, but I suppose there must be some committee that would check into complaints. (All I am hoping is that this committee is not already taken over by Islamists)  Is there a forum where important questions such as the direction Wikipedia is taking is discussed? 

Sorry, this subject might have not belonged to this page but these are things I would like to discuss. Is there a place to do that?  My point is that if Wikipedia loses its impartiality and becomes the guardian angel of a certain cult or religion, it loses its credibility fast.  05:13 2",0.14285714285714285

""" has existed on all continents. And because it is a general name, it should reflect general details rather than anything specific. This is basically why the term prehistoric religion is not used, because it is too general.   
Oh yeah and origin of religion is very precise.  I'm still waiting for a better title.  
yes origin of religion is not precise, this is why I changed the name to """"Evolutionary theories on the origin of religion"""". However if evolution is accepted as fact, then teleological arguments on the origin of religion cannot be considered scientific, in which case the evolutionary theories on the origin of religion and """"origin of religion"""" are the same.   
First of all I have told you a thousand times already that actual evolutionary theories on the origin of religion are like those of Boyer, Wolpert and Dawkins and they are miles away from what you have been writing about.  Also the logic you present above is simply not correct at all.  The fact that human physiology is a product of biological evolution does not mean that the origin of religion can be explained through evolutionary mechanisms or as a product of biological evolution.  Perhaps without the evolution of certain cognitive capacities human practices like religion would not be possible, but the origin of religion itself may be entirely """"social"""" or """"cultural"""" given a certain state of cognitive evolution.  If that were the case then theories of religion's origin would not be evolutionary theories at all, yet they would be equally """"scientific"""" and clearly non-religious in nature.  That is to say biological evolution itself is not necessarily causal of religion, even if it may be necessary to create a certain precondition (e.g. a capacity for symbolic thought) for religious belief.  

content dispute
We have a content dispute that is mainly between myself and you. Dbachmann occasionaly gets involved switching between sides. But essentially this is between me and you. This is why we are not making progress, because we do not have any editors who are willing to dedicate the time and effort to work on this this. Consequently you are taking advantage of this lack of editors and you are using an old AFD as your leverage, because you can run to any admin, who only know the rules and know little about content. This is unfair and unacademic and is very political. Dbachmann knows very well that the articles I created are valid. He has admitted that he agrees in principal with the ideas I have presented, but simply disagrees with me because he dislikes my demeanor User_talk:Dbachmann#origin_of_religion. I had worked on the article """"Origin of language"""" using the same approach. Before I started working on the origin of language, the topic was approached from a psychological or sociological perspective filled with archaic fringe and opinionated theories. I proceeded to add the evolutionary perspective to the article, after which Dbachmann reviewed the article with some refactoring he upgraded the article to B-class. I used the same approach on the origin of religion only to be met with some of the worst hostility to knowledge. As I often mention, you had even disputed the out of Africa hypothesis, or that grave goods are considered evidence of a belief in the afterlife . Here you are seen to be making up your own theories. So I do feel justified to doubt the credibility of some of your assertions and also some of the other editors. I have always asked admins and a lot of other editors to assist in dispute resolution, but many seem content with pushing buttons and chasing after vandals and boosting their egos by blocking people, they have no interest in content. So I propose to go for dispute resolution, if you think you have a case, you should opt for it. If you are afraid and want to continue using the archaic AFD as your silver bullet, then this dispute will needlessly continue. Of course the result will be blocks of which I am the top candidate, but what a waste that would be. Who would be there to provide education on grave goods.   
You've not described a content dispute but simply congratulated yourself, dismissed the behavioral policing of admins, and fabricated behavior on my part.

 dromos festival 

Hi,

I keep trying to give a definition of our new festival called dromos festival. It's a festival that is supposed to encourage active involvement from local communities, t is a not for profit festival that is funded by the state in the UK via Arts Council England. We're not trying to advertise but trying to describe the whole ethos of the festival which is participation. In it's inaugural year it is still trying to find its identity so we don't have a huge definition except for """"get involved"""". I apologise if this is constituting as advertising, but the festival is meant to create a platform for artists to present their work in different communities. Is their anything I can do in this circumstance that wouldn't constitute the page as an advert? The festival is also run each year by 5 young producers to increase their skills in producing and to help them find work after the project and it aims to do that year on year.

Really look forward to hearing from you and all the best
Martin

They intervene in any Balkan history and politics related  article, pushing Greek POV, launch edit wars,  and repeated reverts of  vandalized by them versions, permanent deletions, block users, merges and redirects to deletetion of undesired new articles. Their main target is to distort all articles lelated to  ISLAM, TURKEY, REBUBLIC OF MACEDONIA, BULGARIA, ALBANIA (CHAMERIA), THEIR MINORITIES IN GREECE AND THEIR HISTORY. They attack  every article criticizing Greece transforming it  to Greekish propaganda POV. They became maniacs in optimizing dark side of Greek history.They communicate each other by secret e-mails avoiding messages through their talk pages to avoid publicity. This group acting in a systematic way to revert articles, when one of member makes the limit of 3 reverts, one another continues with 4th revert to avoid punishment for violating 3rv rule.

Furthermore they are suspected agents of Greek National Intelligence Service (E.Y.Π.

As you are aware, anything that i do gets reverted for no reason mainly by you; you use the WP:3RR the WP:SOCK and that stupid conciseness rubbish for your protection when really you know you are just doing it to be difficult and generally annoying. 

As i saw at the top of your page, and i quote from another twit that You are doing nothing to improve the article by constantly reverting - this occuring regularly in the following:

Louise Henriette de Bourbon-Conti - probably the best example of your obsession with having everything that way you want it; 
Henrietta Anne Stuart - i rearranged the page and added the Template:House of Stuart - clearly a tragedy;
Louise Marie Adélaïde de Bourbon-Penthièvre‎ - added titles and styles - where are they; i even tried to compromise by removing the stlyes and putting back the titles but once again you must have your way;
Victoire of France‎ - changed the awful layout along with her sister Princess Louise-Marie of France and Princess Marie Adélaïde of France 

Why?

The latter is quite amusing to me proving that you dont even read the article - you simply revert back because I did it - all I did was move the Template:House of Bourbon (France) to a different part of the page! Then you and your chronic arrogance go and revert it under the claim that there are rv excessive, redundant trivia contained in other articles then as always you groan on an on about the usual rubbish with please don't violate WP:3RR or WP:SOCK WHAT IS YOUR POINT ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Shut up!

Where is this claim about the WP:SOCK even from  - another one of your ridiculous  thoughts. I will not back down. 

I have a small bit of advice for you: maybe you should read the WP:OWN article for your own clarification on the matter. You really are a bore; and a selfish one at that.

Sure our paths will meet again - Happy editing",0.2857142857142857

Get this, they have 2 pumpers, 1 mini pumper, 1 tanker, 1 ladder truck, and 1 rescue truck from the city.... AS WELL AS 1 pumper, 1 mini pumper, and 1 rescue from the southern door fire dept...... And they have only started (as of this writing) to try and put it out!!!!! Even then, there are only 3 people actively fighting the fire - the rest are just standing around WATCHING!!!

WHAT.... THE..... F***!?!?!?!?!?! When did the fire dept turn wimps??? And WHY are the citizens paying for all these firefighters when they're not doing anything???

Hello! 
But I didn't find excuses I just mentioned that it is quite strange for me to hear that I need to improve my English (but I write historical articles mainly not technical). As I am not a native speaker in English I should improve it for sure, of course. Your example illustrates not the grammar mistakes or errors (this almost never happened) but use of the words which should be fully adequate to context. With this I can agree indeed because I translate texts from Russian into English sometimes directly. In Russian article the original phrase was """"strengthened turret armour"""" [means that it was more thick than hull armour and turret side armour].

 FISHERQUEEN ( Actually A TRASHY DUSTBIN ) IS BLOCKED IN LIFE FOREVER AND FOR LIFE INDEFINITELY 

 FISHERQUEEN IS ACTUALLY A TRASHY DUSTBIN WHO IS BLOCKED IN LIFE AND FOR LIFE INDEFINITELY

It can be so obviously seen that you have no life in reality and hence you carry on with editing pages on Wikipedia,which is another big joke, like you. In fact, it is jokers like you that make Wikipedia an unreliable piece of crap that the world laughs on. You thought you can block users who edit articles that are wrongly written to project a """"good"""" image like that C-grade item song sleaze actress Payal Rohatgi. On the account of hello5678, when I edited to write the truth, since I work with the media and knew the actual truth, you did what you knew best - to block accounts and even have the foolish audacity to write that it did not seem I was a journalist. Your block anyways went futile ( like all your remaining blocks on other users go, and future blocks will be going ) since as I had said, there are a million computers to comment and reply from. It just depends on my wish if I want to respond to idle losers like you and whether I have the time to do so. Once and for all, I am doing it this time, and won't remove time for worthless people like you again.
 
You had some advice on how I should spend my """"blocked time"""" by reading WP:Dispute pages on Wikipedia so that I have better ideas on dealing with disputes. Actually ,you need better ideas to deal with life. I am not foolish like you to spend any amount of my time bothering about rubbish written by stupid people like you who have no work in real life and spend days editing pages on Wikipedia/ Scribblebook that no one bothers to read. Some people are just unfortunate like you and 2over0. And if you are troubled by my calling that actress """"sleazy"""", then that's your problem. Cos that's the only work she has done and the press uses precisely that term while referencing her work. You also spoke about writing """"accurate"""" information on wikipedia. Ironic, when you don't even bother finding out what is accurate, and spend endless hours blocking, and acting admin as if it is an important position in your life. Oh wait, that may be the only position you probably have or will have ever in your unfortunate life.
 
Carry on with your scribble game. And if you feel threatened by media exposure, then that shows you knew you were wrong. It's only when people are wrong that they feel threatened. Pity your personality. Also, you ended by writing that """" it's clear you aren't a journalist, and have no means of carrying out your threat """" - LOL. Sad, that you lived in that illusion. For JOKERS like you who are totally idle,and who scribble away in virtual pages on Wiki-scribble-pedia, will obviously withdraw from the truth. You yourself have no idea at all if I am a journalist, and you write that it's clear that I am not. Well, you are also inane and a clown to fool yourself. I had all means, and the said article has already been published. I had NO TIME to let you know, since I am a busy person, unlike you and do not find time to come scribble on virtual pages that clowns like you , 2OVERO, 2/0, AKERANS, MANAGERARC, FISHERQUEEN (yeah, we named you again - Suck it up),  KURU etc. do all your life. You will find that information, depending on which Godforsaken part of the world you live in.  And like last time, you can go ahead and block me this time too. For , no one cares two hoots for your silly blocking games. We do have a life, unlike losers like you. Maybe its time for you to go fish in real life, so that you can come anywhere remotely close to having a life - LOL.
SO, LOSERQUEEN, GROW UP and GET A LIFE, You IDLE CLOWN OR ELSE, YOU WILL REMAIN A LOSER ALL YOUR LIFE. WHO CARES ANYWAY WHAT INANE, PUERILE LOSERS LIKE YOU DO IN THEIR LIVES. Cos all you know best is to play edit and block games on your scribblebook called wikipedia. Scribble on cos anyway no one cares and I most certainly don't. Time for you to go fishing then, LOSERQUEEN. And I wont bother to check any replies or anything else ever, cos I dont have time unlike Idle LOSERS like you, Loserqueen. You are no where near a queen, but certainly are a huge ,filled with trash, dustbin. Pity you, unfortunate daft-LOSER- DUSTBIN.

An event in this article is a March 28 selected anniversary (may be in HTML comment)

From Wikipedia:Village pump:

How many images are too many? I've only ever seen one image. I wanted to add the famous picture of the soldier shot in the head to the Spanish Civil War page, as well as a typical propaganda poster of the times.
 0000 EDT 23 May 2002

IMO, a couple more legal images would be fine.  The article only has 1 image after all.   04:17 23 May 2003 (UTC)

I've recently brought over a lot of new content from the Spanish-language wikipedia. I've done my best to integrate it, but someone may want to take an editorial pass. Also, it seems to me that we ought to have several """"sidebar"""" articles dealing with things like the internal situations in Madrid and Barcelona during the war and there should probably be a lot on Spanish anarchism and the various plitical parties of the time that either exists and should be linked to, or doesn't and should be written.   09:02, 8 Jan 2004 (UTC)

Could someone please explain the communism vs civilization comment in the intro? Thanks. - , 2004-03-14t09:29z
 An atttribution would certainly be nice, and I didn't put it there, but it's certainly on the mark as to how some viewed it. I've seen Hearst Movietone newsreels from the period, and that is pretty much the picture they present. It's also the rhetoric to be found in Franco's speeches during the war. It had very little basis in reality, in my opinion, but leaned heavily on communist atheism and anitclericalism, and the destruction of churches (and  in some cases  torture, murder, etc. of clergy and members of monastic orders) that occurred in the opening weeks of the war. I think the article is accurate in saying that the atrocities in those opening weeks were roughly equal, but the fact that many on the Republican side targeted the Church was endlessly exploited in the Nationalists' rhetoric, and struck a note with conservatives elsewhere who otherwise might have kept more distance from fascism.   17:55, 14 Mar 2004 (UTC)

Pro-Nationalist link
I for one am inclined to keep, for the moment, the recently added Professor Marek Jan Chodakiewicz on The Spanish Civil War. There ought to be at least one external link to a site more sympathetic to the Nationalists than to the Republic. However, I don't think it is a particularly good site: there must be a far more comprehensive presentation of this case (maybe even with some decent footnotes and/or external references itself?) elsewhere on the web. If someone could find a better one and substitute it, I think that would be an improvement.   

 Not Neutral 
I added the note """"The neutrality of this article is disputed."""" because of the insistence in that General Franco or his forces were fascist. This is just communist propaganda. We know better now. Communists wanted to overthrow the legal system of liberties in Spain to create a system similar to that of the Soviet Union. General Franco and his coup prevented that. Of course, the Republican legality was not restored, but that was because it had not proven safe from revolutionary risks. And Monarchy was not restored probably because King Alfonso XIII fled the country only because his partisans lost a municipal ballot, so it appeared to the victors in the war that that king was not reliable to grant individual rights. Of course, Franco's Dictatorship is more than objectionable, but it does not prove that it was a fascist regime.

(this was unsigned, but it's User:Makjavelo

 Frankly, I think this one characterization does not make a non-neutral article. I disagree with much of what Makjavelo has just written, but I do agree with him that the article (or maybe an associated article) might gain from a more extensive explanation of the somewhat complicated relationship of Franco's politics (and Falangism in general) to fascism as such.   17:44, Jun 8, 2004 (UTC)

 This seems like petty apology for Franco, in my opinion. Not only the communists, but the anarchists, socialists and most Republicans refered to the Francoist forces as """"fascist;"""" as well as many historians and authors, e.g. Hemingway. I forget the exact quote, but a Christian clergyman (who were notoriously right-wing at the time, in popular belief) stated that Franco's regime was totalitarian, because he """"controls all aspects of one's life,"""" which can be argued because of the high degree",0.0

The only vandal here is you. Let me clefify some things 4 you,

In the 19th century Ilija Garasanin and the rest of the Serb goverment of that time formed a program called """"Nacertanije"""", it was a plan of how to realize the plan of a Great Serbia  on the ruins of the Ottoman Empire. This new state would be rulled by Serbs, others would be subjected while Muslims(of any ethnicity) would be distroyed(by genocide sense it´s the only way). They called there Army chetnik, them selfs chetniks and there by this ideology(which is fashist) is chetnik. And any1 who follows it is a chetnik.

The plan failed untill 1918 when the Serbs managed to create a """"Slavic Kingdom"""" which was actually ment to become a Serb Kingdom which was with time shown, during WWII the chetniks allied with the Nazis and commited GENOCIDE. After the death of Tito the chetniks ressurected and tried everyting all over again but ones again failed thank God.

Now, the chetnik PROPAGANDA is used to make Serbs think that it is right to do all that and to foole everybothy else, this propaganda includes showing Bosnia as a """"Serb state"""", Bosniaks as  """"Serbs"""", spreding Islamophobia and Anti-Bosniak settlment or presenting the Serbs as the victoms and so on. THAT site does all that and it is enough to open it and you will see. Now you ain´t nobody so I don´t have to proove anything if you don´t see it then you are either stupid or a chetnik your self.

Notability of EiMMN
A tag has been placed on EiMMN, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article seems to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in Wikipedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you feel that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion. To do this, add  on the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag) and leave a note on the article's talk page explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

Without a metatheory, one does not have a truth predicate, which complicates things for realism, because the whole point of that philosophy is that sets really do exist and actually do have the properties ascribed to them. One could argue in favor of a disquotational definition of truth, but that merely pushes the problem around, leading to the same problems as full second-order semantics for arithmetic.   Also, not having a metatheory means that one must treat set theory differently than other branches of mathematics, such as group theory or linear ordering theory. This seems like a difficult distinction to justify. 

I do think that the """"no metatheory"""" interpretation of ZFC (or Zermelian set theory, if you prefer that) is somewhat common, because it is one way of avoiding the issue that what is called V in the object theory cannot be distinguished from a set in the metatheory. One consequence of my original point is that it would also be coherent to interpret this no-metatheory language merely as a way of making statements from the viewpoint of a person inside a particular model of set theory. Moreover, this interpretation is entirely compatible with the viewpoint that there is an objectively-defined collection consisting of all sets, if no additional meta-level principles such as the ability to force over V are added. However, if one already viewed """"all sets"""" as merely a façon de parler with no objective referent, as I think you are proposing, then it's not clear why one sort of disquotation (""""'all sets'"""" = """"all sets"""") is better than another (""""'all sets'"""" = """"all sets in the model at hand""""). — Carl ( · talk) """,0.0

You might be right, only time will tell. However, in any case, I will be me, regardless of what that is, and if Wikipedia can't accept that, it's Wikipedia's loss. I'd love to stick around, and i'd love to find a middle way, but I probably can't do that right now(thus the psuedowiki-break), and I wonder if it'll ever happen with the way things are here at Wikipedia.

In any case, thank you for your message. afist '''''' """,0.0

A Few Things I Wanted to Say
I don't understand why everyone thinks Cockney can only be spoken on the East End.  It seems to be much more of a working or lower class accent found all over London (maybe not """"all over"""", but certainly not just the East End).  If you listen to sound clip for example, you'll hear a man from Peckham.  Peckham is not in the East End, instead it is in South London, and yet he is more Cockney than anyone I have heard in my life.  It says in this article as well that most characters on the sitcom Only Fools and Horses are Cockneys, and yet that takes place where else but in Peckham.  This article also says that Snatch contains Cockney accents and yet Jason Statham who plays one of the main characters in that film and seems to speak with one of those accents, is actually from Sydenham, in south-east London.    

What are some differences between the so-called """"South London"""" (south of the Thames) accent and """"North London"""" accent?  I just find it annoying that locals claim to be able hear differences between the two and yet they never can describe those differences when asked.  It makes one doubt whether such differences even exist.  It's kind of like how New Yorkers claim to be able to distinguish between Bronx accents and Brooklyn accents, Irish New York accents and Italian New York accents, etc., but when asked what those differences are, they can't give you an answer.  It's all b.s. if you ask me.   """,0.0

"Need proper reliable citations 
I appreciate the hardwork of authors in providing references/citations, but most of them dont obey wiki standards like
direct ref to inscriptions and refering to non english sources.

Almost year back I have asked for reliable citations for the claim in this WP that Kota Kings are Kammas,
3 citations have been provided and the funny thing is two of those are famous historian books which
clearly say that Kotas as Rachavaru (kshatriya Rajus) and belong to dhanunjaya gotra. Kota Kings are ancestors to Rajus clans Datla, Dantuluri and Jampana. Plz refer thos two historical books:
1. pg 159-161 from The History of Andhra Country by Yashoda Devi [url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=-d9IAvFOUHsC&printsec;=frontcover&dq;=The+History+of+Andhra+Country]
2. pg 149,159 from A History of the Early Dynasties of Andhradesa, by B.V Krishna Rao 

The two authenticated historical books clearly say Kota Kings as Rachavaru (Rajus), nowhere in the entire two books Kota kings is linked to Kammas.
The third book by Mr. KB Chaudary is unreliable as it is not inline to wiki standards (WP:PRIMARY, WP:OR and WP:SYNTHESIS)
Hence the statements in the article are considered as baseless, and if proper citations are not provided then it shall be cleaned up as per wiki standards.

 about your comment on Elaragirl's talk page 

Hello Dev920, I couldn't help but notice your comments on  talk page under the heading """"Esperanza"""", so I'm sorry if you feel this was an intrusion of your privacy (or Elaragirl's). I wanted to remind you that there is a spectrum of individual editors who claim affiliation with Esperanza, and some editors, how shall I say this? contribute less towards the mainspace than others.  As for the governance issue, I personally don't understand the current structure and I don't feel as if they exert any influence on me at any rate.

I still think that an off-Wikipedia coffee lounge that has an obvious link on Esperanza's page is the best way to satisfy those users who like to spend their time in the lounge, and still address the concerns of those who are opposed to its presence on Wikipedia. What's one more click of the mouse? Just so you know, I had participated a little in the coffee lounge, but I got turned off of it because of the random dog barking and a series of dirty jokes which I felt were sexist, offensive, and not at all belonging on Wikipedia. Because I had participated only to a limited extent, my overall edit count (2971 as of ) wasn't seriously affected when the coffee lounge was deleted.

I had proposed a hypothetical merger between Esperanza, the Kindness Campaign, and Concordia, and while I still think that many of their stated goals overlap, I also feel that Esperanza needs to better define itself before even considering such a merger, and feedback must be solicited from members of all three groups. I was unaware that Esperanza had a prior history of attempting mergers in the past. If you feel that my suggestion was naive and arrogant, chalk it up to my own shortsightedness, not to Esperanza as a whole.

I know that we may differ in our views of what to do with Esperanza, but at least the MfD and in particular comments by you, Elaragirl, and others, have given the impetus for Esperanza to examine itself. Thank you for that.

Since I've typed this much, I might as well invite you to review me at editor review. Thanks again for your participation in all of this.  """,0.0

Those are my reasons.  I'd be interested to hear what people think about all of this.  Am I """"Wikipedia's pornographer""""?

 You are mistaken (again). I am happy to engage in discussion, however it is getting me nowhere in light of your refusal to accept the stark facts, my edit summary is correct, ultimately truth is reflected in legal provisions and legally a reference to the islands of Ireland and U.K. is provided for by the definition """"British & Irish"""" Isles. You were the one who ended the discussion on the topic concerned, with an expression of boredom which suggested to me you had nothing to counter-debate the stark reality of the situation. I will possibly continue making the factual adjustments on your userpage but more infrequently. I don't understand why you won't revert to the legal description, you are letting personality clashes get in the way of facts, egos shouldn't compromise the truth.

I had my eyebrow raised the whole way through this article. The references (practically everything before the 20th century) are suspicious. All the other comments on this discussion page reassure me that my judgment isn't off.

"This is a straw man argument, Mr Merkey.  Nobody is arguing that federally unverified tribes, clans or groups should be identified as having any kind of federal recognition. What's being said here, something that you seem unwilling to accept as even being a valid view, is that those groups claim to have cherokee lineage (in many cases, having verifiable documented evidence to that effect), and as such, they should be figured on the cherokee page, not simply expunged from wikipedia because they don't fall within the very narrow rules defined by the very government that has historically persecuted them. If nothing else, they should be included to highlight the controversy that their claim to being cherokee engenders.  Legally, they may not be recognised cherokees, but anthropologically they are. Removing non federally recognised groups on the basis of some imagined legal threat would seem to be ridiculous; this is intended, after all, to be an encyclopedia, and thus, encyclopedic.  What it's not intended to be is a vanity publishing service, and to remove all reference to non-recognised tribes and the controversy surrounding them would, in my view at least, turn this article into just that.  It certainly wouldn't, as you imply, improve Wikipedia.",0.0

Fair enough.  I seriously thought that Irvine22 was simply being obtuse when he brought that up, as he has a storied history of being obtuse.  If I had thought it was an actual racial epithet then I would never have used it.

Me, I like the idea and feel of dictatorship but when it comes down to real life I'm all for freedom and equality.  I'm really pro-freedom of religion/speech, and yes I'm pro-freedom of speech in what you call the way """"the rest of America"""" believes in it, which is freedom to speak out against anything and not just your way of freedom to speak if your speaking pro-whatever the govt's beliefs happen to be.  Love the hippie movement, by the way, what religion are you going to force everybody to do, and what races are you exactly against?  Also, who exactky are you trying to help with this idea, you and your other insane evil dictator friends, because there are about several billion other people here too who dont appreciate getting every right taken away from them and having somebody try to tell them who they are and what they shuld do and that their dreams aren;t important and that they should be freaking governmant scapegoats and sacrifice their right to speak and everything else jsut so that a group of like a dozen self-absorbed people can get what they want.  Imagine what those billions of people are feeling every day not even being able to freaking have their own indivduality and e=not even being able to live here in peace.  No one came here to live the way other people wanted them to, they came here to live THEIR,note the word THEIR, lives.

Historically, testicle cuffs may have been used by the slave traders of Western Africa, as a means to subdue newly-captured males. In processions to markets, the males were bound to each other in single-file formation, usually by the hands, with ankle manacles in place. The testicle cuffs extended between the legs, and each man was connected to the next by a rope between their genitals. These tight metal bindings on their scrotums were to ensure that a quick pace was kept, for if a man were to stop walking the rope would pull and cause quick, sharp pain in the genital region. doesn't sound vaguely historical, source it or I'll remove it.",0.0

But you know what the funniest part of all this is? I WIN. I literally have about 17 other accounts that have absolutely nothing to do with """"Vost"""", """"ElliotJoyce"""", or """"Accreditor"""", and I've used those accounts to transform Wikipedia articles to match my tastes, which usually means countering the racist garbage from pseudo-intellectual cancers like you sweety. See, from all of the edits I do, you dumb idiots pick up only a fraction to revert- while I've been keeping you busy with Vost socks (which itself is a sock of another account), I've committed over 200 edits under the radar from special-proxy rotations in the last 4 days. I have 2 admin accounts, 5 non-admin accounts of previously active users which I've since been able to commandeer (more on this later), and about 10 standard self-created accounts. What's even more hilarious is that the reverts engendered by my socks usually cause enough notice to the article that I don't even have to do anything to get my views to dominate: I let other users add fuel to the fire that I started. But you know what the absolute kicker to all of this is? I got you, yes you, you Jew-wannabe, black racist cancer smear, to violate numerous Wikipedia policies and your own Wikipedia philosophy by going after me, vendetta style. I BROKE YOU ON YOUR OWN TERMS. And even after all that, my major points and edits prevailed. I win, and considering that your power level on Wikipedia is considerably more entrenched than my own, my victory is that much more devastating. The IP I'm using at the moment, courtesy of the 24-hour computer lab in my dorm, is about 1 of thousands of batch IPs I have access to, which gives me even greater security and privilege to spread myself over Wikipedia in case my special proxy rotation is ever categorized as a proxy, and thus blocked. Oh, and regarding the commandeering of accounts: graphical analysis password bypass and deconstruction (GAPBAD) is a rather effective means to obliterate CAPTCHA; its use is only feasible at specific time intervals when security measures on the target fluctuate or do not register properly. Guess which account is getting targeted next as soon as Wikipedia undergoes its next server hash? ). You've been warned in advance. Just remember: I win. You can't do anything to me.

 MS JACKSON LYRICS 

[Andre 3000]
Yeah this one right here goes out to all the baby's mamas, mamas...
Mamas, mamas, baby mamas, mamas
Yeah, go like this

CHORUS: Andre 3000
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson [OOOH]
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson [OOOH]
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

[Big Boi]
My baby's drama mama, don't like me
She be doin things like havin them boys come from her neighborhood 
to the studio tryin to fight me
She need to get a, piece of the american pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby, and not a paycheck
Private school, daycare shit, medical bills, I pay that
I love your mom and everything, but see I ain't the one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war, my lawyers stay down
She never got a chance 
to hear my side of the story we was divided
She had fish fries and cookouts 
for my child's birthday I ain't invited
Despite it, I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah

CHORUS:
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson [OOOH]
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson [OOOH]
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

[Andre 3000]
Me and your daughter.. got a special thang goin on
You say it's puppy love (arf arf arf)
We say it's full grown (ARF ARF WOOF!)
Hope that we feel this.. feel this way forever
You can plan a pretty picnic
but you can't predict the weather, Ms. Jackson

Ten times out of nine, now if I'm lyin; fine
The quickest muzzle throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing, together dream
bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
on the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever, ever, forever, ever?
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day by day ruler can't be too long
Ms. Jackson my intentions were good I wish I could
become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Askin what happened to the feelin that her and me
Had, I pray so much about it need some knee, pads
It happened for a reason one can't be, mad
So know this, know that everything is cool
And yes I will be present on the first day of school, 
and graduation

CHORUS:
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson [OOOH]
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson [OOOH]
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

[Big Boi]
Uh, uh, yeah
""""Look at the way he treats me"""" 
Shit, look at the way you treat me
You see your little nosy-ass homegirls 
done got your ass sent up the creek G
Without a paddle, you left to straddle 
and ride this thing on out
Now you and your girl ain't speakin no more 
cause my dick all in her mouth
You know what I'm talking about Jealousy, infidelity, envy
Cheating to beating, and D to the G they be the same thing
So who you placin the blame on, you keep on singin the same song
Let bygones be bygones, you can go on and get the hell on
You and your mama

CHORUS:
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson [OOOH]
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson [OOOH]
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson [OOOH]
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson [OOOH]
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry

 i forgot 

I forgot to tell you many things in my other, long, discussion subject, here is one of them (because you say directly and indirectly that you have no interest in the historical truth, but in favouring the roman empire because you are a fan of it, as you explain here on your page):

Besides, never ever no way no how in the whole history of the roman empire, the romans (esspecially in the catastrofal financial situation in Rome, when the empire was on the virge of colaps because of it's lack of money!) never waged costly and long battles against other nations in order to force those nations to accept huge gold tribute from Rome, so those nations can """"built and strenghten their fortresses for future attacks"""", like you, history falsifiers, argumented the roman tribute payed to the Dacians in 88 AD as well as in 102 AD, when the common sense men asked you """"how come those wars were won by romans if at the end of them the romand had to pay anual tribute to the dacians?"""".

And you started to buulshit that that money was """"for building and strenghten the fortresses/defences"""", going so far in your bullshit that for the following war (AD 105) you, as roman empire fan and as such automatically history falsifier), as reason for this roman attack/war on Dacia, you mentioned again the invading romans as """"the good guys""""😉, and the dacians as """"the bad, cut trouths, robbers, dacians""""😉, which were """"justfull punished by the romans"""" in this """"punitive"""" war against the dacians IN DACIA, because """"the dacians used the money received from the romans after the last war and used ut for.. building and strenghten the fortresses/defences""""(!), so for exactly what they were suppose to use it, according to your own afirmations!! Duuh! 

So the roman empire did not invade other countries to demand """"protection money"""" (tribute) from them to not invade them again(tipical italian culture/maffia), but they invaded the world TO PAY anual tribute to those countries??

I do not know what medication do you use, but you obviously forgot to take it for a long time.

Well, you are a roman or a roman fan, so it's understanable that you have no clue what so ever what are you talking about. You are focussing on 1 thing only: Praising the cut throuts romans and presenting them as """"the best and most civilised people in the World"""", which invaded, masacred, robbed and enslaved countless nations and civilisations, because... """"they were the good guys, period""""😉.

Also enjoying throwing women and children (plus everybody actually) alive to wilde beasts to eat them alive in the arena (Damnatio Ad Bestias), was another obvious sign of the """"roman civilisation""""😉 which you admire so much, and which thus also says much about you, who and what you are.

 Allende & Friends  Some Quotations 

Upon Stalin’s death in 1953, Chilean Communists held a “Homage to Stalin” in Santiago’s Baquedano theater. Salvador Allende declared that “Stalin was a banner of creativity, of humanism and an edifying picture of peace and heroism!....Everything he did, he did in service of the people. Our father Stalin has died but in remembering his example our affection for him will cause our arms to grow strong towards building a grand tomorrow — to insure a future in memory of his grand example!”

In January 1971 his minister Carlos Altamirano boasted that: """"We’re following the example of the Cuban Revolution and counting on the support of her militant internationalism ... represented by Fidel Castro and Che Guevara. Armed conflict in continental terms remains as relevant today as ever...Hear me loud and clear!...We will employ revolutionary violence!”

“In the final analysis only armed conflict will decide who is the victor!” asserted his governmental ally, Oscar Guillermo Garreton “Without the complete destruction of the bourgeois character of the state we cannot march on the path of socialism! The class struggle always entails armed conflict. Understand me, the global strategy is always accomplished through arms!”

His deputy economic minister, Sergio Ramos noted mid-1973 “It's evident that the transition to socialism will first require a dictatorship of the proletariat""""

""""We have no choice,” asserted Chilean Communist Volodia Teitelboim, “but to act with resolution and a civil war is not a careful affair. It draws targets on both the political and the apolitical”.

Luis Corvolan declared “We have never considered the path of the Chilean Revolution to be exclusively an electoral one.”

 Clarification needed - Run in with Tom Pettigrew after shooting her brother 

According to the Wiki article, under """"Brother's shooting"""": """"...later pointing the weapon at a moving vehicle on the adjacent road, trying to get into the vehicle....""""

Does the above have anything to do with this?  It doesn't seem so to me.  Here's a snippet of the article:

Carrying a shotgun by her side, a 21-year-old Bishop walked intently across a car lot into the adjacent storefront, where she began searching for car keys. Coming down from the second floor, she was heading toward the garage when she ran into Tom Pettigrew and a friend, who had spotted her in the parking lot and came to investigate.  """"Her gun hit me in the chest,"""" Pettigrew, 45, recalled from his Quincy apartment. """"I yelled, 'What are you doing?' and she screamed at me to put my hands up. So I put my hands up.""""

But the Braintree police chief has cast doubt on that conclusion [that she accidentally killed her brother], and the armed confrontation at the garage provides new insight into her state of mind after her brother's death. The Boston Herald first reported Pettigrew's account of the events today.  Only minutes after that shooting, according to Pettigrew, Bishop frantically told workers at the garage she had been in an argument with her husband and needed a car to escape, nervously scanning the premises as she kept the gun pointed at their backs.

So, my question is did this Pettigrew incident happen before or after she pointed the weapon at a moving vehicle?  In other words, what's the time line?  Thanks.    """,0.0

"""Balance==

I find the balance of content in this article extremely unsatisfactory.  To introduce Badoglio's career by saying he """"was an Italian soldier, politician and alleged war criminal for the use of poison gas and systematically bombarding and strafing Red Cross hospitals and ambulances during the Ethiopia campaign. Due to post-war expediencies, however, he was never brought to justice"""" seems to miss several points entirely.  That's 5 words about his military and political career, and 36 about his activities as a war criminal.  The war criminal accusation is based entirely on one documentary source which is very short on facts and evidence.  If this war criminal accusation is true, it needs to be strengthened with names, dates and places, and some evidence of Badoglio's involvement in the events.  

It seems to me far more important to stress the facts that Badoglio was one of Italy's most senior military figures during the Second World War, despite his doubts about Italy's strategic capabilities, and that he became Prime Minister after the downfall of Mussolini.  Badoglio's role in the inexplicable two months delay between July and September 1943, when Italy's future role in the war remained ambivalent while Germany rushed troops south to fortify the Italian peninsula, is the most fascinating thing about his career.  Whatever the reasons for his failure to act decisively, Badoglio's inaction condemned Italy to suffer another twenty months of grinding war.  This article in its present form barely mentions those events.

Penis envy
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump to: navigation, search
For the Crass album, see Penis Envy (album). For the Virgin 1 documentary, see ....Envy.

Penis envy in Freudian psychoanalysis refers to the theorized reaction of a girl during her psychosexual development to the realization that she does not have a penis. Freud considered this realization a defining moment in the development of gender and sexual identity for women. According to Freud, the parallel reaction in boys to the realization that girls do not have a penis is castration anxiety.

In contemporary culture, the term is sometimes used symbolically or metaphorically to refer to the idea that women wish they had a penis, or to refer to anxieties between men about the size of their genitals.

[edit] Freud's Theory

Sigmund Freud introduced the concept of a little girl's interest in—and envy of— the penis in his 1908 article """"On the Sexual Theories of Children,"""" but did not fully develop the idea until substantially later in 1914 when his work On Narcissism was published. It was not mentioned in the first edition of Freud's earlier Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex (1905).

The term came to significance as Freud gradually refined his views of female sexuality, coming to describe a mental process he believed occurred in girls as they passed through the Electra complex from the phallic stage to the latency stage (see Psychosexual development).

In Freud’s psychosexual development theory, the phallic stage (approximately between the ages of 3.5 and 6) is the first period of development in which the libidinal focus is primarily on the genital area. Prior to this stage, the libido (broadly defined by Freud as the primary motivating energy force within the mind) focuses on other physiological areas. For instance, in the oral stage, in the first 12 to 18 months of life, libidinal needs concentrate on the desire to eat, sleep, suck and bite. The theory suggests that the penis becomes the organ of principal interest to both sexes in the phallic stage. This becomes the catalyst for a series of pivotal events in psychosexual development. These events—known as the Oedipus complex for boys and the Electra complex for girls—result in significantly different outcomes for each gender because of differences in anatomy.

For girls:

    * Soon after the libidinal shift to the penis, the child develops her first sexual impulses towards her mother.
    * The girl realizes that she is not physically equipped to have a heterosexual relationship with her mother, since she does not have a penis.
    * She desires a penis, and the power that it represents. This is described as penis envy. She sees the solution as obtaining her father’s penis.
    * She develops a sexual desire for her father.
    * The girl blames her mother for her apparent castration (what she sees as punishment by the mother for being attracted to the father) assisting a shift in the focus of her sexual impulses from her mother to her father.
    * Sexual desire for her father leads to the desire to replace and eliminate her mother.
    * The girl identifies with her mother so that she might learn to mimic her, and thus replace her.
    * The child anticipates that both aforementioned desires will incur punishment (by the principle of lex talionis)
    * The girl employs the defence mechanism of displacement to shift the object of her sexual desires from her father to men in general.

The offshoot of these events, often cited in the media and colloquially, is that a girl really wants to become her mother, so that she can control her father.

A similar process occurs in boys of the same age as they pass through the phallic stage of development. The key differences being that the focus of sexual impulses need not switch from mother to father, and that the fear of castration (castration anxiety) remains. The boy desires his mother, and identifies with his father, whom he sees as having the object of his sexual impulses. Furthermore, the boy’s father, being the powerful aggressor of the family unit, is sufficiently menacing that the boy employs the defense mechanism of displacement to shift the object of his sexual desires from his mother to women in general.

Freud thought this series of events occurred prior to the development of a wider sense of sexual identity, and was required for an individual to continue to enter into his or her gen",0.14285714285714285

"(The following is not a formal request to be unblocked)

Thank you AnthonyBradbury your comments made sense. The issues I raised relate to the ANI thread still remaining open. Both Erpert,  NEEnt, and now you as an administrator have said that the matter is 'closed.' 

Despite me being blocked 5 days ago and despite Erpert closing the thread and stating no further comments, another editor whatamidoing, removed that and continued making false, baseless claims, quoting inaccurate details, that easily be proved. Further, entirely separate matters, to what my block was for, are now being discussed 'after' I was blocked. Without me having an opportunity to present clear contrary evidence based purely on the objective editing history. And have a fair minded neutral and independent administrator to judge both sides. 

These editors knew there was a ANI thread, but did not comment for 2 days until I was blocked. After I was blocked they then and only then, stuck the boot in, without any facts to back up their false claims. They may have waited until I was blocked because these baselss claims would have been proven false immediately, through me providing diffs and objective facts to the contrary. In fact, they only ceased when I asked for a temporary unblock above to respond! They would have kept 'hammering away' with baseless false claims, providing no facts to back them up and all the while, me being unable to provide the facts. 

I have made some very solid edits to numerous articles. I respect Wikipedia. I respect Wikipedia's policies. I accept the reasons for my current block and would appreciate, after such a significant period, ie. 2 full weeks, to start afresh and be provided an assumption of good faith in my editing rather than editors judging me already. I think all editors, after being blocked should be given the benefit of the doubt. Not to have this thrown in their face for ever more. That's not right. 

I know a lot about some topics. Very little about other topics. My reliable sources have good. My editing and additions have been good. Productive in many different articles. I completely reject being 'incompetent' as whatamidoing states, without me being able to respond. Simply because of differing points of view. I understand whatamidoing and Bilby are very experienced editors who have made great contributions to Wikipedia as editors. No-one is disputing that. They obviously gain a great deal of enjoyment from the project too! Does that provide these editors 'unequal' rights over less experienced editors who are also adding value to the project? Where they can make false baseless assumptions? I realise I have had some previous conflict with the same small group of editors in the past. But that says nothing about my edits being productive and of benefit to the project. 

I believe strongly in the principles of assuming good faith amongst editors. I did not think blocks were punitive whereby other editors can 'mock' the person who has been blocked? Nor are blocks an opportunity to make false, entirely baseless assumptions about an editor's competence. Is the ANI thread closed or is it not closed please AnthonyBradbury? I am hesitant to ask this through a formal request unblocking request. So could an administrator tell me if this ANI thread that was abruptly re-opened by whatamidoing, after the block was already applied, and the thread closed?",0.0

This band has emo lyrics, that should be stated somewhere in the article, I would add it myself but I'm probably going to get RV by some sensitive fan.

Punk Revival
Emo

 Former Band Members Section? 

Do any of you think that someone should add a section specifically for """"Former Members"""" and then talk about the controversy involving whether the bass lines in the album were actually his or not? I don't like the fact that it's just bunched in with the current members with no explaination on the dismissal. 

 Wikiproject proposal 

I've proposed a Panic! at the Disco Wikiproject here, to see how many people would be interested before starting one. The project would be an effort by a group of Wikipedians to build and improve all Panic! at the Disco pages (including members of the band, songs and albums). If you think that you'd be reguarly editing these pages, please put your name down at this page so we can see who would be interested in the project. Thanks in advance- '  talk |  

many people believe that the band members may be homosexuals but as they said in one of there interviews on absoluterock they said they confirmed """"none of the band members are gay not that theres anything wrong with it""""-ryan ross

""""emo""""

Wouldn't things just be alot easier if people could all just agree on Panic! being emo? """"Emo"""" is basically this generation's """"grunge"""". Sure, the bands may not sound very similar to each other at all, but did Nirvana sound similar to Pearl Jam? No, not really. So just because Panic! and say, My Chemical Romance might not sound exactly similar that doesn't mean they can't be the same genre. And guess what- just because """"emo"""" bands hate being called that doesn't mean anything. """"Grunge"""" bands hated being called grunge too. 

And there definetly IS an emo sound. There's definetly a particular vocal style, lyrical style, and attitude that emo bands have.

Agreed, Panic! is an emo band, but many fans here seem to have a problem with that. 

A lot of people get really sensitive about things they like being labelled emo, I think it's just because the stereotypical emo isn't really something that a lot of people want to be associated with. I agree that the vocal style especially is emo, and the way they look is also associated with emo- not all songs, but some songs of theirs have 'emo-ish' lyrics, too. I'm fine with the genre being changed, it's just a matter of fans researching them here and becoming offended- instead of discussing it here, it's going to be changed back a lot. However, on the page it's set as emo and alternative rock, which is perfect. '  talk |  

 Early 2007 album 

It says their new album will be ready for compalation in early 2007, that's not true in Rolling Stone Ryan says He plans to write/ record the album during the summer of 2007 and release it during the fall of 2007. I would add it but i've never done anything like that before so I figured i'd just put it in here. http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/panic_at_the_disco_high_school_musical?source=panicatthedisco_rssfeed That's the link to the rolling stone thing by the way.

Not everyone believes this crap, copied from AN/I
I do not know either John254 or Kristin Erikson and recently stumbled across this. But, I have to say this looks like a witch hunt with evidence that wouldn't even hold up as circumstantial. They can't prove they're not socks, so they must be. And any evidence to the contrary is more proof because it must have been deliberately planted. If we ban then and they drown, then they must have been innocent after all. Personally, I've been editing Wikipedia since the beginning (late 2001), both as an IP user and with an account that I have abandoned, so I fully understand KE appearing on Wikipedia knowing more than you think a new user """"""""should"""". I would bet that the vast majority (like 99%) of users spend some time editing as an IP user before they create an account  the only question is how long they spend that way. It looks like KE didn't bother creating an account until she found a need to do so. That not only is not wrong, it should be encouraged.
Like KE, I have also edited extensively as an IP. For the most part, I found no reason to create an account, but I created a new account recently with my real name and, of course, my new account appeared to be an expert about Wikipedia immediately. Like KE, I also dive deeply into things. Were you to accuse me of being John254's sock puppet, I would do the same that she did  dig into his edit history and compare it to mine to look for evidence to prove my innocence. Most of the contributors here have dug into KE's edit history and now may well know more about it than she does  are you therefore sock puppets too?
Suggesting that defending herself with evidence, against people who are accusing her with flimsy evidence, is ridiculous. And, to argue that she would have deliberately created arguments with herself and other contrary evidence, over a long period of time, just in case anybody ever complained is hard to believe.
At best, the evidence here looks like collusion, not sock puppetry, and I don't even see that. But, even so, there is no rule against collusion on Wikipedia. And we see it all the time, with people cooperating on edits. I personally have emailed people I know to suggest that they edit pages in which I had an interest. Doing so does not make them my sock puppet or vice versa, whether they agree with me or disagree with me. 
To me, this flimsy house of cards rush to judgment and assumption of guilt represents the very worst of Wikipedia, and I think that even if it turns out that they are witches (uh, sock puppets). And I, personally, do not believe it to be true after reading this and the information on KE's page.

Espionage or a dick spying on some pussy lovers involves an individual obtaining information that is considered secret or confidential without the permission of the holder of the information. Espionage is inherently clandestine, as the legitimate holder of the information may change plans or take other countermeasures once it is known that the information is in unauthorized hands. See clandestine HUMINT for the basic concepts of such information collection, and subordinate articles such as clandestine HUMINT operational techniques and clandestine HUMINT asset recruiting for discussions of the """"tradecraft"""" used to collect this information.
Hey I gotta joke and it goes like this:Dick says """"Hey Balls get ready for a patry"""" Balls replies """"You fucking liar. Everytime we go to a party, you always go in and leave us out here knockin.  

History
Incidents of espionage are well documented throughout history. The ancient writings of Chinese and Indian military strategists such as Sun-Tzu and Chanakya contain information on deception and subversion. Chanakya's student Chandragupta Maurya, founder of the Maurya Empire, made use of assassinations, spies and secret agents, which are described in Chanakya's Arthasastra. The ancient Egyptians had a thoroughly developed system for the acquisition of intelligence, and the Hebrews used spies as well, as in the story of Rahab. Feudal Japan often used ninja to gather intelligence. More recently, spies played a significant part in Elizabethan England (see Francis Walsingham). Many modern espionage methods were well established even then. http://www.henrywotton.org.uk/

The Cold War involved intense espionage activity between the United States of America and its allies and the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China and their allies, particularly related to nuclear weapons secrets. Recently, espionage agencies have targeted the illegal drug trade and those considered to be terrorists.

Different intelligence services value certain  intelligence collection techniques over others. The former Soviet Union, for example, preferred  human sources over  research in open sources, while the United States has tended to emphasize technological methods such as SIGINT and IMINT. Both Soviet political (KGB) and military intelligence (GRU
 ) officers were judged by the number of agents they recruited. 

Various Forms
Unlike other forms of  intelligence collection disciplines, espionage usually involves accessing the place where the desired information is stored, or accessing the people who know the information and will divulge it through some kind of subterfuge. There are exceptions to physical meetings, such as the Oslo Report, or the insistence of Robert Hanssen in never meeting the people to whom he was selling information.

The US defines espionage towards itself as """"The act of obtaining, delivering, transmitting, communicating, or receiving information about the national defense with an intent, or reason to believe, that the information may be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation. Espionage is a violation of 18 United States Code 792-798 and Article 106, Uniform Code of Military Justice{{cite web

Appreciate the question, however I am not qualified to answer it. I live in Michigan, but do spend the winters in the Myrtle Beach area. I have been doing this (off and on ) for over 20 years. I often go to Atalaya Castle and Brookgreen Gardens - but basically for the enjoyment and taking pictures. I know little of the history of these places, other than what is in the brochures given out by the state. All the pictures at Brookgreen Gardens is mine - including at the bottom a slide show presentation of additional pictures. All the pictures at Commons are also mine. All the pictures at Atalaya Castle are also mine, except for the B & W one. Also recently I added a slide show presentation at the bottom of the group of pictures of additional pictures I took in 2006. Do these slide show presentations work for you? I have checked them on various computers at various locations and they appear to work properly (especially of the high speed connections). Sorry I couldn't help more. I think probably your best bet is others that edit these articles, especially the ones that started them (if they are still around). There is an article on Huntington Beach State Park which I have edited, however basically from a formating """"clean up"""" standpoint (removing peacock terms). Notice they are requesting additional photos of HBSP, so will have to go take some and enter into the article. Maybe even make a slide show. What do you think of this idea of a """"slide show"""" of pictures? Should they be narrated or is classical music alright? How about amateur home movies of places like this? BTY, Atalya Castle is directly across Highway 17 from Brookgreen Gardens. Brookgreen Gardens is about a mile directly inland. In the slide show of Atalaya the first slide shows the original road going directly from the residence of Atalaya Castle to Brookgreen Gardens as the Huntingtons would have used it in the 1930's to move the large sculptures. Since, Highway 17 was built and has cut it in half. All this property was then owned by the Huntingtons.  talk """,0.0

I have not yet seen Tim's paper, I assume that it demonstrates that lithium is not an *essential* nutrient by its absence. That doesn't kick it out of OMM. The claim seems that lithium and orotate ions are naturally occurring, utilizable substances in the diet and orthomolecular substances packaged in a salt, similar to common synthetic vitamins, e.g. thiamine nitrate, vs the natural cocarboxylase (pyrophosphate). OMM is not so synthetic friendly to the alien enantiomers in synthetic oil solubles.  However Lithium is most certainly a naturally occuring item in the water of many places; growing up in one place whose water source contained Li this was something of a joke about why people were so mellow. This will come up about others like strontium which are reputed to be good for the bones too, the natural versions considered OMM. Then there is strontium ranelate, a xenobiotic because of the artificial anion.  OMM's relation to pharmacological herbs seems ambivalent for several reasons.  One, probably, is that the largest body adopting the most (adapting from) OMM are probably the naturopaths, so if it is in the approved garden, why sweat it?  Honestly though, there is the question, how do we define xenobiotic and not xenobiotic in OMM? I don't have a fast answer myself between applying Pauling's definition and the definite feeling that some plant extracts are not OMM but xenobiotics.  One can probably develop a Socratic argument starting with hemlock... As for the St John's Wort, the plant contains things that are definitely nutrients. The extract is a homework assignment. This is one of the gray areas where *my impression* is that one may traverse from the orthomolecular field to the herbal part of naturopathy without necessarily encountering a clear boundary. (Sort of like the pressurized, critical path skirting, water heating experiment with no clear phase change between liquid and steam and back) One other comment is that it is """"okay"""" if something is not OMM, OMM does not claim to be the """"be all, end all"""" answer, or a jealous god, er, guild. OMM MDs do apply conventional drugs and surgery more sparingly, they probably just don't get as many """"free"""" boat trips (but the Glacier cruise is nice).  """,0.0

"Hi Osmond, Please understand, I really like your images. I'd love to have all of them added to articles. I think the collection itself is notable and may merit an WP article itself. But WP is a sometimes difficult place to get started contributing because they have so many different guidelines and different editors interpret them different ways. WP requires that when images are contributed the contributor has to be able to demonstrate that they fit the open source or Creative Commons licensing policy. 

 Because you are the uploader of the images, your simple declaration of their provenance, that the images are all pre-1923 and are of the people you say they are, may not be sufficient to meet WP guidelines. I truly believe that many of them in fact are of the individuals stated. The likenesses are very clear, though in a few instances, less so. I'd really like to help you get the images accepted as valid. They are a wonderful contribution to the historic lore about the individuals who they are supposed to be pictures of.

 I'm sorry, I'm not near Kearny, Missouri this week, or I'd love to see the collection. Is that where you're from?

 I'm not the final arbiter of all of this. I suggest we get some input from other editors on how to validate that the images are genuine and their provenance is proven. To start, this will probably require you to provide some third-party sources to establish that the images were taken before 1923, or proof that the studio on the image closed before 1923, or other evidence. Then you will have to provide some third-party opinion that the images are of the individuals taken. Or you'll have to make available other evidence that the person's names were written on the images. The articles you named may be helpful if you can provide source info, links, or publication info. 

 I'm totally on your side. I'd like to find a way to establish the authenticity of the images. But you also have to understand that as the owner of the images, if you can clearly establish the authenticity of the images, you could be greatly rewarded financially. So you're not a disinterested person when it comes to proving the that pictures are of the people you say they are. Because this is a complex issue, due diligence is required.

 Give me a day or two to explore the proper way to get other editors input into this discussion. There's a formal process for this kind of thing and I'm not sure what it is. —  (talk to me) (what I've done)",0.0

So that's a start to  you seemingly acknowledging your belief that there is some valid evidence for the material you dispute.  

The text doesn't state that """"men [don't know] how to."""" It states something that Kinsey concluded, and it is clearly attributed to Kinsey  """"Kinsey attributed this difference to female partners knowing more about women's sexuality and how to optimize women's sexual satisfaction than male partners do."""" We are allowed to mention researchers' conclusions, and this conclusion by Kinsey is especially relevant to the text. It's also what I just stated above: """"Obviously, women generally know what makes other women feel good sexually, which is what the researchers are saying."""" It is your opinion and a case-by-case basis that """"having orgasms most of the time during sex does not equal sexual satisfaction in a relationship."""" I state that because it's not the same case for everyone. It is also your opinion that lesbians experience less sexual satisfaction in a relationship. The sources you kept removing state the very opposite of what you assert about sexual satisfication in lesbian relationships. And because they do, you've asserted that they are biased and/or unreliable. They are not. Those sources are what most of the research states about sexual satisfaction in lesbian relationships. Most of the sources do not state what Schwartz stated about sexual satisfaction in lesbian relationships. Not even half of reliable sources state that. Her view is a minority view, and it's also an outdated view because of what I've noted already. It hasn't been replicated. New research on lesbian sexuality consistently reports the opposite of Schwartz's assertion about sexual satisfaction in lesbian relationships. And I reiterate that Schwartz was focusing on long-term lesbian relationships, not just on lesbian relationships in general.   

The article is not a comparison article. It mentions a few comparisons to heterosexual sex in the Research section because these comparisons are notable and especially relevant to the topic. This is because researchers have often studied that aspect of lesbian sexuality, to help them better understand it as compared to heterosexual sexual activity. They obviously didn't see that it was needed or especially relevant to compare lesbian sexual satisfaction to gay male sexual satisfaction. And since gay male couples don't include women, I can see why they felt that way. They were comparing how women are sexually satisfied by a different sex/gender. They brought heterosexual couples into it. It wasn't Wikipedia that did that. And we should report on it because they did and made it a big part of studies on lesbian sexuality. Simply listing stats doesn't sufficiently inform readers of this information, unless those stats are as detailed as the text. And you really need to stop citing that discredited Schwartz study as though it is a majority or widely held view among researchers. It isn't. But I agree that it should be included in the article. 

We don't have to list stats for the lines you quoted above. What we have to do is follow the sources. If the sources had stats, then maybe we would include those. But including them also doesn't mean that they would be traded out for the text material. The """"Other elements of lesbian sexual encounters include more full-body sexual contact"""" line is about lesbians only, and it's supported by two reliable sources. I understand that you take objection with that paragraph because it's stating that women in same-sex sexual relationships are more satisfied, sexually and in life in general, but it's what the sources say. Still, it would probably be better to attribute that to the author(s) reporting it. We don't have to present a survey that asked heterosexual women and lesbian women their sexual satisfaction levels. That is covered by the sources, and only material especially relevant to the topic of lesbian sexual practices should be included. And, yeah, you have made claims. And, no, you don't present sources. Not generally. For sources, all you've done is repeatedly note the Schwartz study, no matter how many times I point out to you that it is discredited, and you state that """"many other sources"""" show the opposite of the material you kept removing. If there were many other sources of such nature, you'd be able to present one other than the Schwartz study, which is not an opposing study (as in a study directly going against what the studies in the article have found).

 Definition of witchcraft/Wicca 

I have some problems with this section. It's all very nice to be able to laugh and say """"you're wrong on all these points"""", but in fact this section is misrepresenting Wicca just as much as the Harry-haters.
The heading itself seems to imply that witchcraft and Wicca are synonymous. Wicca is merely one variety of modern witchcraft.
Wiccans commune with the dead and the spirit world. At Halloween (or Samhain), for example, we invite the spirits of our ancestors and deceased loved ones to return and share our warmth and companionship for an evening. Extensive spirit contact by Wiccans (via ouija board and channeling) is recounted in A Voice in the Forest by Jimahl diFiosa, an Alexandrian High Priest.
Sorcery: well, Wiccans definitely perform magic. The word 'sorcery' has a sinister sound to it, which perhaps doesn't fit with Wicca so well, but if it merely means 'performing magic', then certainly.
Occult symbology: this is merely a catch-all phrase for anything that looks a bit 'occult', isn't it? Well, Wicca is very definitely 'occultism', since it deals with magic and the hidden parts of reality. And yes, Wiccans use occult symbols, such as zodiacal signs.
Curses are of course forbidden in Wicca, as is all malicious or harmful magic.
Demon posession: Whoever accused Wiccans of practicing demon posession is pulling a swift one. Wiccans practice what could loosely be called """"posession"""": calling our God or Goddess into the body of a priest or priestess. I guess this is fairly similar to what Christians call """"being filled with the spirit"""", but if you happen to consider the Wiccan gods to be demons (and of course they're demons, aren't they, since any deity other than Jehovah is a demon), then you could term this """"demon possession"""", feeling only a tinge of guilt at your verbal chicanery.

The real reason why Harry Potter has nothing to do with Wicca is because Harry Potter is fantasy, presented in a manner that has virtually no resemblance to the reality of modern witchcraft, whether it be Wicca or any other variety. How many kids watch the Power Rangers and decide they want to enter law enforcement as a ranger when they grow up? The Texas Rangers, just like the Power Rangers, wear uniforms, fight bad guys, protect law and order, have headquarters and so on. The parallels are all there, but any rational person will immediately discern the vast differences.

I don't think we need to misrepresent our religion, simply because some people get the flutters whenever the words 'magic' or 'occult' are mentioned. Lets show a bit of backbone, rather than trying to turn our faith into what we think Christians want it to be! ★ """,0.0

 No association between """"Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory"""" and """"Bell Labs""""? 

Earlier on this page,  had enquired:

Name origin
Wasn't the parent company (and hence weren't the labs) named after Alexander Graham Bell?  No mention of him can I find here. Carrionluggage 

Today User:BilCat deleted a recent section addition to the article titled """"Early namesake"""" in its entirety, which chronicled the """"Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory"""", also known as the Volta Laboratory (which A.G. Bell created after he won the Volta Prize). The deleted section was titled 'Early namesake' for the reason that there was an association by name as follows:
 1876 –A.G. Bell receives master phone patent, becomes part owner of the Bell Telephone Company, later renamed American Bell Telephone Company;
 1880 –A.G. Bell creates the Volta Laboratory, a.k.a. the Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory, for research into sound recording and transmission, including the photophone; also
 1880 –""""the management of American Bell created what would become AT&T; Long Lines."""" A.G. Bell still owns shares in ABTC, and hence thus is part owner of AT&T;  he remains """"Chief Electrician"""" of ABTC and its children for several years;
 1881 –Western Union withdrew from the telephone market and allowed Bell Telephone to acquire its telephone manufacturing arm Western Electric;
 1885  –The long lines project """"was formally incorporated into a separate company named American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T;)"""";
 1899  –""""the American Telephone and Telegraph Company bought the assets of American Bell""""  (that would appear to be a friendly takeover of the parent corporation by the child);
 1925 –Bell Labs is created, and assumes the research roles conducted by Western Electric Research Laboratories and part of AT&T;'s engineering department.

Whether any research projects were passed from the Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory to the Western Electric Research Laboratories or AT&T; Engineering, and then onto the newly created Bell Labs is moot, since the section was entitled Early namesake and never inferred that there was such a connection. That there was a connection by name and share ownership, as shown above, is obvious; therefore the deleted section has now been reinstated as pertinent to the Bell Labs article.  Comments?    """,0.0

Not being used to Wiki process I didn't see the warning until after it was made although I'm not sure what that difference would have made long term. The notion of fascism in respect of the operation of wiki is not meant as an insult but describes a particular way of operating a nation, organisation etc. Having spent many years dealing with institutional abuse of authority etc. the """"harassment"""" of my contribution was corporate, but for those very reasons it will not be a productive line of enquiry. I suppose I could also turn to a zealous enforcement of the rules and seek wiki awards. 
Anyway in respect of my request we're now leaving wiki territory in terms of copyright and going where statutory law applies. Can you point me in the direction of an administrator or agent of wiki that can deal with this issue knowledgeabley? I haven't assigned copyright to wiki and wiki policy can't supersede law. I suppose I could formally assign copyright of all those images to a third party which would immediately create a wiki violation.
I'd also be interested in views about the difference between self-interest in requiring attribution and that notion in respect of links. It's a mark (and again this is a valid view) of paternalistic and authoritarian operations no matter how benign to operate arbitrarily without explanation.

He was stripped under bogus politics. Your sources are still SHIT. You haven't heard of any of the sources I posted because you're a noob whos only knowledge is from hbo & The Ring, who have ZERO credibility on this issue.

Jones had only won a """"vacant interim"""" wbc belt, champion Tiozzo relinquished the wbc belt, Jones was declared wbc holder then relinquished it. Rocchigiani won it then Jones decides he wants it back so the wbc illegally stripped Rocchigiani. Michalczewski then defeated the rightful holder.

Re-read the fucking link;

http://www.boxrec.com/media/index.php?title=Fight:12432

My main source is the Linear championship policy which goes back over 100 years. A policy you, being so dumb, don't even understand. HBO are a joke....whenever Jones faced his hand picked opponents defending his bogus belts on their broadcasts, hbo would even mention the legit champion - Michalczewski.""",0.14285714285714285

 Super Bowl Loss 

The recent Super Bowl loss is a highly significant event in the history of the Patriots franchise. The opening section discusses the """"dynasty"""" status of the Patriots, but hardly mentions the effect of the recent loss. This page has featured status for fair and proper discussion of important Patriots facts. However, the page now feels unbalanced and biased due to its brief and perfunctory coverage of this highly significant loss. It is beginning to feel like a protected fan page, as opposed to a balanced and factual discussion of important facts relating to the Patriots. Obviously the page should be protected from vandalism by Giants fans, but this page needs to acknowledge that the Patriots lost a game that many football experts are calling one of the greatest upsets of all time.  137.159.153.35  DLOMME 02/06/08
Yup.  communicator/kills 

 Taunting Disguised as Factual Information 

Looking through the history of edits since the Super Bowl, a lot of information that's being added (and much of it since deleted) may be true, but the inclusion of it into the article seems more like a subtle attempt at taunting.  Is it really relevant that the Patriots are the first 18-1 team NOT to win the Super Bowl?    Who cares?  And believe me, I'm no Patriots fan (they've been a thorn in my team's side since last season's playoffs), but this is supposed to be an encyclopedia entry, not a fan forum.  This page should be locked from any further edits for awhile, unless something TRULY relevant to the Patriots should suddenly occur.   
Actually, protection is not something to be taken lightly.  Being an admin (and even though I am a die-hard Pats fan myself), the level of problematic edits to this article, while high, is not so bad that we haven't been able to keep up with it by rollbacks and undos.  .talk.contribs 

FAR
I've nominated the article for Featured Article review since a lot of the content that was there when it was nominated has now been moved elsewhere.   

 Protection  

This article is starting to get vandilized again. If it were up to me I would make it temporarly semiprotected. I wonder why vandilism is returning to it. Get over it people, the superbowl's over!!!  
So you want me to request semi-protection?  communicator/kills'' 

 Bias?? 

The Franchise history section seems to be a little biased against the Patriots.  Whenever a Superbowl loss is mentioned, the opposing team and score are given.  When it gets to the part about the Patriots winning Superbowls not only are the teams/scores not given, but it doesn't even say that they won them.  ie: """"Under Belichick, the team went to''' three Super Bowls in four years...""""  It should be consistant one way or the other.

The sentence, """"The Patriots, however, were defeated by the New York Giants in Super Bowl XLII, after winning the first 18 games of their 2007 season.""""  is very clumsily tacked on to the first section.  I think it warrants another sentence or 2 or at least the deletion of the word """"howev",0.0

""":: This discussion belongs to years ago, so I hope that my comment will still be helpful. First of all, a necessary preamble: consonants in Italian can be double or single, as is well known; however, what is often overlooked in this description is that this contrast can only occur in certain positions, i.e. in between vowels or between a vowel and a """"semivowel"""" (/w/ and /j/) or, for plosives, between a vowel and """"r""""/""""l""""; in all other position all consonants have an indeterminate length. So in the word """"pasto"""" (""""meal"""") neither the """"s"""" nor the """"t"""" can be described as being """"single"""" or """"double"""", they have an intermidiate, indeterminate length (pronouncing something like """"passto"""" or """"pastto"""" would be meaningless in Italian phonology, unlike other languages featuring geminate consonants like Finnish). So, applying this concept to the pronunciation of """"r"""": single """"r"""" is pronounced as a flap, double and indeterminate """"r"""" are pronounced as a trill in standard pronounciation; for example """"caro"""" (dear) contains a flap, while """"terra"""" (earth) and """"treno"""" (train) both contain a trill. You can check this listening to the entries of the """"Dizionario di Ortografia e Pronuncia"""", published by the Italian state television RAI and which is (or used to be) available on this page. Using the trill in """"caro"""", no matter how short, would inevitably turn it into """"carro"""" (charriot). 
I am a native speaker, I've taught Italian to foreigners and I have studied and compared Italian phonology in depth. Of course, this claims are not sufficient for wikipedia, but there's an inherent problem when referencing publications on the subject. For long time phonology has been considered in Italy just a lesser part of grammar; more importantly, most study focussed on internal controversies and variations, i.e. describing the language from within the language, a more objective and scientific study of the phonetics is quite limited. It suffices to say that even IPA has hardly ever been used in the description of Italian phonetics, many authors using custom phonetic conventions even in promimenent works (such as the one I linked before). This means that while the contrast between /e/ and /ɛ/ or /ɔ/ and /o/ is widely discussed in many pubblication because there's a lot of variation in distribution, little work can be found about other distinctive traits of Italian phonology that are uniform or nearly so among native speakers (e.g. the assimilation of place of articulation of """"n"""" with the following consonant; the lengthening of the vowel in stressed, open syllables inside words; phonetic value of syllables like in /pas.to/ contrasting with the prescribed orthographic split """"pa-sto"""", syllable-timed rythm, etc.). The difference of distribution of flap vs trill for """"r"""", as well as an accurate description of consonants of incontrastive length in general, has been largely disreguarded.

 All this argument crap. 

In my opinion, 
a) Notability is established in this article in the fact that One Bid is a qualifying game played 6 times a show, every show, 5 days a week, on a highly rated network game show, and has been an element of every version of the show since the original. It would be ideal to have some other citations to show it's been recognized outside of the show itself, but I believe sufficient notability has been met, and the tag needn't be there.

b) Original research. If you are read the tag, it says """"See talk page for details."""" If you are not going to either tag with  or start a talk page section explaining what you believe is original research (or be more specific by tagging only the relevant sections), then I don't believe the tag should stand

c) I think this article does need more citations. I think almost every article on wikipedia needs more citations than are currently there. However, since there isn't even a single  tag on the article, I don't see what specific information is felt to be requiring citation. As I understand it, Wikipedia practice allows primary sources (in this case, the show itself) to act as a source for anything relevant to rules and how the game is played and what happens. So if there are major uncorroborated facts in the article, you ought to tag them specifically to justify a refimprove banner tag

d) The merge discussion seems to have been abandonned. I believe it should be appropriately revived and an actual pro/con vote be taken, or else abandon the merge tag. I see no evidence of support from the discussion linked to in the tag.

This is my opinion as to how the tags should be dealt with. It is not sufficient to just say """"original research exists in this article so I'm going to slap a tag at the top."""" (for example). These tags should be supported by specific explainations or pointers to actual problematic content unless the entire article really needs citing or is original research, which I don't find to be the case here.

That's very nice, but have you seen the kind of stuff this guy has done? I tried created a couple of articles about television shows (we have tons of them on Wikipedia) and he deleted them in seconds, before I had a chance to even get them started! He didn't call a vote for deletion, he just abused his powers to delete them outright. He told me not to create stubs. We should be grateful that he wasn't in charge of creating Microsoft Word or we wouldn't be able to save anything until our 10-page term papers were finished and spell-checked!

And you defend this man and his administrative powers? Is he really Wikipedia material?

Your Signature

The following is a passage from Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages

=== Images ===

Images of any kind should not be used in signatures.

Many concerns have been raised over the use of images in signatures, and they are considered to serve no use to the encyclopedia project.  Images in signatures should not be used for several reasons:

 they are an unnecessary drain on server resources, and could cause server slowdown
 a new image can be uploaded in place of the one you chose, making your signature a target for possible vandalism and Denial-of-service attacks
 they reduce searchability, making pages more difficult to read
 they make it more difficult to copy text from a page
 they are potentially distracting from the actual message
 in most browsers images do not scale with the text, making lines with images higher than those without
 they clutter up the """"file links"""" list on the image page every time you sign on a different talk page
 images in signatures give undue prominence to a given user's contribution

I believe you were not aware of this, but please remove the image from your signature. Thank you,  ►  """,0.0

The reason this pro-russian bias on this article keeps reoccuring is because Ymblanter is an admin and possibly other pro-russian admins are allowing this. Also, your lack of understanding of a Neutral Point of View doesn't help either.

Tricky situatian you got yourself into here, shame that I don't have the time or the motivation to meddle is pointless discussions with people who are brainwashed into thinking that they have nothing to do with Crimea by their own government. 

Just open any site that isin't Russia Today, and you'll see the real situation in Crimea and not what Ymblanter or any of your russian buddies are trying to portray here. I've had numerous discussions with pro-russians and I know that you don't have the capabilities to think by yourself, even If you had - Ymblanter would come in and adjust it to give a false impression of russian """"uninvolvement"""" in the matter.

Harrassment, I did not do.  He posted a question or whatever and I replyed, I was never rude, I never cussed, I never said anything rude to him or about him (if you want to count """"are you 5?"""" in that, OK, I admit that one).  

The edit warring...I was removing posts on the KDKA-TV page that did not belong.  Newscasts on WPCW, whether produced by KDKA or not, do not belong on the KDKA page.  I tried telling User:Kd lvr this, he didn't continued to post.  He was putting information that I couldn't confirm.  Such as former KDKA anchor Jennifer Antkowiak is now """"working with Leslie Sansone's In Home Walking Program"""".  I looked this site up and could find no mention of Ms. Antkowiak.  I did a Google search, same thing.  This is inaccurate and unconfirmed (if it is true) information.

The assuming bad faith, I had backed off on when it was found that User:Kdkatpir2 and User:Kd lvr were not one in the same.  I thought they were, I didn't agree with it, but I had to accept that.  When User:Kdkatpir2 was blocked for sockpuppetry, then I knew than that it was as confirmed as it could be that User:Kd lvr was up to no good.  Had User:Kdkatpir2 not been blocked, I would not have done anything and would have gone back to updating pages like I have done.

I make it a point not to be rude to users here (there are other users for that), I make it a point to pass problems off to an admin so I don't get in trouble and cause I don't want to deal with it.  I was reverting posts on the KDKA page cause I thought it was the best thing to do at the time and prior to being blocked, I was actually updatign the KDKA page, so that the back and forth that User:Kd lvr and I were doing (which was annoying the hell outta me) would come to an end (and also make the page easier to read as well).

If I was only here to berate people day in and day out, I would have been blocked long ago.  I have been blocked only once before for a 24 hour 3RR violation, which I admit I did and I took something too far.  That was my fault that time, but I did nothing wrong here.  I was doing what I thought was right, reverting information that was incorrect and inaccurate and attempting to stop a user (who was ultimately found to be a sockpuppet by an admin) before harm was done by his behaviour.

If I seemed like I was being rude or I was breaking a rule, then I apologize.  I am sorry.  I didn't mean for my actions to come off in that light.  If my actions seemed wrong, I apologize.  I didn't mean for them to and I had no and have no ill-will toward User:Kdkatpir2 and User:Kd lvr.  If I have broken a rule, then again, I apologize, that was not my intention.

I, again, ask that my block be lifted as I did not mean for my actions to be taken in the way that they were and I was not trying to break any rules with my actions.  I, again, apologize. -  (VT) """,0.0

 registration number for Boeing 299 is common knowledge.
 RAF Liberator B.I - ran visible s/n through Baugher page, verified though internet search.
 caption for SB-17G 44-83722 comes from my B-17 survivors page - this aircraft until recently was a survivors but has been parted out to get 3 other B-17's flyable - this aircraft was also used as an atom bomb ground test target.
 B-17G 43-38172 information can be found here: info about 43-38172 - tried doing this as a reference but could not get the link correct.

 trying to find the s/n for B-17E Pistol Packin' Momma

some of the information is just a matter of doing a google search - I like detailed captions and have tried to do a little clean-up of the captions - the order I like is Make and model and s/n on the top line (ie B-17G-30BO 43-XXXX), aircraft name right at the beginning of the second line then rest of info afterwards

Well, as they appear in more episodes I was being forced to realize that they are not """"recurring guests"""". Since the companions are seeing fit to include some real world info on them it was either create 4 new sections and develop them in the style of Oliver Queen...or, create a new page for all of them to exist and trim Oliver's section down to something like Clark's section and then create sections for the others that mirror that setup as well. The thing with Martha and Jonathan is that they aren't going to get any bigger.

"""Married to the MOB, also known as MTTM or simply MOB, is a women’s streetwear clothing line started by Leah McSweeney in 2004.  The line is inspired by New York streets and clubs and rocks a chic, but not-to-be-messed with attitude that attracts style-confident females everywhere.

Leah McSweeney

Leah McSweeney (born in 1982 in New York City) is founder and CEO of the successful female Married to the MOB clothing line.  Her early years were spent in New York City until she was thrown out in eighth grade from an all girls catholic school, Convent of the Sacred Heart, whose alumni include Lady Gaga and the Hilton Sisters.  Afterwards, Leah’s family moved to Newtown, Connecticut where she ran away every weekend to get back to her NYC roots.  Once Leah finished high school, she moved back to the Big Apple and went to the Fashion Institute of Technology for one week before calling it quits. 

Tired of seeing guys having the coolest gear and brands, Leah had the brilliant idea of creating her own female clothing line , Married to the MOB, in 2004. Leah used her settlement of $75,000 (from a law suit stemming from a police officer attack) to jumpstart her idea and bought an Apple computer and painted her Spring Street apartment walls pink. 

Leah’s apartment became the Married to the MOB headquarters; everyone from Leah's model sister and MOB poster girl Sarah McSweeney to her teenage friend Tabatha McGurr, daughter of well-known graffiti artist Futura 2000, became part of the crew.  The clothing line grew from there, and Leah switched her headquarters to the Empire State Building.  

McSweeney has been included in a multitude of publications, such as [Elle Girl], [Inked (magazine)], [Complex (magazine)], [Elle (magazine)], [Vogue (magazine)], Hypebeast magazine, Format magazine, [Essence (magazine)], Paper magazine, Urb magazine, Teen Vogue, and Nylon magazine.

MTTM Collaborations and Beyond
 

The bold statements on its graphic tees such as """"Supreme Bitch"""" or """"New York needs Peter Gatien” have become the brand's trademark. Even the tagline “Men are the new women” from a MOB campaign was even used in conjunction with the tv show Big Shots (TV series). Supreme store owner James Jebbia also worked with MOB and carried the brand’s tees in his stores.

MOB's hands bikini with graffiti artist Kaws was a stepping-stone for Leah's company. With the suit's handprints boldly placed on every guy’s favorite spots on a girl’s body, this product is one of the more renowned MOB collabs. Various collabs followed in 2007, notably with the German accessory house MCM and a MOB x Kangol cashmere beanie.
 
Leah's love for France got her to meet graffiti artist Fafi, who helped design and model for the 07 Spring/Summer campaign. French avant-garde boutique Colette (boutique) collaborated successfully with MOB on Reebok lip print sneakers that sold out online in 23 minutes.  MOB teamed up with Nike in November 08 on a white tweed and black patent dunk. The MOB girls dropped a denim line as well as cut and sew for Winter 08. February 09 brought KRINK inks and MOB together, and they co-branded a Valentine's Day pack.  

In Spring 09, the first wave of the collection was a collaboration with Chicago rapper, Kid Sister.  MOB's second wave of Spring 09 had the brand working with artist Jessy Kennedy, aka The Nite Rider, who added her naughty illustrations to a classically controversial MOB shirt.  With the 50th Anniversary of Barbie in March 09, Colette (boutique) continued its relationship with MOB with a commemorative tee. 

 

Seen and Heard

Married to the MOB (clothing) has been seen on many musicians and celebrities alike.  The line has been worn by rapper Uffie,  multi-talented artist Fergie (singer), singer Lady Gaga, model Doutzen Kroes, musician Kid Sister, and rapper Lady Sovereign.

On reflection, I just have a hard time believing this.  I'm sorry.  You mean Walmart really doesn't take into account whether it's a Friday with medium customers vs. a Saturday with a lot of customers ? ?  So, this guy is a department manager.  His job is to lead his or her team and kept the assigned area stocked and put back together after customers tear it up, to be frank about it.  Just as a guess, I think Walmart probably does have more cashiers on a Saturday.  Okay, so a customer is shopping and wants to know where something is.  So, the employee is not thrilled about helping the customer because the employee up to and including the department manager is just going to later get criticized for not getting more work done.

You shouldn't, because it's true that this moment (Homer raped by a Panda) is widely regarded as the worst, most tasteless gag in the whole series. I accept that the bit in parenthesis shouldn't be there, it's pure POV and not encyclopedic at all  
Yes, but """"is the worst"""" and """"honestly"""" are POV. If we say it's considered to be the worst, no problemo.  
Yeah, then we agree the fact should be there, just rephrased.  

Agreed. That was the most tastless gag ever. It may have been a decent episode, if it were in season 11. Or the repeating of a job for Mr. Burns, or the selling of ones soul. OR the fact of maybe more.""",0.0

I'm not going to revert your last edits; however, there are some things that I want to point out:
 It doesn't matter whether this band is an """"extraordinary case"""" or not. These need still a source and Rate My Music (and similar user-operated websites) have zero validity as a source. What you are doing now is adding genres according to your original research and your point is mostly based on this. Also whether another band page has sourced genres or not is not relevant; this must be necessary, especially for this sort of controversial articles.
 If you have any objections against the guideline, then you may open a discussion on the talk pages. However, you are currently doing whatever you desire and disregard every set of rule. I understand that you're doing this for the article's good and indeed the rules can be breakable if necessary. However, I am really baffled at your persistence on keeping the genres without any discussion or consensus, even after this amount of controversy it has generated. 
 I don't really think having around 65 genres on the infobox (without any sort of necessary prose or explanation in the article body) would be useful at all, especially for the readers.
 And yes, you are right. You are definitely editing the page with a fan's perspective.   """,0.0

Even so, that does not imply that: Mexico could not possibly use any """"generous financial support"""" to buy the arms, ammunition, or other war supplies for the very reason that the U.S. was the only sizable arms manufacturer in the Americas. To make matters worse, Germany could not be counted on to supply Mexico with war supplies directly, as the British Royal Navy controlled the Atlantic shipping lanes.

As the editor 148.247.186.142 has pointed out, Mexico could buy weapons produced in Argentina, or use the Argentinian companies as intermediaries. Moreover, as the same editor also pointed out, the 75% of the fuel used by the British Royal Navy in 1917 was produced in Mexico. Hence, without fuel the British Royal Navy could not control the Atlantic shipping lanes at all. Actually, it is not a coincidence that the UK took Persia in the partition of the Ottoman empire of 1918, considering the fact that the Anglo-Persian oil company was founded there in 1908; and the UK had learnt the lesson: it is really dangerous to depend exclusively on the oil produced in only one foreign country. Well, they learnt the lesson until the oil crisis of 1973. Finally, let us also recall that the US made plans in 1917-1918 for invading Mexico and taking control of Tampico oil fields, but the US also calculated that Mexicans would set in fire the oil fields before they could arrive there; the classical scorched earth technique applied by the Russians against Napoleon and Hitler.

Usually people does not take into consideration that Mexico had a super-weapon in 1917: the oil fields, because mass production of oil in Saudi Arabia began until 1945.189.203.69.72  """,0.0

First problem ParacusForward like most wiki editors you don't understand the subject but wiki functions like a micropedia if they want more information the real people's encyclopaediais called Google. Either you don't understand the problems of getting past the big brother police state of Manipur where people are terrified to report the truth or you don't care. I thought perhaps this might be a place to release info but I noticed the spike in info came from reports available via google. One national tv company followed by a local newspaper broke the story on the death threats and hate mail. Then the gangsters responded in an Indian national tabloid. Now they are trying to put the djinn back into the bottle. I don't think you are necessarily malicious the police and security forces wouldn't have to pay you to supress the truth. You are clearly racist or if you prefer the more encylopaediac term ethnocentric. One of the sources the only one I saw that was completely incorrect is a Chinese Government Human Rights Agency. They are not so hot on Tibet and can be truthful on non chinese human rights abuses but in Manipur they have close links with the major human rights NGO which has long been run by the local police. I am sure things will happen but since you haven't got any interest in updating it none will report it here. I don't believe it is helpful either. Wiki did not allow the 24 hours grace to support to keep my fiancee alive again not out of malice but because of aspergers syndrome. I am sending her Hard Times if you haven't read it Wiki does a good summary they are also good for things like definition of satyagraha but for up to date info Google is the first port of call or Twitter. So anyway good luck with your project but the manner in which a few ignorant racist wiki editors claim ownership of this venture with nobody else having the courage to challenge them in case they too are red handed by a confederacy of dunces will make it less relevant. It is far from accurate or up to date. Mainly because editors like you do not have sufficient background understanding of hte politics and culture of the articles you edit. Before I began editing wiki hadn't updated info for several years. No doubt now you will accept unchallenged the false government reports which because they carry the weight of Chinese Propaganda agencies and local newspapers wholly intimidated by the Manipur State and corrupt police will now stand unchallenged by the editors who look only at code grammar and syntax and have no understanding of hte problems of truth reporting from within a police state of the third world.

Well first I am going to address some basic stuff that will help you ion the future.  Whenever you want to add a new topic to someones talk page, either click on the """"+"""" at the top of the page, and then fill in the header, or you can just add == (your header) == after clicking """"edit this page,"""" and then type your what you want under the header.  This creates the header that you see, which helps to keep convos organized, and after the 3rd or 4th header, your page will automatically have a table of contents, which helps for organization.  Secondly, and most importantly, whenever you add info to a talk page, always sign under your statement  by either typing ~~~~ or by clicking the little signature button in the edit toolbar, this generates your signature and a timestamp which links to your user page.  Now to address your concerns about the info into the article.  The main thing here on Wikipedia is that we cannot have original research which means that information cannot be added unless there is a respectable source to back it up, such as a website, news article, etc.  Just because someone read it somewhere or saw it on TV, doesn't mean it can or should be added to this encyclopedia.  Also Wikipedia is trying to clean up its trivia sections, because for the most part this type of information is not notable enough and it tends to be random.  These trivia sections also tend to be just lists of random information, which Wikipedia is not.  I would recommend that you just let it go, as more than likely, in some time (hopefully sooner than later) all this trivia information will be removed or added into the articles.  I hope you keep on editing though and try to make sure that you stay away from trivia, and to always source your edits.  Thanks!

OK. I look forward to Yosemitesam shedding some light. For the record: although I am officially anonymous, others can verify that they are aware of my identity and that I do not have any COI.

To wax philosophical: one problem is that reality  in this case, historical reality  is often rather complex, ambiguous, and not easily amenable to the facile interpretations sometimes put forward in these and other similar articles.

"Summary of situation  User:ShimShem has taken a dislike to this article, and has tried numerous methods to either get it deleted or its name changed. 
 1) Completely invalid speedy deletion request
 2) Invalid DRV request
 3) Nominated for deletion via AfD, despite the fact that it had passed an AfD this year - in fact the AfD was withdrawn at 6-0 for Keep
 The current AFD here stands at 9-0 for Keep, but despite that, ShimShem has wikilawyered all the way through it - once it became clear that it was going to be kept, they decided a name change would be better...
 4) Changed the name of the band in the article, and was told to take it to talk
 After a brief non-discussion on talk, moved the article anyway, and was reverted

I was originally unsure of the motives of this editor - why they were completely desperate to delete or move this article - until I noted they were interested in Tamil subjects, one of which is M.I.A. (artist), and guessed that they believed that the two could be confused.  Their subsequent creation of the article M I A as a redirect to M.I.A. (artist) proved this, as far as I am concerned.  

As to whether the band is actually called MIA or M.I.A., it differs.  The band itself uses M.I.A. as the heading on their own website, but then uses a combination of both elsewhere.  Since in the case of most sources, this is only likely to be laziness (much as R.E.M. are regularly referred to as REM), and since the article has existed here for a while, and that all the backlinks go to this version, and most of all because we shouldn't let disruptive users get their way, the article should stay here.",0.0

 Doug Weller's prejudice against Richard 'Brad'shaw Watson II & Science: 7 Seals as 'beyond Einstein theories' 

I referred to the scientist Brad Watson and his discoveries of 7 cutting-edge theories that he claims are the """"7 Seals"""" on the cover of his booklet There Are No Coincidences - there is synchronism, design and alignment. I see that Watson has posted on this article and talk page before. Not more than 60 seconds elapsed before Doug Weller came along and not only deleted Science: 7 Seals as 'beyond Einstein theories' from the article, he deleted it from this talk page! That's against the rules of Wikipedia as I understand them. The scientific explanation of the 7 Seals appears to me to be much more logical, legitimate, and a 21st century interpretation/explanation than anything else in this article. It belongs here in the Wikipedia article and that's why I put it here. In a message to me, he attacks Richard Bradshaw Watson II and says """"not to use him as a source anymore"""". That's outrageous! There's a strong prejudice coming from Doug Weller and it's doing a great harm to this very important Wikipedia article and talk page. - Einstein 75.74.130.115  """,0.0

In that sense, I do think it is of due weight with respect to this controversy because it is perhaps part of the aftermath. As it stands, I think that reporting his Titstare comments and people's reaction to them, without mentioning that he was subsequently fired over a history of Twitter comments that were perceived as sexist, etc. (but that he defended as satirical) would be missing the bigger picture. Although I think we have enough sourcing to include his firing and the surrounding controversy, I think that if we decide that it's too irrelevant or too much of a BLP problem to include here, we should take most or all mention of him out rather than giving readers only part of the story. -",0.0

Yesterday head of Palestine's parliment was captured by Israel. This happens every day, and this has occured for years. Israel made this way.

 As I know, and you can read on the top of article, there were small number of Israel citizens killed by Hezbollah rockets, and most of the killed person were IDF soldiers. As I know, there were even two Israeli-arabs between the killed people, that their father told that they were killed in the way of freeing Palestine.

Second, I note with interest that you haven't disputed the substance of the extensive comments made by Capone and me. Like Fred Bauder, you concentrate on popularity—in the limited context of well-fed Westerners who spent their youth searching for reds under the beds.

Third, you red-bait those who claim—correctly—that capitalism kills hundreds of millions of people every decade by withholding food, clean water, and basic medical care. Calling this """"[t]he Stalinist view of the world"""" is a demagogue's tactic.

Fourth, the US, the UK, France, non-Nazi Germany, and other capitalist countries have indeed murdered millions upon millions of their own citizens—or at least of the residents of their territory, whether or not such people were regarded as citizens by the capitalist governments in question. Need I mention the genocide that pushed the indigenous population of an entire hemisphere to the brink of extinction? How about slavery, revolution, civil war, conscription for military adventures abroad?

I'd also like to request (separately) that the sections """"Disclosure of classified material"""" and """"Reaction to disclosures"""" either be merged (with a new subsection """"Reaction""""), or that the """"Reaction to disclosures"""" section be moved to after """"Disclosure of classified material"""".",0.0

 Deletion of """"Finney Ross"""" Master Leathersmith 

Dear Sir,

First off, I apologize if I mess this up, as I am a computer idiot.

My page on Finney Ross ... Master Leathersmith, was removed and I believe that to be an error.

Under section A47 it states """"It does not indicate how or why the subject is notable"""".

Finney Ross was a South Texas Pioneer in leathersmithing for the R.C.A. (at that time the Rodeo Cowboys Association. It has since been changed to the P.R.C.A.: Pro Rodeo Cowboys Association)

His works graced the likes of Larry Mahan, Freckles Brown, Jim Shoulders, Casey Tibbs (just to name a FEW and most are now P.R.C.A. Hall of Fame inductees.)

During Ross's leathersmithing days in the 50's, 60's and 70's ... it was unheard of in the rodeo world to have one leathersmith dominate an entire state. But Ross's works were so sought after, that famous cowboy after cowboy would only reccommend Ross.

To this day, not only are his works highly collectible and valuable because of WHO he was and WHAT he did, but Larry Mahan who is on the board of trustees for the P.R.C.A. still retains all of his Ross items and still speaks of his works and contibutions to the R.C.A. to this day. (You may contact Mr. Mahan to verify) 

The old days of Rodeo and all the history behind it are slowly fading away. I would much appreciate you putting the page back up. I know that it doesn't seem like much of a statement to the world, but in the world of rodeo...it actually is.

Thank you for your time and consideration,

 From the Members
Welcome to the Ninth issue of the WikiProject Christianity newsletter! Use this newsletter as a mechanism to inform yourselves about progress at the project and please be inspired to take more active roles in what we do.  

I am in the process of going through the various categories related to Christianity. I am finding that several of them may not have sufficient number of members to continue. By the end of the month, I hope to have the main category list finished (yeah, it might take that long, it's huge). At that time, I think we will review all the categories and see which may not have sufficient articles to continue. Please feel free to take part in the discussion regading what the minimum number of category items is, and how to deal with the non-qualifying categories, on the General Forum page.

That was really mean. Family Guy and King of the Hill are good shows, but so is KP. Don’t get hostile. =D  
One of the things that make the show unique is that it is a comedy aimed at more than just kids, that doesn't revolve around a cliched 'loser' main character. In fact KP is the complete antithesis of a loser and so are her family and most of her friends. Even Ron doesn't really fit the stereotype.

 No problems then, and candor I have in spades. People around here from Jimbo on down definitely know when I have a peeve, though these days, seems like most I knew well have quit. Loosing people like CBD, Mel Etitis, and David Kernow I really have to chalk up to the endless strife and hostility of these episodic outbreaks of someone creating a dislocating change... Deletions of something just created, qualify for that, if you'll allow the personal reference. I don't hold grudges, as many can tell you, so I'm taking you at your candorous word too!

 Admittedly, the sweetness and light bit gets cloying all the time, so putting some mustard on things is actually compensation for the the otherwise thankless efforts, now and again. I know that's bent, but self-honesty let that out, so may as well admit it. Shaking preconceptions in those that forget WP:IAR is perhaps the best legacy I sometimes think I can give around here... particularly the young folks don't have enough life experience to know when to live and let live and so ignore a rule or guideline... 

This silly series I'm working is a case in point. Ill served by it when I checked our coverage when I stumbled across it in November, I'm compulsed as I have been in many areas here to try improving it, mainly by adding to it, for it was cut by a harsh, ill-judged ruthless person. The original writers went on to other tasks in life's stages, so a nicely put together set of articles covering the series got run over by the mac truck of one guy, aided passively by 2-3 others, pushing the new notability rules so they wiped out hundreds of man-hours of work, in some nifty and salvageable articles. Turned them into around 180 redirects and put together a paltry in-universe list article that had almost zero value... leaving things well enough alone would have been far better. Kidz!!! Sigh.

So take care, again. And mind Frank's 24 hour guideline... Cheers // nkB """,0.0

I agree with you that Boxun is not a reliable source, for a want of solid editorial oversight, and the Reliable Source Noticeboard concurs.

Its Wikipedia article says that some people accuse it of being pro-Beijing, but then again similar accusations appear on the article about the South China Morning Post, which we seem to regard as reliable; the New York Times, which in related discussions Wikipedians seem to regard as reliable, is often accused of having a liberal bias; few newspapers can claim that their coverage is not controversial to some group of people.

The reference clearly refers to a """"close air support"""" version of the F-16 and not a """"ground attack version"""", and I changed the article to reflect as such.  The irony is, even though this close air support version was cancled, the F-16 has engaged in close air support (CAS) in every major conflict (for the U.S.) it has flown in, up to and including present day operations in Iraq.  Your definition of ground attack is skewed.  Ground attack can be many things, including CAS, but also things such as interdiction, where high speed can be very much an advantage for a ground attack aircraft, to help avoid defenses.

"I don't claim. I write according to what scholarship says. If you don't understand the problem, it's because there is no problem.  Both comments above are pointless except to underline an unfamiliarity with the distinction between ancient texts and secondary scholarship. Let me illustrate by using your claim of a contradiction and restating what I said re Moses, as if it dealt with Odysseus, another fictional person.
'Odysseus is a fictional character invented by Homer and Homer's Odyssey is not a source for explaining the etymology of the name.'
No one would blink at that, except . . .
Just as 'Moses/mashah' is a kind of figura etymologica used by the writers to explain a name whose origins they did not know, so too is 'Odysseus/odussamemos'(Ὀδυσεὺς/ὀδυσσάμενος at Od.xix.406ff.).  This is very frequent in ancient literature. Just as modern scholarship doesn't accept the  Biblical etymology for Moses, so classical scholarship has generally disabused itself of the idea, stated by Autolykos, that Odysseus be named  'child of hate/woe' because his grandfather was in wrathful odds with the world.
γαμβρὸς ἐμὸς θυγάτηρ τε, τίθεσθ᾽ ὄνομ᾽ ὅττι κεν εἴπω: 
πολλοῖσιν γὰρ ἐγώ γε  τόδ᾽ ἱκάνω,
ἀνδράσιν ἠδὲ γυναιξὶν ἀνὰ χθόνα πουλυβότειραν:
τῷ δ᾽  ὄνομ᾽ ἔστω ἐπώνυμον:

The ancient Jewish readers of the Bible were quite aware, as we can see from Philo of Alexandria and Josephus, who both proposed an Egyptian etymology. In doing so, they dismissed the folk etymology given in the Tanakh, realizing that that the derivation from the verb 'to draw from' was an infra-Hebrew folk etymology, a kind of Figura etymologica as ancient rhetoric classified such games, that had no value. How could an Egyptian-speaking princess in 1,500 BC be sufficiently fluent in a language that was only attested in that form several hundred years alter, to give Moses a name that would make sense a millennium later? In medieval times, once direct and living contact with antiquity was lost, all sorts of fantastic speculations developed.",0.0

Notice to Zscout370 about SimonP's and GroundZero's Arbitary Deletion

Howdy Zscout370,

This is just to let you know that I enjoyed our conversation very much about my contribution to the Flag of Canada page.  You very very professional, easy going and nice to talk too.  However, SimonP and GroundZero have seen fit to arbitarily deem my additions as """"POV warranting Deletion"""" without any discussion.  I am not happy about such """"blatant editoral presumption"""" on their parts.  I have have no prior dealings with GroundZero, but I am """"well acquainted"""" with SimonP's style.   He loves to add material without references and that retort that they are available in comtemptary Newpaper Articles.   A claim that is quite difficult to double check, as most people are not career librarians, or such.  

At any rate for the time being, I have taken the liberity to move my Republican Tricolour contributions to a separate page, linked below,

See also French Republican Tricolour form of Canadian Maple Leaf Flag.

Just to let yaa know, any blatant deletion/editing of this new page or the link to it on the Flag of Canada page, and I shall be asking you to contact the Administrations TO LOCK BOTH PAGES for Dispute Resolution.

Take care, and best wishes eh,

Westside
You recently deleted my article on Westside, because it was not """"verifiable"""". You said that I needed to have Westside reviewed by newspapers, or something along those lines. My problem with this is that it is not a, um, well known publication, and as such would not likely be reviewed by any newspapers or such. Is there anything I can do (or in other words, what kind of external sources do I need?) to get my article back on Wikipedia? How can I get somebody that you define as reliable to verify that Westside, umm, exists? It just doesn't seem fair that I can't write an article about Westside just because the New York Times doesn't write about it. I thought the purpose of Wikipedia was to make information available to anyone who wants it. Several of Westside's readers have approached Wyatt (the co-creator) about a website to learn more about it, and, as of yet, he has no website to point them to. When he asked me to create a site about it (he's not great with these things) I of course immediately thought """"What better than Wikipedia?"""" Unfortunately, I wasn't aware of the difficulty of putting a simple article up on Wikipedia. I won't deny that this has made me very angry. Is there ANY way for me to get my article back up? There's pretty much no chance that anything like a newspaper will cite Westside. Is there some kind of other source that I can get to review Westside? Also, why was my article initially cited as an attack article? It seemed obvious to me that my description of Tucker and Jason were not in any way insulting, as their apparent lack of intelligence is a character trait. Thanks in advance for your response.""",0.0

So should all """"other albums"""" not have a chronology in their infobox? Is there a rule that all albums have to have a chronology, or can it be removed from albums like Cheap Thrills, Strictly Commercial, Beat the Boots, etc? Removing it all together from those articles and leaving the chronology to the official albums seems like a better way of doing things. 

Also, how should The Old Masters fit in? If all three boxes had their own articles (which they don't), the chronology would read:

Thing-Fish • Francesco Zappa • The Old Masters, Box IFrancesco Zappa • The Old Masters, Box I • Frank Zappa Meets the Mothers of Prevention

'''The Old Masters, Box III • Guitar • You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 1

The problem is that without an article for each box, a reader going through all albums chronologically would end up stuck on the universal Old Masters page, which currently leads to Beat the Boots chronologically. Another reason getting rid of certain infobox chronologies would make sense.

What we have here is five examples of typical church architectural arrangements teamed with five examples of buildings which fit these patterns. The names of the forms follow a convention (in the context of the sentence) and the names of the churches fit a convention (in the context of the sentence).    Changing the wording so that one out of five is different, in order to fit the link, doesn't work, in terms of expression.   

Also, the insertion of the word """"Anglican"""" in the names of the churches is superfluous in the context of the article, as Blacket was working for the Church of England at the time. The insertion of """"Anglican"""" into churches' names is a recent thing, and generally considered unnecessary, elswhere. While links may require the word, the context of the sentence (and most of the article) doesn't, so it's better to link as St Michael's, Surry Hills, until linking in the list below, where the full names of all the churches can be given.

The typical fascist state also embraced militarism, a belief in the rigors and virtues of military life as an individual and national ideal, meaning much of public life was organized along military lines and an emphasis put on uniforms, parades, and monumental architecture.

Hey, thanks for your review of me at ER.  I was previously aware of the naming conventions debate.  It is a tough topic, obviously.  I support a fairly common sense approach to the subject.

"Are you even listening to me? In 1838, the Armenian Oblast (Armenian province) population was numbering of about 165,000 people according to statistics, about half were Armenian(excluding the later 200,000 on its seroundings who later immigrated). In 1924 the population of Azerbaijan was of 2 million, 75% were Azeri Tartars, it compromised of Baku province , Elizavetpol Province and the adjoining districts, (including Nagorno Karabakh and Nakhochevan). From 250-300,000 Armenians were moved from Julfa, Erivan and Nakhichevan in 1604 and following, if you claim that there was even as much Muslim there, you are totally ignoring the history of the period. Since the partial control by the Ottoman, Nakhichevan and Erivan served as depots of goods, intermedary from the Ouest and East, Persia even further pushed that but replaced the Armenians who would rather trade on the Shah's capital. You claim having provided data, but you have provided absolutly nothing, because the only things you have provided, even before I covered them, and what you present in no way contradict what you claim. A projection of that much people (250-300,000), to claim that Tartars at least presented that much in the Western zone, would have been just sensless.

What I have provided.

1-That there were reasons specifically targetting Armenians which do not apply and were not applied to Muslims.

2-I have provided materials excluding the Muslims in reference to the depopulation.

3-I have provided materials equating the population with the word Armenian.

4-I have provided a reference prior to Gultestan Treaty, and you dismissed the author, while in Wikipedia we only present sources and if there exist critics from notable published materials of those sources. What you think of the author is original research.

You answered by presenting 13-14th century and post Gulestan materials, which in no way have I contested nor do they contradict what I have been saying. I have provided figures of Armenian moved, which by projection represent 2 million or more Armenians if projected for 1918, and those excludes the recorded numbers of Armenians who escaped depopulation and inspite of it, there still remained a considerable number of Armenians pre Gulestan, which I also documented. I have documented everything I have been claiming, you request things that do not exist, because there was no Nakhochevan delimitation in that period, nor statistics for a bordering which is quite modern in comparaison to Abbas period.

In short, what you have highlighted is that the word Armenian has no place in this article, and that you have no intention to improve it. You know that what you propose is misleading but you still claim it is neutral. As we speak 98% of Nakhichevan population is Azeri, so claiming depopulation could only be misleading in that it suggest that Azeris were those moved when the Armenians were those mostly affected. Obviously here, we do have a problem, and as it appears, you in no way want to correct it.  (ix)",0.0

LessHeard vanU, may this edit be reverted? I'm only asking this because Abtract made edits to the page before.  (talk • edits) 
I reverted. Per WP:AGF I am not going to ask how you noticed it. Give me a while regarding the second comment.   
I have asked JHunterJ to look into it.   
The prohibition is against """"interacting with, or, directly or indirectly, commenting on each other on any page in Wikipedia"""".  I'm assuming no other intra-party accords have been reached about other restrictions or divisions of labor.  Given that, I'd say thtqa this reversion, in which Abtract reverts an uninvolved user's edit to a version of Sesshomaru's, is clearly fine. Similarly, Sesshomaru could have reverted this edit (an anonymous user's addition to a page also touched by Abtract). On a topic not discussed in this section, Sesshomaru's addition of a dab project tag to create a Talk page for a disambiguation page created by Abtract is also 100% fine.  Could the parties involved reserve the complaints for situations where they actually disagree with the contents of the resulting page, please?    
Thanks J, I've done this as a result of your investigation. I'm willing to resolve the matter, but everyone keeps ignoring a primary concern of mine.  (talk • edits) 

I really do think you have taken a sledge-hammer to crack a nut here guys. Sess and I had all but ironed out our differences and come to an understanding on JHJ's special page; this was sadly undone when Sess misunderstood my friendly farewell note (possibly because he wanted to be seen to support Coll). Left to our own devices I am pretty sure we can co-exist on all pages with Sess taking a minute detailed approach and me being cavalier and missing stuff. If Sess is happy for the restrictions between us to be removed (and I sense that he is) then why not make life easy for all of us and do so? I make no similar comment about Collectonian.   
Actually, if you and Sess are happy to edit without the restrictions, you are welcome to do so  provided you agree with each other to avoid reporting the other to the admins, we will remain blissfully unaware of the activity.    
Think that answers my question. Much appreciated J.  (talk • edits)

"(Sub)Tropical Storm - May 27-28, 1988? 

Check it out. I was trying to find an image for Tropical Depression One in 1988, when I came across this, which looks like a well-organized unclassified storm just off of North Carolina. On May 26 a cold front extended across the western Atlantic Ocean. The next day, a circulation developed to the southeast of Charleston, South Carolina, with much of its convection sheared to the northeast; at the time, it might have still been frontal. Tracking to the northeast, by early the next day the center became more involved with the convection, though only based on interpolation from IR. By the time of the first visible image, it was just off of the Outer Banks of North Carolina, possibly extratropical or subtropical, based on the (presumably) cold air being entrained. Convection deepened, and three hours later it looked tropical, which is where I found the image. Unfortunately, there's no more Atlantic visible images after that due to an error. Nilfanion found this visible satellite image, meaning it must not have been very deep. Here's another, and here's a small one. Verdict? Probably an extratropical cyclone and maybe a subtropical cyclone that had some aspirations to do something.  (talk)",0.0

I am sorry to say Mr.Tosa was not invited to that championship. So what you are telling is not true. Sensei Shukumine never had any contact with Tosa after Tosa turned his back on him and started his own commercial Karate organization. Please see also Sensei Shukumine's personal message at a training seminar in The Netherlands with Sensei Kanai and Sensei Konno. Please see the pictures on the Genseiryu website: Taido and Genseiryu people united to celebrate 55 years Genseiryu - 40 years Taido and to commemorate Sensei Shukumine. Besides that there are pictures of Sensei Shukumine teaching several Genseiryu Teachers like Genseiryu Head Instructor Sensei Kanai in Genseiryu Head dojo situated in Ito Japan in 1996. 212.127.137.2 19:37, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Were you at the championship or something? 
So, if Mr. Tosa never had any contact with Mr. Shukumine after 1962, then please explain these picturse of Mr. Tosa and Mr. Shukumine together on the Brazilian Genseiryu website .  Zzaroc 22:01, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I am sorry I didn't say Sensei Shukumine had any contact after 1962. I said he didn't had any contact after Sensei Tosa turned his back to Sensei Shukumine. This was after Sensei Shukumine wrote the preface for sensei Tosa's book about Genseiryu Butokukai. And yes I was present at the championship in Okinawa amongst other Genseiryu practitioners from Spain, Denmark, Holland, and Japan. I will try to give also a link with pictures of that event. I need a little time for that I am not an Internet black belt sorry for that. 212.127.137.2 22:53, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)

You don't have to be a black belt, when your good, by the way. But take your time, I am patient.
But I was wondering. Mr. Tosa published his book in 1984, but there still a picture of him together with Mr. Shukumine in 1985 (I mean those pictures on the Brazilian site). Then there are still a few questionmarks.
But by the way, did you know that Mr. Tosa received several letters all over the world, just after Mr. Shukumine died? Those letters were asked for permission if some dojo's could join the organization of Mr. Tosa. Mr. Tosa denied these people to join his organization.
There was one person who send such a letter to Mr. Tosa from Holland, and you may guess who.
And I have got also another question. Mr. Seiken Shukumine past away to an hart attack. But when did he started to get ill?  Zzaroc 23:59, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)

No a black belt is not needed to have a certain skill. But in most occasion it shows an amount of training effort,time. And as you probably know training effort makes you become more skillfull.

I don't know when Mr. Tosa turned his back to sensei Shukumine so maybe my remark that they didn't had any contact shouldn't be done by me because I am not aware of that specific date. So I apologize for that. But I heard this occured in the mid till end '80s.

No, I didn't know that Mr. Tosa received several letters from all over the world. I know he claimed to get a letter from Holland. I know he received one which was delivered by someone from Denmark. But I know that the letter was completely different from what is claimed by Mr. Tosa. That is also easy to believe if you are member of a Genseiryu organization in Ito which was directly connected to sensei Shukumine where Sensei Shukumine still gave, in very few occasions, lectures about Genseiryu (pictures are on the way (few days necessary)). So you can imagine you don't beg for acknowledgement by Mr. Tosa who only wants you to train his way, which is very near to Shotokan with the basic kata of Shotokan. This dojo in Holland is not interested in any connection with Mr. Tosa. For what reason, if you want to train Genseiryu the same way as sensei Shukumine taught his students? The Head Instructor of this organization is now Sensei Kanai one of the first students of Sensei Shukumine. In Sensei Shukumine's book """"Shin Karatedo Kyohan"""" there are several pictures of teachers who are still in this group. I met them during the celebrating anniversary of Taido and Genseiryu beginning of this year (Jan. 2005). Many nice teachers who still respect Sensei Shukumine, as should be in the relationship with teacher and student.

I was never involved with the sickness of Sensei Shukumine and I don't like to talk about his sickness. I met Mr. Shukumine one time and talked a little bit with him. In Okinawa I only met him from a distance. So I am sorry I can't anwer this question for I didn't have such a close relationship with Sensei Shukumine.  212.127.137.2 06:48, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)

"Since consensus was to keep, and I still felt strongly that the lack of web accessibility was a problem, I added spans into the List of R-phrases, then converted the R-phrase template to include a #link into the list, only to discover that the link target shadows the title attribute for tooltip purposes. To resolve this, I created redirects into the list with verbose titles like R1: Explosive when dry. Template:R-phrase now links to the list via these redirects, and the redirect titles come up on the tooltip. That way, you get your tooltip, and I get web-accessibility. I hope this makes sense to you.
If ever you chem guys get around to creating separate articles on each R-phrase (and I think you could, with expanded information on the nature of the hazard, standards for storage, transport and use, and a list of chemicals to which the R-phrase applies), then you can either overwrite the redirect with the article, or retarget the redirect at the article.

Hi Ontario Teacher, I need help with a problem at Plurality (voting)? An IP editor keeps placing inchoate text in topics, related to plurality, apparently using several IP addresses. See this edit, in particular, which is similar to a previous one. I don't feel that I can tackle this on my own, so I'm hoping that you can help. I just reverted a reversion the same IP made at Proportional representation, where you corrected one of his edits.

Homosexuality in Ancient Greece

Do homosexuals like you get turned on at the thought that these great ancient people's may have accepted homosexuality? Why do you have to distort history to fit your image? 

first off there is no concrete evidence that alexander liked it up the butt...let's get that straight...no pun intended

second i'm sure there was gay shit back in the day, like in every culture...but i don't believe everyone was doing it....just because you find two pots out of a 1000 that show some gay act...doesn't mean everyone back then was gay

third...there is a difference between brotherly love and being gay or a pedophile...i say i love my friends and in greece i even kiss them on the cheek when i see them..that doesn't mean i want their ass...look at shaq and wade slapping each other's ass in basketball are you telling me they are gay?

fourth...just because some plays back in the day reffered to certain people being gay...doesn't mean they were...alot of plays (especially comedies) were made to be critical or make fun of people by dehumanizing them or making them look stupid...like calling them gay...just look at comedies now making fun of people...someone might say the president today is gay in a comedy skit, but we all know he is straight

fifth...i hate gay propaganda...i know they are people blah blah blah...but to try to impose on a great culture some of their values to justify their way of life is pathetic...just because there are no great gay people in history doesn't mean you have to ripout pieces of history to make your people look good....from alexander to hitler to lincoln...you guys try to change history or make things up to fit your own cause

i leave with quotes from two authors who wrote gay stuff on alexander

Some modern historians point out that the ancient sources cannot be considered definitive. Robin Lane Fox writes: """"Later gossip presumed that Bagoas was Alexanders lover. This is uncertain."""" [16] And, according to Mary Renault, who wrote a novel about the relationship of Alexander and Bagoas, """"No historian states plainly whether they were physical lovers."""" [17]

key words: uncertain, no historian

I think that in a dispute over whether it is a variant we should error on the side of accepting the variant provided sources can be found. In general I would agree with correcting it to honorary unless it's a Canada article and the sources use honourary.

""""That sentence assumed that there was wrongdoing. The rest of that section still implies it by the juxtaposition of the funding information with the report details. You may think that this is obvious, but we need a source that explicitly states that the findings of the the UT report were influenced by the funding received.""""Perhaps personal correspondence with the authors of the Texas study admitting their findings were indeed swayed by the knowledge that the business interests of major donors to their institution and research programmes would likely be substantially affected in the negative if said findings did not produce a clean bill of health for fracking? I mean, that's about the only way you could ever meet your demand. What an utterly absurd request. It's easy to see why it was made, though: just set the bar so high it can't be jumped, then use the failure as an excuse to chop out what you don't like. Maybe you'd have me hack the e-mail accounts of the authors, fish around for evidence (assuming there is even any there), then leak it to a major newspaper so they can write an article that I can cite on here. Only the most naive idiot can fail see the potential for conflict of interest from a study put out by Texas. The university's state is the heart and soul of US oil & gas, but that's certainly not worthy of so much as a mention given that which is also true: the university has multi-million-dollar and other links with the largest provider of fracking services in the United States, not to mention other oil & gas companies with interests in fracking. I have no idea whether their report was swayed by industry links, but only a fool would suggest the potential isn't there. If you don't like the juxtaposition, just open up a gap with a caveat—and make it as weak, pathetic and denigrating as you like for all I care, maybe something like, """"socialist—nay, communist!—campaigners in the pay of a European Maoist group have alleged a potential for a conflict of interest, noting that..."""" For comparison, take the recent global-warming sceptics at the Heartland Institute: as soon as details of the Institute's funding were leaked, they were prominently reported in the press. We don't even need leaks here, the information is freely available to anyone who takes the time to find it out, as Smm201`0 and others have done. All you are interested in doing is eliminating even mention of perfectly obvious potential for conflict of interest. According to Ian Urbina, we can't even get a decent, untarnished report out of the EPA; unlike Texas, the EPA doesn't even take industry funding, for god's sake, yet still it can't escape heavy industry pressure to redact. Aside from irrelevances like minor earthquakes, I have no idea whether fracking is causing all the problems it is alleged to, though I am extremely suspicious given the documented efforts of industry (and their paid-for puppets in government) to tone down or eliminate negative findings, and the truly just ridiculous claims about fracking's potential by people like Lord Browne here in England. And I couldn't care less if fracking's safe or not. Why should I? or anyone? If it's not, it's not; if it is... it is! Outside of a lunatic asylum, who would care? If it is safe (enough), bring it on: jobs, tax receipts, increased energy security, reduced use of coal burning... only a fool wouldn't be interested in those things, particularly given the current economic situation. What I don't like are those desperate only to hear what they want to hear making up totally unreasonable tests so they can get rid of what they regard as offending material.~   00:59, 28""",0.0
