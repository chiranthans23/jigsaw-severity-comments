I understand I am a bit late in this discussion and it has probably already concluded and everyone is probably already over it but I have to say the following; American English is quite simply English for the stupid man (and of course your country would require it.) Your version of English is over-simplified. 
I am sick of Americans always thinking that their way is the only way. Why shouldn't you accept our spelling?
 Webster was incorrect in his changing of the English language. If I was to start spelling things incorrectly would that mean that it is a new way of spelling and I would be a reformist rather than an idiot? I think not. 09:04, 17",0.14285714285714285

 Gabriel Olutola 

There are some issues with Gabriel Olutola, which I just deleted.

I had previously identified some concerns with this article. You seem to understand that there were issues and agreed to address them. We let some time elapse so you could address them, but you did not make any substantive progress toward resolving the problems.

In addition, you are not communicating in a way that is desirable for editors. You are perfectly free to remove material from your talk page (although archiving is generally considered preferable). However, if you simply remove material and do not respond, it is difficult to understand your thinking. I don't know for example, whether you felt that you cured the copyright problems, or perhaps thought that the source of the text was an acceptable source. If you explain your actions it will be easier to help you.

I recently deleted the article because it had copyright problems and I saw no action by you to address them. I now see that you have restored the article in substantially the same form as the article that was deleted. Again, if you do not communicate I do not know what you are thinking. I don't know whether you thought it was deleted in error, whether you thought you cured the problem, or something else.

I notice that the version you restored is not exactly worded the same way as the source. However, we have seen editors who think that changing a word here or there cures a copyright problem. It does not. Please read the following link for more information: Wikipedia:Close paraphrasing

I also ran a duplication detector which does not pick up close paraphrasing, it only picks up exact matches. Even with this cruder measure the article is problematic. I'll provide the link below so you can see the results. However, I emphasize that changing a word or two here or there to eliminate the exact matches is not the cure.

Duplication Detector

Unfortunately, we have identified other articles with issues. I haven't had a chance to look closely but we may be following up with other articles which need addressing.

I urge you to take this quite seriously. If you are editing with a misunderstanding of policy we can help you understand the rules. If you do understand the rules and ignore them, you may be blocked. Explaining your actions will be the best way to ensure that doesn't happen.(Talk) """,0.0

You interpreted the text differently, but I don't recall a case where the information in the article text was at variance with the information in the book. TH1980's interpretation of the text was presumably similar to my own. Sometimes your interpretation of sources is rather unique, but if you just consider the basic question of whether the facts presented in the book match the facts presented in the article, then there was never really much of a problem. I think TH1980 and myself look at the sources in a more straightforward and conservative manner.
The reason why I know that TH1980 has access to the sources is because, firstly, he explicitly mentioned having access to Henshall and other sources during the good article review, and secondly, he himself has cited these books in the article. You can surely see that the answers to your questions are much more straightforward than sinister. Off-topic questions have filled up the talk page before, but none of it actually achieved anything.

 Esperanza Elections 

Hey Banes! I wish to say thanks for your vote at the Esperanza elections.

I've made my way into the Advisory Committee, so if you ever need any help or have any queries about the stuff we do, please do not hesitate to ask. Thanks again,  

Hi Banes! A note from me too, thanks for your vote! Like KnowledgeOfSelf said, please let us know if there's anything we can do for you! You know where to find me -) eB 

 RfA thanks 

Thank you for voting on my RfA, it passed with a final tally of 68/0/0 so I'm now an administrator. If there's anything I can do to help, you feel I've done something wrong, or there's just something you want to tell, don't hesitate to use my talk page. Thanks. -  

 Protected areas 

Hi Banes...glad to hear from you. I am about to close down shop here but will get back to you later...you'll be long asleep, but will post all I have to your usertalk so you can get busy tomorrow...surf around in the Wikipedia:WikiProject Protected areas and I see there is a handy map and template all ready to go... 

Did you need any more links to get you started? I can help you find links that will assit you with the latitude and longitude and area of the parks in S. Africa. a good one is here and it lists most parks and protected areas. Click search for sites, then serach by country, query South Africa and it will provide some pieces of info that may be helpful with the infobox. Let me know if there is anything else you need for this. 

 Thanks!

 Re: Block Log on user 62.171.198.5 

Sir, I wish to ask if you would consider extending the ban on this IP for the persistent and annoying way they seem to wish to disrupt the wikipedia.  Previous bans of 24 and 31 hours have obviously slowed things down, but the IP is reported as belonging to Research Machines Inc, and its understood that abuse of this IP would result in reports of network abuse to be passed to them.  

The IP has an extraordinarily long list of vandalism attached to its name, and I can barely find one edit under the user contributions which is not, or does not amount to outright vandalism.  Could I please ask therefore that you consider extending this ban to 48 hours or thereabouts.  Previous bans seem to have had no effect since the talk page for this IP is full of bans and vandalism warnings.  

Please understand that I would never question the decision of an administrator, as I am not one myself and would consider that the height of rudeness.  All I ask is whether you could please reconsider the ban and possibly extend it.  Thank you.    Thor's pet yack

 Worst Season ever 
Anyone who likes Seasons 4 and onward have obviously NOT seen any of the old episodes from 1999-2004 and therefore is a total dickbag. I can never tell you how much I HATE the new SpongeBob!!! Nick had stopped caring about good animation and started caring only about the cash the SECOND they started this show. The old ones are great, while the new ones, I'd give an F plus 500 million minuses! I'd be so damn shocked if anybody even likes these new episodes, because anyone who does is downright retarded. It's like all Nick's staff wants to do now is win themselves a bunch of hot girls!

When the stooges at Nick began this show, it was nothing but great humor for 5 years. Now, SpongeBob's crew had lost ANY sight of what """"good quality"""" is all about! The writing is totally fucked up! I mean, Seriously, """"For Here or To Go""""? Who the fucking hell would watch an episode about taking orders at a fast food restaurant deciding whether or not to eat it at the restauraunt or home? I know there are now just copying off ideas of old episodes. Ex: Petsitter Pat. Patrick says the bath is gonna come to Gary. That's EXACTLY what SpongeBob said to Gary in """"Gary Takes a Bath"""", but that version is WAAAAAAY better than this new junk that anybody likes is mentally challenged and obviously hasn't watched the first three seasons! Even true SpongeBob fans should only like Season 1-3, because no episodes past that were even remotely decent. And I know for a fact it will never be as good as it used to be. I'm 100% certain that is true. ANYBODY who likes anything of the Post Movie era is just either brain-dead or childish. Stephen Hillenburg really knew quality, but now we just have a bunch of screwed-up polesmokers who only want the money. And NOTHING else! They're just like fucking Mr. Krabs clones! Paul Tibbit must be drunk or something, and Tom Kenny must have swallowed a slide whistle, because now SpongeBob is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING EXCEPT FOR UTTER GARBAGE THAT IS ALL BUT INTOLERABLE!!! Like I said, I cannot believe there are people that actually LIKE these new episodes! Everybody that likes Seasons 4-8 smoke too much crack! Anybody who's into the new SpongeBob doesn't know shit about quality if it hit him square in the ballsack! All I can say is, I am SO RELIEVED this show is ending in 2014. Only 2 more years of this trash that I will have to sit through! If they make a SpongeBob Channel, they should only do reruns of the first three seasons, because absolutely nothing afterwards was good. So there goes 7 years of my life I know I will never get back.

Thank you for taking the time to make your comments. The recognition of your """"Having professionals who contribute their talents at Wikipedia is a great thing and helps advance the project"""" comment is most appreciated and highly agreed upon.

Unfortunately the involvement of contributors such as 'BertieBasset' ( who should be deprived computer access and is hopefully sterile for the sake of future generations ) detracts from the efforts of

Yeah, I love Dogs of Rigait was the first Wallander novel I read. I can understand why they skipped that in the first series (there's no point in them saying """"Hey! Watch this brand new TV series about a Swedish detective! Oops he's off to Latvia now!"""") And I understand why they skipped The White Lioness (because of the Africa scenes, and I find it really boring...). I just wish they'd done Faceless Killers last year so that they could fill in Wallander's background for viewers and establish Rydberg as his mentor. Plus they completely ignored Linda's suicide attempt, so she just comes across as a whinging emo brat instead of having a deep reason for her fractured relationship with Kurt. I'm really worried about they'll do with The Man Who Smiled. It's my favourite of the novels and I can't help but think of the huge chunks they'll cut out of it.   """,0.0

 Prof Rachel Baskerville´s Capital Maintenance contribution 

Prof Baskerville,

You are not allowed on Wikipedia to qoute yourself. It is called Conflict of Interest. This is a Wikipedia policy.

I may quote or add comments from your excellent work to Wikipedia, but, you cannot do it yourself. 

Your contribution which is a direct quote from your SSRN publication is also not encyclopedic - as they say over here on Wikipedia.

I also disagree with what you are stating. We can discuss this matter here on this discussion page as it is normally done on Wikipedia. I appreciate that you are new on Wikipedia and that you are a well known and top of the class academic.

Herewith then the contribution from Prof Baskerville that I removed from the article:

""""This the IASB Framework  describes (as above) how capital maintenance is undertaken in two ways:
Firstly, “A financial concept of capital is adopted by most entities in preparing their financial statements. Under a financial concept of capital, such as invested money or invested purchasing power, capital is synonymous with the net assets or equity of the entity”. 
So most entities undertake to report that they have maintained their financial capital and do not report physical capital maintenance. 

Secondly, you may find some public sector entities consider that their stewardship responsibilities are best served by also reporting physical capital maintenance e.g. is the capacity of the waterworks, waste water system etc in the local town the same as, or better, than it was last year? Some Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) will be chosen to report this. The Framework states:
“Under a physical concept of capital, such as operating capability, capital is regarded as the productive capacity of the entity based on, for example, units of output per day”.  These are two ‘concepts of capital’. 

Thirdly, and this is confusing, a legal meaning in the UK arose as follows: English law developed the ‘doctrine of capital maintenance’ with the aim of ensuring that a company cannot return its share capital back to its shareholders as dividends. The ‘doctrine of capital maintenance’ underpins the legal rules addressing

-TABpayment of dividends to shareholders;
-TABreduction of a company’s share capital or reserves;
-TABa company’s purchase of its own shares

and other aspects. From October 2008 private companies in the UK will be allowed to reduce their share capital without the need to go to court"""".
So when a commercial lawyer is discussing capital maintenance they may be referring to this third concept.Baskerville, Rachel F., 100 Questions (and Answers) About IFRS (January 24, 2010). Available from SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1526846

Isn't it generally recognized that 'bon' believes are quite different than other Buddhist beliefs? Anyway, enough speculation. Powers says"""" Bon is commonly considered to be the indigenous religious tradition of Tibet, a system of shamanistic and animistic practices performed by priests called shen (gshen) or bonpo (bon po). Although this is widely assumed by Buddhists, historical evidence indicates that the Bon tradition only developed as a self-conscious religious system under the influence of Buddhism."""" http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/tibet/understand/bon.html is a very good article on the topic.

I don't think it is right to take the world consensus as the right stance to take in this issue. Terms like 'coup d'etat' have great weight in international politics, and using it implies unconstitutionality, illegality, and wide disapproval within the country itself. Left-wing governments like Venezuela will obviously disagree with the takeover. It is unsurprising that the USA also disagrees with it, Obama probably trying to not look like he is a leader that supports military removals of leaders in South America. The EU and other international bodies like the UN disagree with it because any stance otherwise will look like they do not support supreme state sovereignty. Although I can not support these claims with evidence, the fact is that bias in their responses may possible exist, and therefore using international response as the basis for naming something like this which is a POV is inherently creating bias in the article itself.

Also, this is not a European book, per se, rather a book written by a New Spanish peninsular who had spent a lifetime in the territories writing its history (also an important source for studies of the Virgin of Guadalupe, and a significant author of mexican mestizaje). I understand that there are other versions that are not written (bernuzzi, 1981, for example, has some of these - though they are more modern textualized acquisitions), nonetheless at the time of Florencia's text he is indicating that there is something of a lack of memory. Further to this, the assertion that the cave deity was indeed Ostoc Teotl (or some version thereof) is a result of subsequent authors' use of the Florencia text (ie. Joaquin Sardo, 1810), and as far as can be ascertained, a rather modern innovation as well. (  )",0.0

Hello
Hi Harebag!  Welcome!  When I saw the article on the Pigeon Force Police 
Department, I thought it was a joke.  It is real.  I also started a new article on Larry Buendorf.  He's a secret service agent that wrestled a presidential assassin to the ground.  Any suggestions for improvement, let me know.  As for your article, I suggest a little background.  Mention the city and state name.  Fix the link.  Good Luck on editing!  

Additional suggestions for Pigeon Force PD: Who's the chief? Any major history? Big crime solved? Any controversy or major lawsuit against it? When was it established? Was the area patrolled by the county sheriff before then and then the city was established (if so when?).  These are just tips.  Otherwise, there is a risk that someone will petition for the article's deletion because there is a board for that (thus destroying your hard work).  That's the reason that I wrote quite a bit about my new article first rather than just start out with a few sentences and add to it slowly.  I do plan to add more to my article, though.

There is external link in the article which isn't added by me. Please, look the text in it - """"Muslims in Macedonia belong to five ethnic groups. These are Albanians, Turks, Roma, Muslim Macedonians ( also known as Torbeshi, Pomaks or Poturs) and Bosnians"""".....""""A Greco-Turkish Convention on the Obligatory Exchange of Populations in 1923 made some 390,00 Muslims mostly Turks, but also some Pomaks (Torbesi)-leave for Turkey (Ortakovski, 1997:133)"""". Is this text is about the same people or it isn't?
The question about the other two names is the same and there is sources from nowadays which proved it. The book by Russian author Dmitriy Labauri is from 2008. The term there is Bulgarian Pomaks. Through the good finding, made by Подпоручикъ we have a reference to Fihret Adanir. The term used by him is Bulgarian Muslims. Between other references there is a book Поп Антов, Христо. Спомени, Скопje 2006 (Pop Antov, Hristo. Memoires, Skopje 2006). The author used consistently the term Pomaks, describing these people, but the editor (Professor Zoran Tododrovski from Republic of Macedonia) have not considered it necessary anywhere in the book to explain what that means (if the term is ineligible) or that this is outdated term.

Basic concept of GPS
A GPS receiver calculates its position by precisely timing the signals sent by GPS satellites high above the Earth. Each satellite continually transmits messages that include
 the time the message was transmitted
 satellite position at time of message transmission
The receiver uses the messages it receives to determine the transit time of each message and computes the distance to each satellite using the speed of light.  Each of these distances and satellites' locations define a sphere.  The receiver is on the surface of each of these spheres when the distances and the satellites' locations are correct. These distances and satellites' locations are used to compute the location of the receiver using the navigation equations. This location is then displayed, perhaps with a moving map display or latitude and longitude; elevation or altitude information may be included. Many GPS units show derived information such as direction and speed, calculated from position changes.

In typical GPS operation, four or more satellites must be visible to obtain an accurate result.  Four sphere surfaces typically do not intersect.  Because of this, it can be said with confidence that when the navigation equations are solved to find an intersection, this solution gives the position of the receiver along with the difference between the time kept by the receiver's on-board clock and the true time-of-day, thereby eliminating the need for a very large, expensive, and power hungry clock.  The very accurately computed time is used only for display or not at all in many GPS applications, which use only the location. A number of applications for GPS do make use of this cheap and highly accurate timing.  These include time transfer, traffic signal timing, and synchronization of cell phone base stations.

Although four satellites are required for normal operation, fewer apply in special cases. If one variable is already known, a receiver can determine its position using only three satellites. For example, a ship or aircraft may have known elevation. Some GPS receivers may use additional clues or assumptions such as reusing the last known altitude, dead reckoning, inertial navigation, or including information from the vehicle computer, to give a (possibly degraded) position when fewer than four satellites are visible.

This brings us to the question of exclusive use of translations, which bring their own conscious and unconscious baggage which cause differences between the original and the translation.  I suggest that where possible, both the original and the translated versions be cited. For instance Mary Alice Waters' translation of """"Episodes of the Cuban Revolutionary War"""" ISBN 0873488245 is affected both by her marxist ideology, and her lack of familiarity with the Cuban milieu, especially that of the Sierra Maestra and ethnic roots.  To Waters the Sierra Montuno, inheritor to the Taíno, Cimarrón and Mambí cultures wild, armed and dangerous is a mere peasant.  In addition, one should take into consideration the authors’ own biases, Guevara was a tireless self-promoter, as were and still are many powerful figures in history, from Ramses II to Columbus, and Batista to Kissinger.

_______________________

>Hello Beaumont,I noticed that you have recently joined the Dzierzon discussion and especially Dzierzon's self-identification. You may want to read his own biography and look at his family photos at [56].
What exactly the autobiography is supposed to prove? That he wrote German. And where he identifies himself as German? And what the photos suppose to proof?
>He himself states that his mother Maria and father Simon had a small farm in the same place in Silesia. In other words they were longtime burghers of Silesia, as well as him.
Yes there was. “Name of his great-grandfather Jerzy (1717-1800) appears in the oldest Polish chronicles of Lowkowitz “(W. Kocowicz 1987).
>You look at the church records with birth, marriage, death from Lowkowitz and surrounding area and all his Dzierzon family members, who all wound up after 1945 in Western Germany and you find no traces at all of either him or his parents having moved from Poland to Silesia, Germany.
It only proof that the official language was German and Germanization was on the way look V. Raczek, Erinnerungeu all den Altmelster der Bienenzuclit Dr. Dzierzon
>His grave stone also identifies him as Johann Dzierzon.
The grave stone is repeatedly mentioned by many as proof. The stone was funded by Austrian Beekeepers’ Association and have nothing to do with Dzierzon’s family will. I already mentioned about it in earlier part of the discussion. Lokk up.
>The only Polish people, who came to the Silesian town, I find reference to, is by the way on the current Polish Kluczbork.. (?) site, which tells us that Protestant Polish people took refuge there in the 1600's. We all know, that the Counter-Reformation and the Jesuits 'convinced' the Silesians and others to re-catholizise. Perhaps that is, where Johann Dzierzon had gotten his surname from.
You like to forgot that orginal population of Silesia was Polish people. Look for “Recoveret Teritories” article. The orginal Polish language survived for hundred od years. (It is not exceptional facts you can found such event on Lithuania and others countries where the native language was not changed in vilages) As you can imagine because the schools were fewer.
>I have not seen any self-description of him by himself as a Pole.
I am not surprised of it. German do not publicized such thinks. You need read Polish. You have editions by Polish authors in English. You can find them in “Literature” sections. Also you disbelieve recent Polish authors but you believe on NSDAP propagandists Karl Fleischer (his editions are 50-70 years old). I ask many times for recent German beekeeping historians who says Jan Dzierzon was German.
>The wikipedia Polish group, lead by A Serafin, who is also Nr. 131.. are the only ones with a note from a 1961 book, which is added to the incorrectly named Jan Dzierzon wikipedia article.
The correct name of Jan Dzierzon is Dzierżon the z is with dot above. “Dzierżyć” means to keep in Polish language. What do you mean a note from 1961. All Polish beekeeping historians says Dzierzon was Polish. You just disregard parts which are inconvenient.
>This not only claims, that he said that, but insisting on, that he actually did say that. Where is the actual proof? 
In Kluczbork museum. There is many more interesting thinks about the Polish Dzierzon family and their testimonies. I will encourage you to find proof of yours statement JD was German. Nobody yet give me one except the NSDAP propagandists Karl Fleischer scribbles. Autobiography do not say anything of such, we already know it, is not? 
>That quote, supposedly from him,'identifying himself as a Polish person', actually just says, that his surname is a Polish-based surname.
The citation say: “Regarding my nationality, I AM obviously, just as my name says, Polish of birth, since on Silesia people speak Polish…” in Polish version is: """"Samo moje nazwisko mówi, żem Polak z urodzenia"""" which is “just my name says I AM Pole of birth” Further the sentence says: “because from 10 birthday I found myself in Breslau and I studied there I become German educated, but the education does not accept borders or nationality.” I did not include the other part before as I avoided irritating Germans chauvinists. Now you have it.
Original Polish text: „Co do mojej narodowości, jestem oczywiście, jak już samo nazwisko moje mówi, Polakiem
z urodzenia, gdyż na Śląsku mówi się po polsku, a że od 10 roku życia znalazłem się we Wrocławiu i tam studiowałem, stałem się Niemcem z wykształcenia. Ale nauka nie uznaje granic ani narodowości.”
Original in Museum of. J. Dzierżona in Kluczborku, sygn. 35, 14, 11 Folge, Zur Charakteristik Dr. J. Dzierzon.

"Well I would certainly agree with Hugh Schofield, the BBC man in question, and with the editor who included Levy's remarks. Certainly they're very notable for the affair and of course Levy is very eminent. But what struck me about the original contribution was that it was sourced to the BBC in general  ... 'the BBC notes' rather than to somebody at the BBC. No British writer would ever do that because of course the BBC aims, rather like Wikipedia, to provide balanced coverage and offers a representative range of views. It would be rather like an English writer citing a remark of Jean-François Kahn's but sourcing it instead generically to Marianne. There are a number of British journalists who specialise on France of which | John Lichfield is my favoiurite. This is JL on the Houellebecq-Wikipedia affair. He also wrote a very perceptive review of Platform, one of the few French novels I've struggled through in the original, and which I thought was anarchically funny though I do finds 'Wally' rather bleak.

"Historical evidence for Pakhtun origin of Tanawalis now also know as Tanolis

I have given many sources for the Pakhtun origin theory. Also I have written a critical analysis of the various issues concerning the language, culture, history and relationships with fellow Pakhtun tribes of Tanawalis e.g. Jaduns, Dilazaks, Swatis etc. who all live adjacent to the Tanoli areas and have intermarried and share valleys, lands and language. Tanoli, Pakhli and Mansehra as well as Abbottabad's Orush valley are all territories that are similar in many ways and are central to the Hazara identity and culture. The references given by the Janjua theorist are definately fradaulent as this writer has consulted the original material and not found any references to Janjuas or raja Tanoli anywhere. The books by the twn Janjua writers, who do not belong to the great tanawali race but are northern Punjabis whose sources are dubious to say the least and who are trying to concoct a 'history' that has no historical foundation. Furthermore, the history of a people is determinded by it's own oral and written accounts. The ruling family of Tanawal do not list Raja Tanoli in their geneological table nor does he figure in their family accounts - are they wrong, deluded or should we accept their version of their own history which is consistent with those written by non-Tanawalis. abbasid accounts , for a very small minority of Tanolis, is more plausible than a Janjua 'history'. 17:06, 25 October 2006 (Pakhtun Tanoli)",0.0

"""

First, you added information that was NOT CORRECT, except for the reason you gave for Yepes's death. And it is not constructive to to add biased, unneutral opinions like Yepes was the most """"notorious""""...

Second, it is a well-established fact that RAMIREZ and Yepes invented his ten-string guitar. As I said, Bernabe was an apprentice at the Ramirez shop then, but the first Yepes-type ten-string guitar was a RAMIREZ guitar. Moreover, Ramirez had the idea to construct a guitarra d'amor with multiple string resonators INSIDE the body of the guitar. This was rejected by both Segovia and Yepes as impractical. It was Yepes who solved the theoretical and technical problems by adding only 4 strings tuned a very specific way (C, A#, G#, F#) alongside the normal 6 strings. You want a verifiable source? Here: Ramirez III, Jose. 1994. """"The Ten-String Guitar"""" in Things About the Guitar. Bold Strummer. pp. 137-141. [ISBN-10: 8487969402]

Third, I clearly said Yepes fretted bass notes even when the same bass notes were available as open strings! F# or G# are very often played fretted rather than open! I have this in his own handwriting and own fingering yet you will presume to know better and call this fact """"worthless"""" because it disproves your ignorant (unconstructive) remark about Yepes' """"short hands"""" being a reason for playing a 10-string guitar. Furthermore, Yepes frequently uses the 7th fretted (because it is the lowest string), but not """"frequently"""" the 8th (as you mistakenly claim), which is a minor 7th higher than the 7th string. Moreover, these strings can be used to voice chords as originally written in the urtexts by non-guitarist composers like Ponce or Rodrigo that are impossible on the 6-string (except in the edited versions). Being able to use open strings as """"crutches"""" for a lack of technique was certainly NOT part of Yepes's entirely musical reasons for inventing his guitar - though (I will add) many ten-string guitarists today (who are second-rate guitariats in general) have adopted the instrument to make up for weak techniques. This has NOTHING to do with Yepes's own performance practice on his instrument. As someone who has studied for over a decade with one of Yepes's leading (long-term) students, as someone who has thoroughly researched all aspects of the 10-string guitar, as someone who has access to many many unpublished manuscripts and annotations, I can safely say that I know what I am talking about. Yepes even frets A2 and G2# on the 10th string rather than play them on the open A2 and G2# strings (5 and 9) in an example I have in his own handwriting, and the reasons for doing so are in the context entirely MUSICAL and not about any technical limitations, which exist only in your imagination!

Really? Puny pictures in which you can almost not see what her eye color is. You need a magnifying glass to see her eyes. Don't show such pictures cuz it just looks really sloppy and desperate, which in your case makes sense. 1(By magnifying this image up to 400%, you can clearly see her eye color looks sort of olive green, not anywhere close to brown). 2(What the f*** is this? It look horrendous. Oh and her eyes are lighter than her hair and you keep saying they're the same shade, when clearly they're not. Lets take a look at a better quality image. No brown eyes here.)

3(These eyes can still be called hazel.) 4(Hazel eyes due to their nature have the tendency to look goldish brown in certain lights, and look at Belle's hair it looks red). 5(I can clearly see her eyes are not the same as her hair, in fact take a close look when a lock of hair falls in front of her right eyes and clashes with her eyes color. The difference looks brown and hazel, instead of brown and light brown.) 6(That's not a screenshot, and by magnifying the image, her eyes look dark hazel and so not the same color as her hair) 7(400% zoom in, hazel eyes) 8(What a desperate image, you can barely see anything, 1000% zoom in and her eyes appear not to be brown again). 9(400% zoom in, hazel eyes... again)

Oh yes, the Belle merchandise that has her with brown eyes is so big, only one of the pictures you send can sort of qualify. 10 (By magnifying the image up to 400%, you can clearly see her eyes look green-like). 11(400% zoom in, hazel eyes AGAIN)

JESUS F***ING CHRIST. You preseted me with like 18 images and almost all of them have Belle with hazel eyes instead of brown. ARE YOU COLORBLIND? Don't you know how to differentiate colors. An you call this SOLID? If Belle's eyes are hazel, than those are indeed solid, verified evidence. And the screenshots aren't even from the Diamond Edition, they're from the Special Edition.

Take a look at these pics, please. Think anyone will believe you that her eyes are brown? I don't think so. These are just a couple of additions to the pictures you presented, further cementing that Belle has hazel eyes instead of brown. Since hazel is a mix of brown and green and that hazel eyes vary between almost green to almost brown, on what bases are people suppose to believe Belle's eyes are brown?

 OneGuy's vanadalism of the discussion page 
Aside from OneGuy deleting other user's comments, he has now begun to blatently disorganize and effectively vanadalize people's comments: he distrupting the flow of users' comments by arbitrarily cutting off paragraphs and inserting his comments in between, instead of being civil and adding his reply to the end of a given post. Combined with his ceasless personal attacks, false accusations, and insistance on making wikipedia a propoganda machine for Islamist apologetics of the blackest kind, his behaviour has become completely intolerable, and I do not see any point in constantly refuting the same false accusations and false assertions over and over again. OneGuy must be ejected from this discussion before it can have any hope of being a civiled and productive debate. I am left with no choice but to completely resign from this discussion, since it seems that no one is going to be moderating OneGuy's behaviour anytime soon.  Pename

What's ironic is that OneGuy claims he is not a muslim and therefore can not be considered an Islamic apologist!  In fact, most of the Muhammad/Islam apologists here claim to not be Muslim!  Looks like Muhammad's best friends are the infidels.  

As of moderating OneGuy's behavior, the Arbitrators are looking into him and myself after he filed a hypocritical arbitration request against me and I thus filed a countercomplaint against OneGuy.  Whenever OneGuy spots someone who doesn't agree with his radical apologistic viewpoint he tries to silence them by any means at his disposal.  OneGuy, in his complaint in arbitration, accused me of rivert(sic) wars and having POV in my contributions yet he does the exact same thing, only more so.  In the arbitration complaint, the arbitrators don't seem as concerned about the POV contributions as they do about personal attacks, revert wars and my vandalism of his user page. See Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/168.209.97.34.  When OneGuy was giving evidence against me he incorrectly called a few minor word changes as a revert war (even though the change were only made once or twice) and he clearly left out the revert wars in which he was involved (but the arbitrators were not fooled - they found him out).

Since the arbitrators will probably not do anything about his radical apologistic contributions, they will most likely respond to his vandalism of the talk pages.  Feel free to post your complaints regarding OneGuy on Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/168.209.97.34/Evidence.    06:56, 9 Dec 2004 (UTC)

 Since when replying on talk page has become vandalism? Only one time I deleted Pename comments when he cut and pasted his comments that were already on the page on top of my response in a new section that I created (""""death to critics""""). Pename has ignored what we are discussing and is resorting to personal insults and false accusations (in violation of wiki policy) that I vandalized the talk page. He now claims that he did not copy the verse from anti-Islamic site. If true, where did he find the interpretation that 8:67 means kill prisoners of war? He implied that interpretation in the article. At worst, the verse condemns the behavior of taking prisoners in order to make money, but he has not given his source that says 8:67 means kill prisoners. Instead of answering where he found that interpretation (if not anti-Islamic site), Pename is resorting to personal insults and outright lies that I vandalized the talk page  18:46, 6 Dec 2004 (UTC)

 A week at the Tito article 

Hi Guys,

I know that what I said to you in my outburst, the one that earned me a weekend in the cooler, was wrong. Of course it was. I apologise to you for that. A week later, however, I think you can see what we are up against here in the 'Balkan' domain. AndreaFox entered a post at ANI which superficially looked genuine. You all supported him/her. With hindsight, it can be seen that the edit(s) entered that DIREKTOR and I opposed/rejected/reverted were appallingly POV and supported by a desperate scratching around for internet sources that, when found, ranged from the neo-fascist (Sunić/IHR) to the vaguely circumstantial (Meares the translator). I, personally, have no doubt that Tito was no angel - he was a flawed human being, just as we all are - but I will not stand idly by while POV monsters attempt to abuse our Wikipedia to """"fight the good fight"""". That's why I was (unacceptably) angry a week ago, but I hope that the developments of the last week enable you all to see what we face here. I, speaking only for myself, think that the Tito article in question dwells way too much on the WWII period, with not enough on the major period that should be covered, namely his time as head of state.

If you look at my changes today, I included only the birth dates of the two children who are now adults (one of whom has a Wikipedia article already) with three independent sources for Track’s birth date of 20 April 1989, and I included the birth date for baby Trig, since he was SO MUCH in the news last year. I was trying to find a compromise position. There is no consensus here for including or for excluding, and, if you read previous talk pages, you will see no consensus there either.

In the spirit of erring on the side of more information (Wikipedia’s mission is to inform, after all), I made today’s revision. The immediate reversion, wiping out all birth dates, except that of little Tripp Johnston (certainly the most irrelevant birth date of all), is a bit risible and does not demonstrate any consensus either. As for the sources, I shall find better ones, but that argument is a red herring. No one has found any other birth date for Track other than 20 April 1989. All the sources (weaker or stronger) agree on the birth date.

I have read WP:UNDUE. It supports including neutral factual information. Birth dates fall into that category. I really don’t see where the problem is here. I shall not continue to include the birth dates in the article, but this demonstrates that Wiki-articles need more consistent management.

Think of a discipline who straddles the fence between the fields of EE and CS (then slips off both ;-)). That's where CpE would unfortunately  land.

Libelous Content Warning
Errors in reposting of old entry:

I reverted this entry back to the content I posted back in November (making certain modifications since Mills is no longer Insurance Superintendent) because of the following errors and libelous content:

1.  Old entry starts that Mills was from Middletown, but he was originally from the Town of Wallkill.

2.  The police department entry was not cited, and I happen to know that the content listed here happened after Mills had left the Town Supervisor post.

3.  Information about his decision to run for office again is not cited, and the quote """"many political observers believe his ethical lapses will be too great a hurdle to overcome in any future bid for elective office"""" is not cited and has no basis in fact.

I implore users not to make any other changes which are libelous and error ridden.  Thank you!

Tioga County Results
Howard Mills did not win Tioga county.  On election night it first appeared as though he did.  However when the Board of Elections counted the absentee and affidavit ballots he lost.

Howard Mills received 9,602 votes on the Republican Party line.

Charles Schumer received 9,790 votes on the Democratic Party line, plus 647 votes on the Independence Party line and 435 votes on the Working Families Line for a total of 10,872 votes to Howard Mills 9,602.

 Your sig... 

I'm curious as to how you're signing off. Are you doing ~~~~, or are you typing it by hand? Your signature should always be linked to your user page, talk page, or both, just as a heads up. 

Also, whilst it's always great to have new vandal fighters, you've been one of the very rare people who go straight into full on vandalfighting straight from creating an account. It's something that we don't tend to recommend because a lot of the tools are really easy to go wrong on. I know when I first used Twinkle I somehow managed to screw that up as well. 

But besides that, I'm sure having one more vandal fighter, regardless how new, is never a bad thing for Wikipedia, right? So my suggestion to you would be to get adopted by a more experienced user. (I'm still learning the ropes myself, and being adopted has been immensely helpful, if only to know that there's people I can go to for help.) Wikipedia is a really hard community to become part of sometimes, and I'm afraid you've been one of those who's had a bit of a rough time getting settled. I hope it does get better for you- and I think getting mentored by someone will help you greatly with that.

"""POV ==

The comments at the end of the article violate the Wikipedia policies on NPOV and verifiability.  In particular:

""""But the party never succeeded in persuading many people that Communism was the answer to these problems."""" -
This statement implies that the CPA was trying to persuade people that Communism was the answer to issues of civil rights, etc.  I doubt that this is the case, and it is not supported by any source that I know of.

""""Against these achievements must be set the party's long history as an apologist for the Soviet Union."""" -
The word """"apologist"""" is highly pejorative, and has no place in an encyclopedia article.  For example, the article on the Liberal Party does not describe them as an apologist for the United States.  In addition, the CPA appears to have been critical of the Soviet Union starting in 1968 (23 years before its dissolution).  It would be reasonable to state that the CPA long supported the Soviet Union, but this would be misleading without mentioning that the party was later critical of the Soviet Union.

""""Disenchantment with the Soviet Union led most of the party's members to leave over time."""" -
There were many factors leading to declining membership, and some people even left due to the CPA's criticism of the Soviet Union.  Although it is likely that disenchantment with the Soviet Union was the primary cause, this statement should be more specific and supported by a source.

Giving positive and negative POV is different to NPOV.  The article should present facts without passing moral judgement.  On its own, listing the issues that the CPA campaigned on is not POV, because it does not pass moral judgement on whether these were good or bad (although the wording does tend to present these campaigns as positive).  However, using the wording """"Against these achievements must be set"""" turns the paragraph into an argument on the merits of the CPA, with the campaigns presented as something positive and support for the Soviet Union presented as something negative.
TABIf this material is included, it should be given in a separate paragraph and give a factual account of the CPA's history of support and criticism of the Soviet Union.

 your multiple editing practice 

Hi,

The following users have already mentioned this to you: , ,  and .
Your practice of multiple edits for simple changes is distracting to other user's editing of Wikipedia.
You have asked for explanations and have received them:
 It confuses users who are editing the page at the same time as you, as my confusion was when we edited Dayne Beams at the same time and you had only updated his game count and not the stats update time, and therefore I almost added an extra game to him.
 The number of edits a user has is almost meaningless. Nobody looks at this number, and a user's quality isn't judged by the number of edits, but rather by the quality of the edits.
 It floods the watchlist and the recent changes list and makes it harder to spot if other users have made inappropriate edits.
 (adding this one now) Micro-editing takes more time, which you could use for other things, such as bettering a larger number of articles.

We would all very much appreciate if you desist from this practice.

Thanks,

  

 I fully support all four comments. Cheers,   

 Following up from your answer on my talk page, Yes we would like you to do the whole stats change in one edit. In one edit change from """"Player with X goals in Y games as of round Z"""" to """"Player with X+1 goals in Y+1 games as of round Z+1"""".

"Moving on from that, I too can see an issue with the age of Aldrasto's posts. As I stated previously, my speciality is Egypt, not Rome, but the same issue arises with Egyptian sources of the same era.  Basically, scholars from this period have great difficulty in perceiving, accommodating, or finding language with which to describe beliefs which are not found in Christianity.  Rather, scholars of the period -consciously or not - tend to describe by analogy with Christianity.  An absolute classic example is the translation of maa kherau as 'victorious''triumphant' or 'vindicated'. The words mean 'a true voice' and literally means that what one says will come about - but the underlying concept bears no relation whatsoever to the Christian concept of being saved from sin, having overcome Satan through faith in Christ. The Kemitic Egyptians had nothing that equates to the Christian belief in the need for salvation. The reason for the choice of words appears to be connected to Matthew 17, where Jesus drives out a demon that his disciples had been unable to exorcise, and tells them that with even a little faith they could command mountains to move about. A man who had passed the test of the judgement hall obtained power in Amentet, such that what he commanded to happen would happen, therefore according to the Christian model, this must be because he had in some way achieved the status of a Christian saint.",0.0

At night, transpiration usually does not occur because most plants have their stomata closed. When there is a high soil moisture level, water will enter plant roots, because the water potential of the roots is lower than in the soil solution. The water will accumulate in the plant creating a slight root pressure. The root pressure forces some water to exude through special leaf tip or edge structures, hydathodes, forming drops. Guttation is not to be confused with dew, which condenses from the atmosphere onto the plant surface.

(See Rushton & Jensen, 2005a, 2005b, Gottfredson, 2005, and Lynn & Vanhanen, 2002, for the view that the Black–White IQ difference is owing substantially to genetic differences between the races and that indirect evidence having to do with such factors as reaction time and brain size is probative. See Nisbett, 2005, 2009, for the view that the direct evidence indicates that thedifference between the races is entirely due to environmental factors and that the indirect evidence has little value.
Please stop lying. 211.119.109.57  

Then applying the same defintion to C the answer is no. Do you see the problem here? 211.119.109.57     
   
Question C2: Is the """"Hereditiarian"""" position a mainstream view?   
The question is whether it is a widely held mainstream view that the IQ test score gap is likely to be significantly explainable by genetic factors. Note that the question is not whether it is the only mainstream view, nor whether it has been proven to account for the entire gap, but only about whether it is considered a probable explanation by a wide selection of mainstream scholars.   

Yes. 211.119.109.57     
   
Question D2: Is Richard Nisbett considered a mainstream scientist?   
The question is whether Nisbett as a person and a scholar is generally considered to be within the mainstream of the field of Psychology. The question is not whether he is prominent and notable enough to be included, but about whether his views should be given equal weight to mainstream views within the article.   
   
No. Nisbett holds a minority view which has been described as having 'virtually no chance of being true' by a reliable tertiary source. 211.119.109.57  """,0.0

""""The idealized """"beloved"""" in the ghazal tradition is typically a woman, or God.""""
And then why is it believed to be homoerotic?????
""""The use of masculine grammatical structures suggests that many poems carry homoerotic undertones.""""
As I said it is the structure of the persian language which does not have any distinction between genders, which has made some so-called scholars (probably those with an agenda not related to mystic poetry) to makeing a deliberate mistake of talking about """"masculin grammatical structure"""" while it is neutral in persian. Neutral meaning precisely that if a man wrote it """"The idealized """"beloved"""" in the ghazal tradition is typically a woman, or God.""""
And the paragraph ends by ;
""""The ghazal rarely speaks about specific encounters; rather, it conceives of love as a metaphor for interactions among humans, God, and the world.""""
How about you, Haiduc,  going a little bit further in your analysis than just fulfilling your agenda (as I know your contribution in wikipedia very well) and looking for the word homoerotic?

"Kumar Rao the idiot fanatic
While you seem to act like the authority on the history. Can you explain why there is not much evidence in terms of ancient literature work in Telugu in Telugu script ???

Nannaya  has been considered as Adi Kavi 11th century(First Poet) in Telugu ?

It is not without a reason Telugu script has been linked to old-Kannada script. It has been well documented by many scholars and in many books. It is also widely accepted by Telugu ppl as well.

Read this  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nannayya....he knew Kannada and wrote in Telugu.

Don't talk about Kannada (as you have no fuck in knowledge about it).

Keep your fuck in shitty balls with yourself..don't try to spread it's smell outside.

Ask your CM (Rajashekar Reddy) who also knows kannada about krishnadevaraya's support for telugu despite being kannadiga. Ass hole kumar rao without Sri KrishnaDevaraya telugu would have been in doldrums as in the past. Andra Pradesh Doesn't have any credible institutes,colleges but only fake students,colleges like u fuck in idiot which in itself is a proof that you guys are big idiots.

Neither you nor I are experts in the article subject matter (least squares spectral analysis).

Dear Taraborn,

I am afraid you don't have a clear understanding of Wikipedia policies, for you are constantly violating them. You should know that here things don't work like you think. Here you can't just decide what's the correct content of an article and ignore any comment from other users, even when they are politely asking you to debate. You cannot reply these polite approaches with straight personal attacks, just as you have done with ,  and me. You cannot erase the discussions you don't like in talk pages, and you cannot constantly violate WP:3RR. This is the last one I am going to tolerate without reporting to administrators. Such kind of personal attacks are simply unacceptable. And, just for the record, have you bothered to take a look at my ? Yes, right?

Wow, people who think they own Wikipedia
Im talking about people that whenever someone makes an edit, they revert it to the prior version.  The sell out crowd picture I posted looked alot better than the cell phone image, yet the cell phone image was used. Why? I dont know.  Person who posted the image must be more popular than me I guess. 

You violated American copyright laws. If you really want us to use the image, then you cough up $200,000 to cover the fines from the lawsuit, and the legal costs. And yes, the person who took the cell phone picture is more popular than you.  The rid 
I think the crowd image is better, but Hyrbid is right. Free pictures are supposed to be used instead of fair use if there is a free pic, and we don have a free pic. I just wish it was from a digital camera and not a crappy cell phone pic.  

Why aren't the other images with copyright violations being removed? 

Because there's no freely-licensed substitute available. Speak 
Exactly. Those images do get replaced if/when a free use one is found.  

Thanks BMG and TJ Spyke.  You guys actually explained why the image wasn't used rather than threaten me with the legal implications I could have suffered.  I also wish it was a digital image.
No problem. If you want more info on WP's policies regarding pictures: WP:FU (the FU stands for """"Fair Use"""", not the slang term).  

And I wasn't threatening you. I was doing it to entertain someone else. Sorry if I offended you.  The rid

 Breaking News! 
Wikipedia should not offer first-hand news reports on breaking stories. Wikipedia is not a primary source. However, our sister project Wikinews does exactly that, and is intended to be a primary source. Wikipedia does have many encyclopedia articles on topics of historical significance that are currently in the news, and can be updated with recent verified information. (from WP:NOT)  

Results and 'breaking news' are two different things. 
Oh of course. Results = good. Blind speculation = bad. I think I was also trying to point out that as Wikipedia isn't a news site there was no need for a huge rush of people fighting to add information and make their mark on the article. It happened anyway ;^) Speak

 Changes between editions

""""Former Mormons, and now critics of the LDS church, Jerald and Sandra Tanner have claimed to have documented almost 4000 changes in the Book of Mormon.[37] The vast majority of these changes have been discussed in official Church publications ....""""

The part """"Former Mormons, and now critics of the LDS church,"""" was just added and it raises a question in my mind.

It seems from our article that """"official Church publications"""" and critics of the church AGREE that there have been numerous changes to the text of the Book of Mormon.  If so, the numerous changes seem to be a matter of fact, not a matter of controversy.

In this case, could the section be written in a more straightforward way?  In particular, starting the section with the views of two critics of the church seems to me to suggest that it is a matter of controversy.

"""

 I interpret it as that as we have sources that are conflicting on basic information. While each of the sources appears reliable enough none of them can be reliably, and verifiability, traced back to either reports written by the people involved with the operation or someone that interviewed them. There does seem to be wide agreement that OBL was hit twice with the first shot being somewhere in the chest/trunk (depending on the report), and the second in the head. There are conflicting reports on the number of shooters and the number of shots fired.

 We have a couple of options for the article. 1) Only report those items that seem to have wide agreement and to be silent on those details where our sources offer conflicting data. 2) Document the conflicting details along with the sources. I'd personally go with #1 as it'll be a cleaner article. We'd have a constant battle with people trying to inject a POV such as """"OBL was shot twice by one person - look at all these sources.""""

 I have a personal concern with the New Yorker version of the events in that it mentions the assault team blowing their way through doors and walls. For the first couple of days after the mission it appeared the public was allowed to wander around the compound and were only restricted from the innermost courtyard. Lots of people took photos. I never saw a photo of a hole blown into a wall nor did I see any apparent damage to the doors. Visible evidence of the assault would have been of great interest and no one took a photo? Thus, I'd say the New Yorker and other articles article is wrong on that detail. The assault team likely found the inner doors were unlocked and/or scaled the walls to get into the compound and to move between the walled off sections of the compound.

 There are other concerns about the New Yorker article in that it switches from great detail which appears to build credibility and the impression that this is an """"inside account"""" to an absence of information on basic things such as what team #1 was doing immediately after they landed. I suspect the entire thing was spun together out of speculative opinions by others. Unfortunately, many of the articles about this incident have similar issues. |talk """,0.0

"Ooooh, here's our Swiss neutralist! And what does this administrator bring to the table this time? Let's see, accusations of parroting, arbitrary classification of users based upon pen-name preferences, straw-men, ignoratio elenchi, and finally begging the question through the same fallacious reasoning as previously. We call that petitio principii, don't we? Apparently nothing will change his mind until I change my pen-name to something like John Doe. How does he know that I am not this Russian dude who likes Iranian history and culture? Oh, that's right, he doesn't. He probably didn't check my IP-address to see that I'm based in Sweden and could in fact be a Swede. Whoops... Sounds like our neutralist is using a subtle profiling method to his convenience.

Like I stated before, it doesn't matter if I'm a Nazi, Communist, Liberal or even a hippie. It doesn't matter if I do drugs, or if I look even remotely like a reptile. It doesn't matter if I'm even an obese Tongan kid. It has no bearing on content or the essentials of an argument, and anything else you might conjure to the favour of some imagined affiliation. This is aptly called speculation.

Now, I will only say two things. First one is a rehearsal of my previous suggestion: Livius.org is visited by thousands of people daily. Along with a number of other scholar-related websites, I can't live without checking it by a daily basis. It deserves a Wiki-article, where Jona Lendering is briefly described as the founder and maintainer of an outlet with roots as far back as -96. Yes, sounds like a plan of revenge. The paragon of Pan-Iranic resurgence! The removal of a Wiki-article of Lendering will remove the last great obstacle to a resurgent Achaemenid empire and the reawakening of the terrifying Persian horsemen of doom! Howl! Howl! Our world is forfeit!

Second point, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart: Get laid. Your superior-inferior complex isn't convincing anyone here, whether they be Iranian or not. There is no chance an article of this quality gets to stay. That's the bottom line, irrespective of any perceived reasoning. Either change the article so that it pertains to Livius.org, or stop your incessant whining. Maybe it never occurred to you that by simple observation Jona Lendering has written several Iran-friendly articles and has generally sought to dispel several popular misconceptions on the ancient Iranians. Maybe that's how you make more drama in your life, by arbitrary holier-than-thou attitude.

"Choose your Loyalties 

Sir,

It has come to my attention that despite taking advantage of our first-rate American education facilities, you insist upon identifying as a Bangladeshi.

My parents are/were Bangladeshis, and they were amongst the most wretched people I have ever had the misfortune of knowing; Indeed, during this unfortunate period of my life that I have been forced to spend in Bangladesh due to my father, I am now convinced that Bangladesh is the single most unworthy nation to exist. (I use are/were because, I regret to say, my mother was struck dead by Bangladesh - and despite her dysfunctional state and pathological lying, I mourn her loss greatly.)

Never have I felt more love for my country than now, when I find myself forced away from it! I have now given my loyalty, heart and soul, to the United States of America: The greatest country in the world, God bless every inch of it.

But after my experiences with Bangladeshis, I cannot allow for one such as yourself to leech off of the United States while offering nothing in return. I implore you to either renounce Bangladesh and enjoy the remainder of your life in the blessed free world, or get the fuck out of my country, you filthy ape.

Sincerely yours,

A proud AMERICAN",0.14285714285714285

 Theories in science fiction, Parallel universes resolution 

I think that the parallel universes resolution should not be put under the science fiction catagory. There are current physics theories that suggest, at least at a mathematical level, the possibility of parallel universes. One such theory is Stringtheory. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory

More accuretly it is M-theory.
""""M-theory
A multiverse of a somewhat different kind has been envisaged within the 11-dimensional extension of string theory known as M-theory. In M-theory our universe and others are created by collisions between membranes in an 11-dimensional space. Unlike the universes in the """"quantum multiverse"""", these universes can have completely different laws of physics—anything may be possible.""""

 The executive branch shall construe Title X in Division A of the Act, relating to detainees, in a manner consistent with the constitutional authority of the President to supervise the unitary executive branch and as Commander in Chief and consistent with the constitutional limitations on the judicial power, which will assist in achieving the shared objective of the Congress and the President, evidenced in Title X, of protecting the American people from further terrorist attacks. Further, in light of the principles enunciated by the Supreme Court of the United States in 2001 in Alexander v. Sandoval, and noting that the text and structure of Title X do not create a private right of action to enforce Title X, the executive branch shall construe Title X not to create a private right of action. Finally, given the decision of the Congress reflected in subsections 1005(e) and 1005(h) that the amendments made to section 2241 of title 28, United States Code, shall apply to past, present, and future actions, including applications for writs of habeas corpus, described in that section, and noting that section 1005 does not confer any constitutional right upon an alien detained abroad as an enemy combatant, the executive branch shall construe section 1005 to preclude the Federal courts from exercising subject matter jurisdiction over any existing or future action, including applications for writs of habeas corpus, described in section 1005.

"Lugnuts is merely stating this can be done, even, if you like, can be gotten away with. I think 1ragincajun's question was more concerned than just wondering about what is possible or not. In Wikipedia film articles I've come across ridiculous, tiny detail by detail plot synopses from beginning right through to the very end. And, yes, that's 'allowable', but can be very annoying to many. The problem further is that then there may be no real in depth discussion of the film beyond giving the structure of the plot away, leaving a shallow, spoiling article.

So I was a bit relieved to find the current Norwegian Wood synopsis.  It doesn't seem to have been suggested much, though ideal would be for films to have a separate full plot Wikipedia page, containing the full synopses first also. It would leave it possible for people who haven't seen a film to read the main film article page without having to learn of what happens through to the end.

Anyway, ideally, I agree with 1ragincajun. Isn't it possible to be a bit more vague about the development, including something like - 'the hero's life develops with these 2 love interests in an emotionally tight film involving tragedy'? Just a thought.",0.0

Plagiarism is not copyright infringement. While both terms may apply to a particular act, they are different transgressions. Copyright infringement is a violation of the rights of a copyright holder, when material protected by copyright is used without consent.

 Rayleigh scattering 

There is a """"citation needed"""" at the claim that Rayleigh scattering can be seen. I just did some research on Rayleigh scattering in air; I added some content to Rayleigh scattering. The bottom line is that at atmospheric pressure, Rayleigh scattering at 532 nm is about 10^-5 per meter. A 1 mW green laser has a luminous power of 0.6 lumen, and hence rayleigh scattering is 6e-6 lumen per meter over a 2 mm beam (a 0.002 m2 surface). The beam will hence appear roughly as if it were illuminated at 6e-6/0.002 = 3 millilux, which is comparable to a moonless clear night sky. (I should actually correct the number to deal with the angular distribution). A dark-adapted eye should be able to see this, especially when you look along the beam, which multiplies the apparent brightness by 1/sin(theta) where theta=0 deg means you look paralell to the beam.

Oh well done. I'm such a bad boy for """"attacking"""" the """"1st Lord Baron Wikipedia"""". Jesus Christ. All I wanted to know was why the Trayvon Martin case is not on the front page, and now I know - the people making the decisions about such things are just talking utter crap, and people like you who are apparently so threatened by the prospect of the outside world finding this out, you're prepared to shut me up, forcibly (and more despicably, others then remove my comments as if they had never been made at all). Well done. Now the """"1st Lord Baron Wikipedia"""" can feel safe in the knowledge that he doesn't have to exlain why he thinks a 20,000 word article and a 15,000 word article on something that's being reported around the world, has """"negligible encyclopedic value"""". And now someone who calls himself a bucket thinks the Lord was simply exercising """"most right and proper good humor"""" in acting that way. And the person going around erasing all my comments to hide them from outsiders calls himself a """"Rambling Man"""". Very apt. This isn't an encyclopedia, it's a playground. It only remains to be seen what the name """"Bishonen"""" means, but I doubt it's anything remotely intellectual, probaby just a cartoon reference or something. You can block me for 48 hours, but on this evidence, Wikipedia is going to be a poor excuse of a website encyclopedia for life. On further investigation, the 1st Lord seems to have got me blocked by crying to admins, which seems apt, seeing as he's probably just a child himself. Presumably the use of the phrase """"Bishonen with her finger on the trigger"""" over there waa meant to be funny, but given the context of my complaint, it's just rather tragic. Still, back to the real world, where the Trayvon Martin case is actually real news, and the issues it involves are of encyclopedic value. I've found the articles myself without the help of the front page, but apparently anyone else looking for them can just go to hell (in a bucket?). All, you Lords, Hell Buckets and Rambling men get back to whatever the fuck it is you do around here, which is cleearly not creating a useful encyclopedia (at least you don't seem to be getting in the way of the people who actually managed to write the articles on the shooting and trial, so thank fuck for that).""",0.14285714285714285

 re: VfD bot assistant 
When you get to the actual closing process, I'm not sure I know what could be safely automated.  So many of the decisions require multiple steps.  But I may not be the right person to ask.  I tend to close only the oldest and therefore the most complex discussions.  I suspect that I see all the exceptions and lose sight of the commonalities among the majority of """"simple"""" decisions.  I'll give it some thought, though.  

Am I correct in assuming that the bot would have to be run for each individual discussion thread?  If so, what parameters would have to be fed in?  How complex would it be to initiate the bot?  Would it be a different bot for """"keep"""" decisions vs """"delete"""" decisions?

The essential steps for a """"keep"""" decision are:
 Close the discussion page ({{subst:vt}} and {{subst:vb}} - I suppose the top subst could be modified to allow for a parameter like {{subst:vt|reason}})
# Remove the VfD header from the page (which ''usually'' follows the naming convention of the VfD discussion page except for second nominations and related nominations discussed together
# Add a boilerplate comment to the article's Talk page with a link to the discussion.  I usually put the nomination date on the Talk page, but the closure date is probably close enough.

If the VfD discussion has the same name as the article, a simple """"keep"""" decision might be automatable with a single parameter.  """"Keep as merge"""", """"transwiki"""", etc. would still require extra steps.

The essential steps for a """"delete"""" decision are:
# Check the article's history to confirm that the deletion decision is in order
# Close the discussion page (as above but the reason is often much more detailed)
# Sometimes, check """"what links here"""" and move or delete all those links
# Delete the page

I'm not sure I see how to automate that process.  There are too many variables.  I'll keep chewing on it, though.  Thanks again.  ~~~~""",0.0

Pentecontagon, and so forth
Please read WP:DELETE. A no consensus result at AFD means only that there is no consensus to delete an article and its edit history altogether; anything else, including merging, is a normal editing decision. When, as here, that non-consensus is divided between those who would delete, and those who would merge and redirect, that's consensus that we don't need a separate article.  PMAnderson 
I'll probably submit it to deletion review later.  
Please let me know.  PMAnderson 

I still see an overwhelming majority at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Hectagon for delete, merge or redirect, which is consensus that Wikipedia does not need these as separate articles. Pilotguy is right that there is no consensus between these alternatives, but that's chiefly whether it's worth keeping the article histories. 

I do not see any suggestion of Mediation, but I would be willing to accept it; I would expect  the mediator to tell you the same thing.

These articles consisted of a dictionary definition of the alleged term as an n-sided polygon, and a diagram of a regular n-gon.
I have no objection to having the diagram of a 100-gon added to Polygon; I wouldn't do it myself because I don't think it adds anything to the article; it's barely distinguishable from a circle; but I won't contest it. 
I will object, remove, or mark as dubious any use I see of Hectagon. It's a non-word, use rarely and in error; it is used much more often as a misspelling of Hexagon or Heptagon.
One of the articles also had a sentence about Michelob using a 30-sided prism as a beer can. I doubt this will add anything to Polygon either; it belongs it Prism (geometry), but I",0.0

Say what?! Look mate, I'm disputing the article, not CheeseDreams. The article is an essay written from an assumption (and in fact pretty much stated as """"fact"""") that Jesus was the """"new sycretism"""". This is, to put it frankly, quite far from the truth and though the info should be stated that such and such stated such and such, there should not be an entire article, especially one like CheeseDreams created. Why do you think I'm not opposing that a merge be done? Sheesh. You'd think I'm trying to destroy CheeseDreams life works or something. -  15:47, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)

I would NPOV the article if I could. I can't. Why? Because the material isn't reference properly. Incidently, don't hold your breath for CheeseDreams to come back. She posted her password to a known trolls page and forced another admin to log in to her account quickly and change the password. She no longer has access to her account! In fact, we found 5 verified sock puppets of CheeseDreams (all with the same password) and she no longer has access to these accounts. You might want to note that I did start adding material: I have created an article The Two Babylons, which I encourage you to help me make more complete (I've only done the first two sections - and not even that). In the process I edited the article to clear up some misconceptions of CheeseDreams (like for instance she called Alexander Hislop a """"scholar"""", which he most certainly wasn't). 
However, I'm not sure how much time I have for you. I'm a little confused personally. The other day I was accused by a Stormfront member of being a traitor to the white race and/or a Jew, however today you tell me I'm a Nazi. Would you people please make up your minds?

And seems that instead of using the article's talk page to discuss things, he immediately ran here, working hard to make Sandstein declare it's all """"bickering"""" and set another of Varsovian's beloved interaction bans. Instead I think we are rapidly approaching the point where a topic ban for Varsovian from all Polish articles for 6 months is in order.  """,0.0

"Request to Unblock
I began writing the following statement (excepting its two postscripts) before I was blocked. I suspect that User: AuburnPilot had me blocked, in order to prevent me from complaining to administrators about his misconduct. Although I was directed to request an unblock of User: Physicq210, who had blocked me, requesting such of the latter would require that I censor myself, and write as though User: Physicq210 had acted in good faith, and was one of the good guys. That would be surreal, and would give User: Physicq210 a moral legitimacy belied by his actions. And so, the following request for unblocking is directed at any administrator BUT User: Physicq210, but since I’m not a devious sort, I have nothing against the latter reading this. Indeed, I want User: Physicq210 to read it. For if I can be banned from Wikipedia for standing up to censors, then it is vastly preferable to go down fighting, than to go down the long dark road of self-abnegation and self-censorship, including the use of bad English. After all, if I wanted to be a lackey, I could go to graduate school.

WIKI Administrators’ Notice Board Incidents
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents

User: AuburnPilot

A few days ago, User: AuburnPilot began stalking me, checking wherever I had made edits, and going to the articles in question and vandalizing them. He or she has been manipulating Wikipedia rules as cover for what is clearly political censorship. User: AuburnPilot cannot even stand for Wikipedia readers to find out about factual material that upsets his political applecart through footnotes. Zero tolerance!

He claims of any source he politically dislikes, that it is either “spam” or a “blog” (or “POV,” another favorite dodge for those at Wikipedia seeking to censor those who fail to conform to their own POV), even though the one source is a previously published, classic magazine article otherwise unavailable on the Web (http://geocities.com/nstix/waronpolice.html), which the author has seen fit to publish on his Web site, and the other source is the longest, most thorough exposé yet published on the Duke rape hoax (http://vdare.com/stix/070113_duke.htm).

Note that I am not even talking about censoring writing within articles, since I hadn’t done any writing on the articles in question: Crystal Gail Mangum, Michael Nifong, 2006 Duke University lacrosse team scandal and Racial profiling.
I’ve been involved in edit wars before, though I have never been the aggressor, and have never initiated an elective edit war, though given the self-assurance that aggressors such as User: AuburnPilot exude, perhaps I ought to reconsider that position. It seems that aggressors rule here.

The reason I am making a formal complaint is that User: AuburnPilot has tonight upped the ante, threatening to have me banned
(http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:70.23.199.239&redirect;=no), if I do not surrender to his censorship. Should you find for me, please serve this individual with the wikiquivalent of a cease-and-desist order. Should you, however, find for the censor, please provide an Index of banned publications and a list of official wikicensors.

P.S. January 19, 2007 115A EST. Since beginning this complaint, I see that User: AuburnPilot has in fact succeeded at getting a crony, User: Physicq210, to block me, thus not only getting administrative support in censoring me, but preventing me from responding to his thuggery. (And no, I am not going to use cutesy, euphemistic language. If I were into such deception, I would have become a liar, er, lawyer, and would be worthless as an encyclopedist.) And I was unable to e-mail User: Physicq210 because I am not logged in and “You must be logged in and have a valid authenticated e-mail address in your preferences to send e-mail to other users.” (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Emailuser/Physicq210)

If this isn’t cyber-Stalinism, I don’t know what is! So, let me get this straight. Stalking and censoring an editor while using the equivalent of smiley faces (User: AuburnPilot’s penchant for saying “Thank you” after vandalizing one’s links) is “civil,” but complaining about such abuse counts as “spam, disruption, incivility, and personal attacks.” If that is verily so, then 2 + 2 = 5.

P.P.S The message here says that I was “temporarily blocked from editing Wikipedia as a result of your disruptive edits.” What the heck is that supposed to mean? For restoring footnotes and links that User: AuburnPilot had vandalized? If that constitutes “disruptive edits,” then you’ve utterly given up on honest English and all human decency.

Mmmm, this is a tricky issue. The debate as I see it is between providing a useful article for readers desiring information not otherwise contained in Wikipedia, and providing something basically inaccurate. For example, Brooklyn Beckham (the son of footballer David Beckham) was deemed not notable enough to merit his own Wikipedia article. Hence the link from Brooklyn Beckham redirects to the """"Personal life"""" section of his dad's article. Not strictly accurate, but probably the most useful link for people who want to know about Brooklyn. In the absence of an article about Gadara (Umm Qais), if there was no other article related to Gadara, the same might apply to the redirect to Legion (demon). The alternative would be to create a stub article which basically has just one or two lines of text, including a link tothe Legion (demon). This would give people the option of expanding it later on if they so desired. thanks  —   """,0.0

You know that the name change is not at all the whole point here. The problems here such as heavily relying on Chinese sources, inaccuracy in historical facts, copying government propaganda, are commonplace not only in this particular article but most all topics on nations colonized under China. And further, if the current situation continues on Wikipedia, you cannot guarentee the so called NPOV. Not only that will be a joke, the whole Wikipedia thing will end up being another hypocratic, """"civilization"""" game. The biggest issue here is the mentality behind the creation of these articles and problems here, hence the debate and this is just the beginning. You have to realize that the overwhelming articles on China-occupied regions on Wikipedia are full of POV but not NPOV. So don't keep fulling yourselves. It's time to wake up now.

Those who're currently in advantageous positions here, are so not because they're intelectually and morally strong but just because their numbers are bigger. They are basically consisted of two types: One types are those Chinese who're either been brainwashed and/or are chauvinistic fanatics. And the other types are Americans who (naturally) have so little knowledge about the world outside of northern America. But then they would have hard time admitting that and therefore, they will end up either pretending as they know or they would simply echo the Chinese POV which is largely circulated and readily available. For them, the famous saying, which goes like if you repeat a lie a thousand times it would become the truth, will make perfect sense. That """"truth"""", or what you guys are shouting here as """"the common"""" names and stuff, is exactly what is blocking not only your eyesights but as well your human consciousness.

One big difference between the two types though are that the Chinese here do know what they are doing because they have their agenda and they're intentional. But the Americans are just naive and are being used.

I am merely pointing out the error that so many, many people make. They hear that dogs decended from wolves, and they look around and see the only wolves left in the world in any number today are the wolves of northern lattitudes...they see the grey wolf of northern Eursaia and the timber wolf of North America, and believe that all dogs decended from them. Humans are a tropical creature that moved into the colder regions. Everywhere man goes, wolf populations dwindle, as anybody knows, and in ancient times, before man, there were wolves all over the world, adapted to their own climates. What part of this needs citation? Obviously, the first dogs to be bred were the ones where the people first lived, which is obviously the warmer climates, and it was THESE wolves that gave rise to most of our dog breeds, not the northern wolves. Now the wolves of the colder regions are the only ones left in number, the wolves in warmer places, where dogs were first bred, are almost all gone. Some northern breeds decended from northern wolves, yes. The spitz breeds and sled dogs, etc. This is all so obviuous, can you tell me what part of this you don't understand, and need citations about? I feel like I am talking to a child. If I tell my child that George Washington was the first president, to I have to give a citation? This stuff doesn't need citation.

You are a vandal, because you, as the only person on earth who doesn't agree with this, erased three whole paragraphs, not once but twice, on the grounds that there were no references, even though much larger tracts of the article are more controvertial and have no citations. You erased every word I wrote, even though all of it is true, none of it is controversial, and this is nothing but pure vandalism.

You need citation that dogs interbreed with coyotes? Why? How can you not already know that? How is this possible? And articles about the Russian jackal-dog hybrid are all over the web. Can you use a search engine? Look up the pre-caudal gland in any veterinary text. Things that are controvertial or new need citations to the new or controvertial sources, but when something become so widely-known that it can be found in every reference work out there, it no longer needs specific citation. For anything I wrote, you can look it up in Britannica. If you read something that you did not know, it doesn't mean the author needs to cite references for you, it just means you need to do your own homework. I am merely pointing out the things that are such a big part of common knowledge, and using them to prove that dogs did not all decend entirely from modern wolves of the colder climate where people didn't even live when dogs were first domesticated. In all my years of veterinary practice, I have probably told 100's of my patients that dogs decended from warm-climate wolves, NOT all of them come from the northern wolves. Now, after all these years, I am confronted by a web vandal who tells me I have to cite freaking references about this. It is purely annoying. 

If you erase my writings again I will report you as a vandal. Really, do NOT do it again.

the foundation of the issue is a fraud.  THIS IS NOT OPINION, IT IS FACT, IT
IS RELEVANT TO THE ARTICLE, IT IS FOUNDATIONAL TO THE ARTICLE.  I AM TALKING
ABOUT IMPROVING THE ARTICLE BY CLARIFYING THE FOUNDATION ACCORDING TO THE
RULES OF ENGLISH GRAMMAR AS ANY LITERATE PERSON CAN SEE.  AND I AM TALKING
ABOUT ADDING THE RELEVANT AND FOUNDATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL CLAUSE.

FROM TALK GUIDELINES (why don't you review them!):

 There is reasonable allowance for speculation, suggestion, and personal
knowledge on talk pages, with a view to prompting further investigation.

 make the extra effort so that other people understand you. Being
friendly is a great help.

 It is always a good idea to explain your views; it is less helpful for you to
voice an opinion on something and not explain why you hold it.

 Article talk pages should be used to discuss ways to improve an article;

 Deal with facts

 The talk page can be used to """"park"""" material removed from the article due to
verification or other concerns, while references are sought or concerns
discussed.

 The talk page is particularly useful to talk about edits.

 New proposals for the article can be put forward for discussion
by other editors if you wish.

 Do not threaten people: For example, ...
having them banned for disagreeing with you.

 removing others' comments is sometimes allowed.
But you should ... stop if there is any objection.

As I previously posted here: THE ARTICLE SHOULD BE IMPROVED by making it clear
in the opening statement that the entire issue is a fraud upon the public
since there is no """"natural born citizen"""" requirement that is applicable today.
That is fundamental to an informative relevant foundation to the article, not
a matter of opinion, and a matter of grammatical fact.

If I say """"No animal except a mouse, or a rat, at the time I give the signal,
shall be captured"""", then I am saying only mice and rats shall be captured AT
THE TIME I GIVE THE SIGNAL.  My order has no validity at any other point in
time.  Similarly, the requirement for """"natural born citizen"""" only applied AT
THE TIME OF THE ADOPTION OF THIS CONSTITUTION.  It does not apply today, and
the following clause should be part of the article, since it is the clause at
the foundation of the issue in the article:

No person except a natural born Citizen, or a
Citizen of the United States, at the time of the
Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible
to the Office of President; neither shall any
person be eligible to that Office who shall not
have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and
been fourteen Years a Resident within the United

Well, Alan, the article may be more about a type of smoking than a type of smoking reduction but the benefit of one-hitters to the latter issue remains important.
You have reduced the number of pictures to 3 this seems to me unbalanced in that Smoking pipe (tobacco) is allowed to run on for over 23,000 bytes (all drawn from only 3 notes, 3 references, 5 external links) with 11 pictures compared to One-hitter (smoking) with under 4000 bytes and 3 pictures.  Factbase: I should google this first, but I think I saw an article stating that only 1% of the tobacco smokers worldwide use a pipe (compared with 5% cigar and 94% cigarettes); if 1/10 as many persons used cannabis as tobacco and 10% of cannabis users used a one-hitter, on that basis alone besides there being ethnic one-hitters used for tobacco too the articles should have equal length.
I think the value of the article depends partly on some information (particularly history) which is conveniently presented in picture captions; so how about I look into using the """"gallery"""" approach which posts the pictures at the bottom of the article, smaller than the regular thumbnail kind but enlargeable.

 On recent edits regarding English section 

I have reverted some edits by Capnprep.  I'll address a few of his concerns:

1.  Do as aspectual auxiliary.  This is the only function of DO as an auxiliary verb and is its primary function within the language.  The non-durational aspects in English (everything not progressive/continuous aspects) are marked by the aspectual auxiliary DO followed by its subordinate in bare form.  English has two aspectual auxiliaries, DO & BE.

2.  Do is not a modal auxiliary.  It does not express emphasis / emphatic mood.  Rather, DO when used as an aspectual auxiliary may be emphasized just like any other word in a sentence.  There is no emphatic modal auxiliary in English.  English simply uses vocal stress (or in type, boldface or ALL CAPS) to emphasize the desired element.

3.  Perfection / perfecting auxiliary is valid.  Perfect is not an aspect but rather a verb in any aspect may be perfected.  Perfection is a grammatical category used to express completeness of a verb.

4. I have changed the repeated phrasing """"Most auxiliaries"""" / """"Most modals"""" to ...some... because this sort of generalisation is simply untrue and unfounded.  If anything, of the modal auxiliaries, those that subordinate to infinitive form are at best in approximately 50% distribution to those that do not.

5.  In the discussion of the various forms following make, I have once again removed the claim for passive voice.  That usage is not in passive voice at all as BE is not acting as a vocal auxiliary but rather BE+MADE is acting as a single unit forming a modal auxiliary.  Whereas MAKE as a modal auxiliary conveys internal force and subordinates to bare form, BE+MADE expresses external force and subordinates to infinitive form.

6.  Within the section on defective verbs I have eliminated some poor and misleading examples while rewording others.  That section comes close to conflating infintives with infinitive form and as worded was misleading.

Please do not revert any of these changes without first addressing and resolving these points here on the talk page.  """,0.0

 Your comment 

Your comment- Well, quite frankly, not everyone subscribes to that notion, and it is quite wrong of you and a handful of others to push your ideology onto people who hold a different opinion on the matter. There is simply no actual person named """"Chelsea Manning"""" here. What we have is a man named """"Bradley Manning"""" who wants to be called by this other name (and awhile ago it was reportedly """"Breanna"""") and referred to as """"she"""". That is all. That is the reality that the article should reflect, the policy of WP:COMMONNAME. Bradley Manning was a solider in the United States military. Bradley Manning was caught passing classified intel to unauthorized parties, convicted, and sentenced. After that, Bradley Manning decided to be called """"Chelsea"""". That is how the flow of the article should be, these are all things that a man named Bradley Manning did, you can't just flick a switch and rewrite history to say """"Chelsea Manning was convicted of violating the Espionage Act..."""" and so on. That just isn't historically accurate or truthful. When and if he legally changes his name, that is when the transition process of the article should begin. That all was simply way too soon.

"""Please read discussion comments about the expert article on the get conflict below. 

:For the religious process,  see Get (divorce document) 

A 'get or ghet is a Jewish bill of divorce which is supervised by a Beth Din which is a rabbinical court in the city or jurisdiction where one lives. This page deals with the Conflict of Laws or civil law implications vs Judaic Law (religious law) when a women does not get her ghet and is kept in """"agunah"""" which means chained.http://www.icar.org.il For a discussion of the purely religious implications, see religious divorce.

Discussion
Jewish communities have maintained a strong desire for religious, cultural and economic autonomy. Jewish Law is administered and enforced Judaic Lawin Israel and in the Diaspora through Bet Dins (Houses of Judges) Judaic Law holds that the man must initiate the request for the Jewish Divorce (""""get"""")and the woman must agree to receive the (""""get"""").

The relationship between state and religion

Jewish law or religious law is not justiciable in societies with the civil law doctrine of separation of Church and State which can sometimes cause conflict for women who remain in """"agunah"""". One of the most common divorce difficulties is that a spouse can be held in a limping marriage when the other spouse refuses co-operation in the religious form of divorce (see Agunah). A civil divorce can be obtained through local courts which entitles the parties to remarry civilly, but the capacity to remarry is also religious question. Where one party has the power to grant or withhold a religious divorce, this power can be used as a bargaining tool to pressure the other party to agree more or less favourable terms for residence and contact with children, and for maintenance and property settlements. Such provisions produce a conflict between the human rights of the woman to be free to marry and the freedom of people to practise their religion (see Article 18 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights which is repeated almost word for word in Article  9(1) European Convention on Human Rights, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief).  The difficulty is that most countries operate under constitutions based on a separation between church and state which forbid governments from interfering in the practice of religion within their territory unless the behaviour of one or more parties is in breach of the local civil or criminal law. Thus, for example, in Rhodesia, the case of Berkowitz v Berkowitz (1956) (3) SA 522 (SR), held that it was inappropriate to use contempt proceedings to force a husband to grant a get because anything concerned exclusively with religious formalities was outside the jurisdiction of the secular courts.

Nevertheless, the majority of Western states do, to some extent, make the secular court's response to matrimonial proceedings conditional on the relevant party taking the steps necessary to complete a religious divorce on fair terms, so that either the court will impose excessively generous orders for maintenance and property settlement, or deny access to a civil decree or to ancillary relief until the religious formalities have been completed. 

Canada

In Canada, following consultation with all major religious groups, the Divorce Act was amended in 1985 to add Section 21.1 to give the courts have the power to dismiss any application, and strike out any pleadings and affidavits filed by a spouse who has failed to remove religious barriers to the remarriage of the other spouse. The legislature intended to:
place spouses on a more equal footing in civil divorce actions;
encourage women in particular to exercise fully their rights under the law; and
maintain the integrity of the Divorce Act 1985 by helping to ensure that refusing to accept or to give a religious divorce was not used as a bargaining tool to gain unfair concessions on child custody and access, or monetary support. 
This reflects a general strong response at a federal level to any elements of duress or undue influence within the civil law system.

 You should wait for others to write an article about subjects in which you are personally involved. This applies to articles about you, your achievements, your band, your business, your publications, your website, your relatives, and any other possible conflict of interest. 

Creating an article about yourself is strongly discouraged. If you create such an article, it might be listed on articles for deletion. Deletion is not certain, but many feel strongly that you should not start articles about yourself. This is because independent creation encourages independent validation of both significance and verifiability. All edits to articles must conform to Wikipedia:No original research, Wikipedia:Neutral point of view, and Wikipedia:Verifiability. 

If you are not """"notable"""" under Wikipedia guidelines, creating an article about yourself may violate the policy that Wikipedia is not a personal webspace provider and would thus qualify for speedy deletion.  If your achievements, etc., are verifiable and genuinely notable, and thus suitable for inclusion in Wikipedia, someone else will probably create an article about you sooner or later.

Look here - the admin closed as not abusive enough - what is it I did?
1.This user undid my edit, with an edit summary 'no I don't think so' which seems to breach WP:ESDONTS namely don't 'Make snide comments' or 'Be aggressive' 2.I tried to discuss at User talk:Cassianto but the user was again rather condescending and seemed to be ganging up on me with other users he already knows 3.When discussion began on at Talk:Moors murders, I simply put 'I think it is notable enough for a single line' - however, Cassianto replied 'Then you need to look up the definition of """"notable"""", clearly.' (Ignoring WP:NNC) I believe this breaches WP:CIVIL - when I indicated the editor should read WP:CIVIL they replied 'I did once, and I vowed never to read it again' 4.It is breathtaking the way some editors feel policies don't apply to them. I was not rude to the editor, but I was treated in a condescending and arrogant manner over a very minor matter

The user then preceded to launch a very abusive and malicious attack on me. He linked my 710 contributions [166] and entirely falsely wrote 'Not so ridiculous when you look at his contributions which seem to be all geared around the May elections. This user seems to be on a campaign trial on behalf of UKIP'. This is called blatantly misleading other editors, surely in violation of policies such as WP:AGF, WP:BITE, WP:CIVIL and WP:NPA. I have nothing to do with UKIP. I am not a member of any political party. I am not enrolled to vote in the United Kingdom. So these are ludicrous allegations. I have created 21 pages, 16 non-related to the elections. Articles I have created such as Endorsements in the United Kingdom general election, 2015 are very important and been widely edited and viewed. I have also created articles such as United Kingdom general election, 2015 (Wales) in accordance with precedent. I have worked hard on the project for good and in good faith. Examples: List of European Union member states by GDP growth and Mr Galloway Goes to Washington. I have successfully nominated dozens of articles for speedy deletion. As a new editor, I am deeply upset by how hard it is to edit this site without abuse and being treated like a moron (WP:BITE). It certainly is not encouraging for those wanting to make a difference in good faith.
Nothing at WP:SPA points to me. 5.The editor has breached multiple policies.

Editor still going. He has written now 'What makes you think I give a fuck about your political leanings?' (despite questioning them) and removed the ANI notification remarking 'what a waste of time'. What is the point of WP:CIVIL, WP:AGF, WP:NPA, WP:BITE?

What did I say that was uncivil? Mellowed Fillmore said 'It is my view that AusLondonder is clearly not here to build an encyclopedia. He is likely to remain a problematic editor and I'm not sure that any more patience needs to be shown' - yet I have created 27 pages  including Endorsements in the United Kingdom general election, 2015 and List of European Union member states by GDP growth. How can they possibly say that with your agreement?

After edit conflict  including with myself. (D'oh.)
The way your reply is phrased leads me to wonder...  but never mind, this could end up as an infinite regression.  Shall we just say, the inferences you draw from my statement are not the ones I recognise as my intent, or as their actual implication, so you making a corresponding complaint seems somewhat ironic.  (You also don't address my question about notification at all.)
My statement was about a) JS's actual notability being predominantly in the area of Creationism, rather than chess (and certain versions of the article veering away from this reality); and b) the motivation of that editor (indeed, every editor, at least to that point) to be writing about him at all.  That's pretty clearly related to his significance as a creationist, and not some interest in writing about about chess more generally.  An implication of a """"pretext to promote a creationist agenda"""" does not appear to correlate with what I said at all.  (What I had in mind was more, increasing similarity to dust-jacket prose, and AA being reluctsnt to acknowledge this about his relative notabilities.)
Your """"false comparison"""" is likewise, nothing like any I was making.  JS is very notable as a Creationist, being a bucketload-selling author on such topics, as well as an internet celeb, which certainly merits an article, which in turn requires some discussion of his prowess  and distinctly lesser notability  as a chess player.  He's not so notable as a chess player that he would ordinarily have an article purely on him as such, and I see no reason to include every possible fact about him as a chess player, out of proportion to actual notability.
At any rate, if your evidence on the RFAr page stands as is, I shall feel compelled to respond to dispute your assertions about my comment.  I was rather hoping to keep out of the whole mess, personally, going as it largely does to """"does privacy policy completely trump autobiography concerns"""", about which I have opinions, but little direct involvement.

"Personal negative feelings mingled in this article 

Hi, while reading through this article accidentaly, I found several sentences to be out of tone. They seem to reflect personal negative experiences and they would probably be find a better place in a seperate paragraph (eg criticisms) instead of randomly inserted throughout the article. As I am not familiar with this topic or it's criticisms, so I choose not to edit this myself.

example  

NP was conceived by Mel Duncan and David Hartsough and other participants at the 1999 Hague Appeal for Peace and constituted in the 2002 Convening Event in Surajkund, India [1]. Hartsough allows his name to be used in fund raising efforts, but he would probably change his mind if he had the courage to investigate what the organization is really all about. It is a violent, phony organization that has never provided protection to anyone, and says whatever it needs to say to raise money. The goals and projects of the organisation have received endorsements from Nobel Laureates, peace activists, and communities of faith internationally. Following on Nonviolent Peaceforce's debut project in Sri Lanka, a second full deployment was launched on Mindanao island in the Philippines in April 2007.",0.0

Why is it kosher to count neutral votes as opposes? Perhaps I misunderstand the point of a neutral vote, but it seems to me you have chosen to count a nominally neutral voter's comments as a de facto oppose vote. Wouldn't those who voted neutral (i.e., no opinion one way or the other) have voted to oppose if that's what they'd intended? This strikes me as being tantamount to coöpting votes, and given that the difference between discarding the neutrals and counting them as opposes is the difference between 68% and 75% support, I would like to better understand this aspect of the consensus doctrine.

RE: MPT
Hi it has come to my attention that it is only the english articles that uses """"MRT"""" instead of """"MPT"""" which is used in the rest of other language wiki articles especially the Macedonian one. Debunking your romanized alphabet argument, it could be seen how even the logo has put """"MPT"""" in a romanized alphabet form therefore should be the one to be followed. It is practice here in wikipedia to use the official naming used by the one being described in the article no matter what their translation to english might be such as Volkswagen which in direct romanized translation is """"Folkswagen"""" but the former prevailed due to it being the one used in the official logo of the company albeit being romanized too. I understand your argument on the main article """"Macedonian Radio Television"""" that is why I kept that because its original name would not make sense in an expanded form here in english wiki. But its acronym should not be meddled upon especially it has a logo to prove it and the main article could provide the knowledge why MPT and what is its translation to english.Lastly the MRT 1 and MRT 2 pages should be really up for a disambiguation as the MRT worldwide may refer to Mass Rapid Transit or an equivalent rail term.

"Controversies - Did he had conspired 9/11? 

I don't want to make Wikipedia offended (primarily the article), but I think it's strange that he had financed to implode the buildings on the World Trade Center. I don't think it would be relevant in the article by Wikipedia's standards or if I would receive a notification on disruption or something like that. Here I go. 

He is a Jewish person right? He wanted to implode the buildings for a war on Islam. Secondly, there was a television tower on top of the World Trade Center - does that seem weird to you people? That was all done for capitalism, propaganda, scare tactics, exploitation and viewers? No one talks about that. The television agencies wanted them to blame Islam for good measure, because of oil.  Oil, television agencies, government power, and lobbyist, in a government operated building. This man who had made up 9/11 is Jewish… It was all over religions… Jews versus Islams… Now governmental Jews are in power again only because of this incident …
Just months before 9/11, there was over $3.4 trillion dollars financed to the city, and they agreed to this situation; however, he had gained profit from the victims, which he's at $7 billion (USD). He had knew about the asbestos before he had bought the World Trade Center in 1980's. Plus the towers of 2, 3, 4, and 7 - were over $10 billion (USD - with tax).

This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable.

"""==Why I don't edit often anymore==

Back in the day I used to edit wikipedia on a fairly regular basis. One of the pages I edited was the eXile. One detractor of the eXile, Peter Ekman, was so pathologically obsessed with discrediting the periodical, that he would devote weeks at a time to blanking and otherwise vandalizing the eXile article while launching reckless accusations at everyone who """"defended"""" the eXile. Although many editors did our best to contain Mr. Ekman, eventually he wore me down. It just wasn't worth it spending my free time containing the vendetta of some aggrieved middle-aged jerk.

As a parting bow in my too-long Ekman drama, I wanted to post here a summary about Mr. Ekman's character and the original wiki text that prompted Mr. Ekman's crusade.

About Peter Ekman

Peter Ekman is the aforementioned hack journalist who crusaded against the eXile. But once upon a time Ekman actually had an impressive sounding job working as an editor for the Moscow Times and dispensing right-wing platitudes in the heart of the former communist empire. Moscow in the 90s was a place where failures didn't fail. And for a long time Ekman didn't fail, despite his total lack of social graces and limited intelligence. Eventually his columns attracted the ire of the fellow Moscow publication, the eXile.

Originally the eXile was planning only on criticizing Ekman's written work, but Ekman's response was righteous, menacing, and hinted at violence. So the eXile's added a personal detail: they included the account of a female employee who had been subjected to unwelcome sexual advances by Mr. Ekman. Mr. Ekman had groped the employee while inviting her to a weekend get-away while his Russian Bride was out of town. Ekman responded with the same witless ape-shit animosity that I have since personally witnessed many times on wikipedia. Ekman attempted to get the eXile banned from Johnson's Reading List by declaring the eXile was a fascist, neo-nazi periodical. Ekman's evidence for such nazi sympathies was a spoof fashion piece entitled """"The eXile's Third Reich Uniform of the Week,"""" in which a fictional gay fashion designer breathlessly reviewed the 1938 version of the Nazi Field Bishop uniform.

Eventually Ekman lost his position at the Moscow Times. Since then he's occasionally surfaced as a professor of finance at various 3rd rate universities and, of course, here on Wikipedia.

The following is an excerpt from the Wikipedia Article on the eXile that prompted Mr. Ekman's crusade:

Peter Ekman, Johnson's Russia List, and an Unsubtantiated Groping Allegation
In November 2000, in Issue #23 of The eXile, Matt Taibbi published a press review entitled Peter Ekman Groped Me.  The article ridiculed Ekman, then newly appointed editor of The Moscow Times, for his approach to the economic and political development of Russia.  Taibbi characterized this approach as high-handed, condescending, and arrogant, and went on to mock Ekman personally as a pompous hypocrite: """"Ekman has only one idea (""""Russia has a lot to learn from America""""), which he tries endlessly to sell and resell as a varied package of ribald wit and insight.""""  The article also ridiculed Ekman for describing himself as a """"financial educator,"""" and described him as having """"a head seemingly worn bald from improper use.""""  As a finishing touch, Taibbi recounted an as-yet unverified account of sexual advances made by Ekman to an eXile employee, made at late at night at the Garazh nightclub in Moscow during a visit from Ekman's mother-in-law.

Ekman responded by writing in to Johnson's Russia List to claim that """"the eXile is fascist and racist,""""  that """"every eXile issue contains unverifiable stories that smear someone's reputation,"""" that The eXile """"is associated with the fascist party of Eduard Limonov."""" The accusations of fascism were discounted by many in part because of the eXile's Jewish roots - Ames, along with the eXile's publisher, deputy editor and several contributors are all Jews - and because of the paper's satirical editorial bent. It remains unclear as to whether Ekman did in fact make advances toward an eXile employee, or who that employee may have been.

(Why hasn't he been similarly blocked for 3RR or is it just one rule for one and another for those with friends in Wikimadmin?
 I added a fully policy-correct entry only to have TheOldJacobite arbitrarily remove it - and HE HAS (according to his discipline record) done this before. I, on the other hand, was simply adding a notable entry in accordance with what was required ... And yes I did read the WP:SONGCOVER. However, TheOldJacobite seems to think he owns this page and did everything to feed me incorrect information about policy - I checked and confirmed that he was making up clauses of policy that simply did not exist - and then tried to have me blocked and the page locked, a decision which Mark Arsten did not uphold. I'd like this matter now referred to Mark and an impartial review of the edit made again, as it would seem that your own blocking of my account on this is very one-sided and is, in itself, an arbitrary decision that needs to be referred to a higher authority within the Foundation. David Biddulph's referral for blocking is highly skewed as it does not include the background reasons for me having to protect my edit from the continual vandalistic behaviour of TheOldJacobite or Sjo. He, not surprisingly, skews the request by only mentioning 3RR and not requesting an impartial review of the entire matter. If that had been done properly, as per Wiki edit-warring policy, then a sanction against both parties should have been enforced.
It is no wonder that new editors are leaving Wikipedia in droves when they are treated as inferior contributors and those editors who have a rather chequered past - TheOldJacobite's general behaviour is logged as public information - seems to be ignored as if their arbitrary an non-policy deletions are sacrosanct.
I wonder if we'll see the matter referred to Mark Arsten as requested, or whether the appeal process is simply ignored. As this is a formal appeal, I understand that I can request the matter to be reviewed by another admin who did effect the block. Therefore please ask Mark Arsten to review the entire matter. Thank you.
P.S. As the matter of taking on three editors, sometimes it takes people like me to stand up to gangs of bullies who are all simply taking personal actions against a newbie and wholly contradicting the very policies that they purport to uphold.

 EVHS 

Hi, 

I saw you've been editing the EVHS article.  I wanted to bring a few things to your attention.  The user evhs00 has basically been copying the Los Alamos High School article.  (see for yourself).  Problem is that he's copied a great deal of stuff that does not apply to EVHS.  For instance he makes a serious of false, baseless and dubious claims:

 EVHS was one of Newsweek's 2007 """"1,000 Best High Schools in America"""" (#598).  This was baselessly copied from the LAHS article and is just false when applied to EVHS: 

http://www.newsweek.com/id/39380/?sort=Rank&count;=1351&Search;=&start;=500&limit;=100&year;=2007&

 EVHS is """"mostly middle class"""".  A dubious claim considering espanola is one of the poorer cities in one of the poorest states and has 21% of its population living beneath the poverty level:

http://www.city-data.com/city/Espanola-New-Mexico.html

 Many other claims are suspect, uncited, and bear a clear similarity to claims on the LAHS article.   

Additionally, 

 The image of the sundevil mascot was taken from the Arizona State University article and is not fair use.

 The image of the basketball team was taken from the EVHS Athletics website and is not fair use. 

Basically there's no citations anywhere and the author's methodology is clearly one of blatant copying.  I really want to avoid an edit-war between rival high school articles so I'm not going to touch the EVHS article.  I'm actually really glad that somebody is working on the EVHS page.

Which of the places on the list are notable enough for separate articles (if they don't have one now)?  I've added links to articles where I could them.

A couple of points of interest that could be added are Genoa, Nebraska (settled by the Latter-day Saints as a supply point) and This Is The Place Heritage Park.  I'm sure other landmarks will be identified with additional research.
Which places could be reasonably combined in sections, like the eastern Wyoming sites? Some suggested sections:  Iowa (mostly covering the 1840s); the Missouri River area (Winter Quarters / Kanesville / Florence); Missouri River to Fort Laramie; For Laramie to Fort Bridger (with a focus on the handcart companies); and Fort Bridger to Salt Lake Valley.  The Iowa section could include a brief subsection on the route used by the handcart companies from Iowa City to Florence.
And how are we to deal with elapsed time, as early companies had different experiences than later companies?  One chunk for geography and another for linear time? I think the organization of the Mormon Trail article should focus on geography.  Content that is intrinsically chronological could be moved to the Mormon Pioneer article.

""":Yeah, there is an article about that in Wiki too:Pre-Greek substrate. The -ulis suffix however poses no problem to include it as an IE suffix, you will find such suffixes throughout IE and they are traced back to PIE (Latin -ula, Alb. -ullë, Greek -ule (kotyla), in Slavic there is proto-Slavic *sedulo, Germanic *sadulaz (>English saddle) etc. etc. In Greek -ulis does not appear to be that common, but -ule (arbule) is common enough. If someone were to collect all the -ulis examples in Greek, you probably won't find any indication of a pre-IE origin for it, and even a Thracian or Illyrian origin may not fit the data. It's probably native to Greek or some Greek dialects. In the case of bombylis and arbylis, bomb- here means """"bubble"""" or some such (Greek pomphos, """"bubble""""), and such forms are found in IE (French pompon of obscure origin) & non-IE I think, while arb- (meaning """"curved"""", """"arched""""?) may also be IE, I just haven't checked yet. Anyway these Greek suffixes don't prove that it is also a suffix in Bardylis, but that's more likely than a two-word compound.

You are writing too much and not directly responding to text written by others.

May I make a suggestion? Regular editors here see far too much irrelevant commentary, and their brains go into automatic after reading a couple of off-topic sentences. You are inadvertently obfuscating your point because you preface it with too much extraneous material. For a practical illustration of what I mean, I suggest that you should either comment here about my style (and if you like, request opinions at WP:WQA), or comment at Talk:Sentence spacing on a single point that relates to improving the article.

Daniel Vincent Kelley's Theory regarding this phrase
First I want to point out that while it is CLAIMED in the article that Marie Antoinette was kind and noble and gracious of the peasants, NOTHING is cited to prove such. The one Antoinette quote that is offered to this end, smacks of sociopathology or her recognition that she would promote her OWN cause, by offering kindness to those who are proving themselves kind to her. There's nothing in the phrase to indicate that she was speaking of the whole of the French people, but it seems she was speaking about some particular people who had been particularly kind to her. Calculating psychopaths can be kind for this reason, so that they will enjoy camaraderie with their aids. So, this statement, that she felt she should be nice to the people who were being nice to her, certainly does NOT certify Marie Antoinette as kind hearted or noble. I suspect, that much as the phrase is thrown around today, it was probably thrown around by the clique of it's originator. They probably had a real laugh, suggesting things the peasants could eat, when they ran out of bread as happened under the leadership of every dictatorial monarchy. Here's how I imagine the phrase came to be said by Marie Antoinette is she heard her royal family, her mom and dad and step parents, maybe her grandparents, talking about what had been said in an age past, when the peasants ran out of food and started eying the national leadership as cause. Then, when she found herself in the situation, she used what was in her circle a cliche, that was widely unknown to the rest of the world. She probably didn't think much of saying it, she probably thought it would be received by her audience as cute and figured it would never get around, never become more widely known that she said it AND probably she hadn't really considered how callous it is when people are starving, to make light of it. So, my guess, is that, EXACTLY as the phrase is thrown around today for it being so pithy and the situation so often endured, peasants starving, Marie-Thérèse originated it, the phrase circulated amongst Royalty for 100 years, probably spoken of at dinner parties how pithy was Marie-Thérèse, how callous and witty and devilishly fun (from the sadistic royal perspective). So Marie-Thérèse originates it, Marie Antoinette's family speaks of it, tells the story. Marie Antoinette happens upon the same situation, bread shortage, she rehashes the phrase originated by Marie-Thérèse. Rouseau writing of it, attributing it to a Princess who he had not heard first hand say it, proves that the phrase was circulating in royal and educated circles. He says some earlier royal said it, presumably she said it to other royals and presumably Rouseau similarly heard it spoken by royals. So, obviously, if Marie-Thérèse said it, 100 years before Rouseau wrote it, obviously the phrase was conveyed by some royal story teller, who probably blathered on and on about all the corruption and hi-jinks those callous witty royals do, for love of reliving the old times and as """"lessons"""" to the young royals on how to live. Marie Antoinette saying it, in royal company, would be like her saying, I'm on your side royal friends. It's basically a slightly witty way for Marie Antoinette to say she doesn't care how the peasants get through their hard times, how the royals deal with the peasants through those hard times, callous, is her intent and plan. It was a way of declaring her loyalty and making light of the situation. Many here have claimed that because Rouseau wrote it before Antoinette could possibly have said it, means that Antoinette never said it. That's OBVIOUSLY nonsense. She OBVIOUSLY didn't originate the phrase, credit Marie-Thérèse, but that wouldn't prevent her from spouting cliche as so many nim wits make habit.""",0.0

 You're a liar! You have been lying all along including today, and right here above! Gurubrahma, please see the following examples of lies from just today, and here I'll quote what I wrote to him earlier: 

 Kindly please stop lying if you wish me to stop pointing out your lies. It's very rude and disrespectful when I spend my time citing verifiable and reliable sources and you just lie outright, nevermind content, but even on just simply what's happening here, and here's an example of just how you just now did it before requesting that I stop calling you """"liars""""; from Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8, I quote your statement and my reply to it:

 QUOTED: """"I hope that now since all editors have reached a consensus on the article, and have tried to explain you in clearest possible words the difference between numeral symbols and numeral system, you would play a more constructive role. Thanks.   

 QUOTED: Why are you lying again here? yes, lying! As you had been doing for quite some time now and as I have pointed out. The dictionary defines a lie as """"1. A false statement deliberately presented as being true; a falsehood. 2. Something meant to deceive or give a wrong impression."""" First of all, """"all editors have reached a consensus on the article"""" is a demonstrable false statement that you should know is not true and that we're having this exchange here is evidence enough that it isn't, nevermind others. Second, here's your other BIG lie, you say others """"have tried to explain you in clearest possible words the difference between numeral symbols and numeral system"""", Oh really? why don't you tell everyone here that it is I who made the clearest distinction and as far as I remember and see on the page I was the first to make it between numeral symbols and numeral system, and you should know because you have been around. I clearly distinguished in my first post between the Arabic Numerals (1, 2, 3, 4...) and the Hindu-Arabic Numeral system in a paraphragh that begins with """"- For a start,"""" Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#RFC_2 and you should especially know, not just because youhave been around, but also because what you quoted above happens to be just the paragraph under it!  And again I made the distinction in """"the clearest possible words"""" when I proposed here, as my first(!) point in an suggested outline,  Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#Suggested_outline.2C_please_consider_and_discuss """"differentiate a specific numeral script (eg, Arabic Western, Arabic Eastern, Devanagari) from the numeral system (ie, Indian-Arabic, which includes many numerals scripts), the rest of the article should maintain this, it should also keep in mind what the readers may have searched for when looking up this article and cater for those needs (eg, is the reader looking up the Arabic Western numerals script or the Indian-Arabic Numeral system?)"""", and then again zocky, who prefers my version and is against yours, made the same disctinction Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#What_this_page_is_about.

"""confess (even though I agree with the author that abstance doesn't work) this article is very POV, toward a liberal side. 

It's not POV if it's true

Just because there is controversy over a subject does               I LIKE WAFFLES                    not mean that a NPOV gives equal weight to both sides. If all (or nearly all) studies on a subject support one POV (as is clearly the case with abstinence; see Sex Education) , then while we should note that there is a controversy there is no reason not to write the most objectively true statements we can about it.

To say abstinence doesn't work is POV. In fact, studies have suggested that abstinence education does work. Abstinence education, for example, has been successful in Uganda. The Family Research Council has a few studies on this issue. Sure, the FRC is a conservative think tank but that doesn't mean its findings don't have validity or merit.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 154.20.204.92   

 Law Section needs work 

The section on laws appears to be complete rubbish.  I've attempted to rewrite it to make sense and be somewhat meaningful but it needs references, timeframes etc.  Who says that laws like this only reduce teenage pregnancy by 0.92%?  When did Texas pass its law?  Is it still valid?  What does the Texan law state are the punishments for teen-teen sex?  Give a case history where the punishment was as unequal as this article says.  What has been the effect of this law?

The original section said something about many goverments, states etc trying to pass these laws but they got killed(?) because of something to do with age of concent laws and human rights.  Give specifics.  Cite a Country/other body (and date and preferably leader of government) which tried to pass these laws and what happened.  Where such laws have been repealed give good examples.

Personally I'm tempted to remove the whole Laws section pending something more meaningful being written.  I'd fix the section myself but I don't have any information on what laws have been passed in this regard.

 Abstinence section 

The absitnence section is still suffering badly from POV problems (both before and after an extensive editing in the last two days).  The discussion of the debate about education belongs in Sex education, particullarly as this is very US-centric at the moment and there is a section there for that (it may be broken out to it's own article as well).  I've tried to edit the article on the whole to improve POV, but some help is still greatly needed  

Added UK-specific details
I've added quite a lot of UK stuff to the article: perhaps someone from the US could add some more detail about contrasting US policies? I've tried not to touch the bits about the causes of TP, so I hope the new stuff's not too POV. I've also deleted some stuff about marriage - I couldn't see what it added.  I'm really up for doing some more work on this article, if someone wants to get in touch to discuss some of the issues.   

Under 19
It may seem illogical, but teenage pregnancy is only considered as such if the mother is aged 18 or under at the time of conception, hence """"under 19"""" not """"under 20"""" - government interventions in the UK and elsewhere take this age bracket as the location of the """"social problem"""" to which this article refers.  It's not a copy-editing mistake, so I've reverted the previous change.  I'm also interested in the comment that """"the term used to apply to girls under 13 becoming pregnant"""" - I've never heard it used in this way in the UK, could you enlighten me? Thanks.   

I wish it was 21. I don't think it's possible to be ready for parenthood nowadays at that age, espeically with the rising cost of living. I also think that technically nineTEEN is still a teenager. They are also young adults, but they are still a teen. Most 19 year olds probably won't consider themselves teenagers and THAT is ok, but they are technically still that..a teen.

Hi, another few points about the second subtitle: """"Would the preparations have been effective?"""".  I argue that this subtitle is too long. The subtitle """"Historical analysis"""" would be more concise. As well, professional historians do not usually devote time to """"counter factual"""" discussions, like """"Would the US forces in Hawaii been able to withstand an amphibious assault by Japanese forces in WW II"""", or """"If it had not been rainy in 1415, would the French knights have won at the Battle of Agincourt, rather than being trapped in the mud"""".  Historians don't spend time discussing these issues. In 1415, during the battle of Agincourt, it WAS muddy, and so the French knights DID get bogged down in the mud, and so that is the course of the battle. I would like to see a source indicating that reputable historians have discussed """"Would the preparations have been effective.""""

I would like to raise an issue regarding the 'Cambodia' page where you reverted an deletion I made. I don't know weither you thought my IP was a robot randomly deleting part of articles in wikipedia, I can assure you I'm not )

If you carefully look at what I deleted (and the reasons why I did it, see in the discussion page on the article), you will hopefuly understand my motives and remove once more what I considered a paragrap that goes against the neutral pov policy of wikipedia.

 This CWCC story should go in wikinews as far as I'm conserned, it's an on-going story.
 I'm living in Cambodia since 2 years and while I've heard more than once stories of perpetrators buying the families of the victims to drop the charges and make false testimonies, this on-going story does not represent the general picture in the case. Right now the paragraph offers only one very subjective point-of-view, is focussed only on one case rather than trying to be general (like the article 'Cambodia' should be), and relies on only 1 more or less reliable news source
 The 'Cambodia' entry should not be used to try to make a point and help a person getting out of jail in a corrupted country.

Please remove this badly written paragraph that goes against the ethic code of wikipedia. Thanks ( )",0.0

By definition a delete vote means there is no """"accurate and useful content"""" so if """"merge and redirect"""" means only merging the good content then a delete vote certainly should not count as being close to a delete vote. Fifth grade is also not a good example for this discussion.  If I had just considered the votes I would have redirected the article.  However, by the time the VfD vote had ended that article had greatly increased in size and accuracy making the early votes suspect.  Votes in the period after the improvement saw no consensus to redirect. -  21:13, Oct 21, 2004 (UTC)""",0.0

Thanks for the barnstar. I love trivia pages - they're fun. But sometimes they oversimplify things, so that's why I put the wikilinks in, so people can find more information on the topics. RinkWorks is a fun site for trivia and humour of that kind. I also have some trivia files I collected a few years ago - I'm not sure where I got most of it from and I'm not sure how accurate some of the files are (with the exception of scrabble trivia), but they're fun to read.

Not a problem, but since accounts on Wikipedia are free and simple to set up, it's easy to avoid this.  (2)  There was no edit summary.  When hunting vandalism, blank edit summaries are an indicator of vandalism.  It's always a good idea to add an edit summary to explain to other editors what you've edited and why you edited it.  (3)  Adding your perspective, or indeed any perspective without citation is generally frowned upon.  All 'facts' should be backed up by verifiable sources.  Hope this explains why I reverted your edit.  Feel free to get back to me on this, or any other matter.  Cheers, and happy Christmas!",0.0

FUTON indeed.  I deprodded it because the cited city document spells out a series of reasons to consider the street notable.

What if the beam started lower, if the beam, was closer the the S, would more mass go to the S, would there be a point, where it would not split anymore? How many people repeated this experiment?
Answer: In 1925 most people did not even believe there were electrons. There is no spin, no electrons. It is a radiation pressure. Seccond, there is no such thing as having an N one place and an S in anther place. they are apart of the same magnet. How the magnet is connected will affact the experiment, so it needs to be displayed how that is. It is possible the are from two different magnets, in which case there are also magnetic fields around the experiment.  Seccond in the regionN S, there is a tension, like a compressed spring. When the radiation leaves the mass, it is effected by the tension. This experiment proves electrons dont have a negative charge. They dont exist. Radiation, has a direct effect on magnetism, and this experiment, needs to be redone, and explored.",0.0

 Original Research/Other 

The article mentions some details about the combos, as well as character storylines.  Although these things do seem accurate, a lot of material seems to have been written by someone familiar with the game and doesn't cite the source.  Perhaps a simple sentence, like """"The arcade included the following descriptions"""" would be more precise.  Meltdown's name is probably able to be cited from a Nintendo Power.

Winning the game with Eyedol does have an ending storyline that clearly parodies Blanka from Street Fighter II.  Another note is that the SNES version had a different ending (saying something about Eyedol's bracelet) whereas the arcade version mentioned the club.

Some notable game play features: I think the sky stage is perhaps noteworthy, as it could lead to some very short games on the arcade (although the Tekken series was known to have even faster fights).  Also, in the arcade Eyedol had a notably easy infinite combo (when the opponent was at the edge of a stage), plus a much more difficult infinite combo (running back and forth), and the SNES version didn't have these things.

The comment above about tapping a low button might be referring to the easy repeatable combos in KI2, which would be another game.

KI1 and KI2 used the exact same motherboard (the model # / name / whatever was identical on both motherboards), and the software was different only by the chips installed in the motherboard and the hard drive.  (Surprising, perhaps, considering how different the games graphical feels look from each other.)  These games used the Ultra 64 hardware, which was the correct name for the hardware at the time of KI1's release.  Rare had said (in some unofficial strategy guide) that they had no concerns/reason-to-worry about KI Gold matching the performance of KI2, making some smart remark about those concerns only being needed when moving to a less powerful machine.  (KI Gold was initially also going to have more characters, but the memory limitations of the cartridge later proved to prevent this.)  Therefore, it's not out of line to think that the N64 is really significantly different than the Ultra 64, other than the lack of the hard drive.  Cruisin' USA is known to use some other motherboard, and reference the Ultra 64 just as an unrelated advertisement.

Bugs in the game could probably get their own section, including Orchid's attacking after turning into a frog, opponents shrinking with Thunder's combo, Riptor being unable to get a high hitting combo when the Ultra misses, and the fight being able to continue on after Orchid initiates her Ultra (if initiated after hitting the opponent into the air and then backflipping, and having the opponent hit her out of the Ultra).""",0.0

With all due respect, the criticism section as it stands is a total mess. Setting aside the fact that it reads as if the year is 2001, an inordinate amount of text is devoted to a recitation of the Bovard article, which is A) a clear partisan attack piece (it begins with a snide and largely irrelevant attack on then-president Clinton's character), B) a shoddy piece of opinion journalism overwrought with loaded assumptions (witness the dismissive tone about """"politically correct noncompetitive recreation""""), and C) dated. Did nobody else notice this thing is almost a decade old? Yet it is being used as the backbone for the longest subsection on an organization that is evolving, growing, and changing to this very day. Bovard *does* bring facts to the table but as it stands now they are sitting in a void of time and space. His article does not make it clear how statistically representative the examples of """"corruption"""" were to Americorps as it functioned circa 1993-1999, let alone Americorps as it functions today.

I am not an expert by any means on Wikipedia's guidelines, I have never added or edited an article and it would not be appropriate for me to start here. But given this article's immediate onslaught of criticism, I would have expected an ongoing narrative about whether any stuck (especially with the imminent arrival of a conservative presidency) and how (and why) Americorps changed throughout the Bush years, leading into its present growth. Instead what we are left with is the cluttered product of a single user's anti-government tirade. I am not against noting that libertarians have a death wish for Americorps, but take, for instance, the section about Bovard's """"unofficial source,"""" who dismisses the reading program. From the beginning it was a rather questionable inclusion, but it is flatly contradicted by the study cited thereafter. Again, I'm no Wikipedia expert, but it seems to me an empirical measurement of reality should trump the anonymously-sourced attack from a pundit with a clear agenda. Why, then, is this whole exchange even necessary?

Equally embarrassing is the sentence about GED students, who now apparently need to be stigmatized for no reason. The short """"Articles suggest..."""" paragraph is only a little less disastrous; it presupposes that helping people get welfare is a bad thing, a judgment call which I think ought to be left to the reader. And even setting all that aside, why, from a journalistic point of view, does the above paragraph re-introduce the Bovard article? It disrupts the readability of this page, making it all the clearer that the criticism section comes from someone who is more concerned with piling one slanted attack after another than with writing an informative, cogent article. Narrative context is jettisoned in yet another paragraph (""""There have been a number of criticisms..."""") which goes on to raise vague, weaselly arguments sourced by an article that returns a 404. The user above me has a raised a critique that I think is also fair about the last paragraph's apparent opposition to the concept of self-esteem.

If I could make a suggestion (and given my lack of Wiki experience I freely welcome its rejection) this whole section, as well as the one above it, needs to be wiped clean. There is nothing wrong with noting that Americorps had some issues in the '90s, so long as this article leaves one able to discern that we are no longer living in the '90s. As it stands, the specific citations strike me as largely irrelevant cases of excess scrutinizing. The $20k+ cost to the taxpayer per volunteer is a valuable piece of information and should not be omitted from this article. It should also not be mentioned without reference to the benefits that Americorps volunteers provide. Contrary to the what the criticism section implies, it does not seem likely that tens of thousands of volunteers per year are being paid only to paint murals and put on puppet shows. If this means that Wiki editors have to conduct more contemporary research (the last 3-4 years seeming most appropriate) in order to determine just what services Americorps volunteers provide and who they affect, so be it. No doubt it would be even more difficult to assess how Americorps changes the lives and attitudes of its volunteers (and perhaps I am biased supposing from the onset that it creates more generous public services) but this, too, would be a benefit. Cite the cost, describe the benefits as neutrally as possible, and let the reader determine for himself whether the end result is """"efficient."""" And move on. 173.52.83.2  M32""",0.0

 As I said above, Deep learning is the name of a class of algorithms. Feedforward neural nets, restricted Boltzmann machines, deep neural networks and deep belief networks are all mathematical models. How the models are trained, that is, how model parameters are chosen to optimize some loss function, is another topic entirely. People had looked at deep neural network architectures before deep learning techniques were developed, but it was the deep learning techniquesunsupervised pre-training, layer by layerthat made deep networks more practical at the time. With today's GPU based algorithms, the need for pre-training has lessened. The hype surrounding deep learning has muddied the concept to point that people like Michael Jordan claim it is just a synonym for neural network. But the backlash from current hype doesn't change the historical importance of deep learning algorithms in generating interest and good results in deep neural network models or representational learning.

Response
Elonka, I was expecting it to be self-evident that someone involved in a dispute over a particular policy should avoid editing the very policy on which they are to be measured.  As you, yourself, told Jehochman,  it is highly questionable' behavior to edit an article to which one has such a significant dispute resolution COI.  I'd say a key policy by which desysoppings are judged by adminship is a """"No Go"""" area for someone who just finished a recall process and has an RFAR pending for things related to adminship and recall.
 
In any event, I stand by my UNDO, your edit changed the order in such a way as to move the parts on removal for abuse and emphasis on community involvement to the bottom and the parts on uncontroversial desysopping to the top.  You should know that WP:RECALLME is at best an essay (even though it is not tagged) and WP:ADMIN is an official policy, usually we work by consensus with such things and discuss radical changes before doing them.

Periodic trends are those which repeat from period to period (e.g. noble gas behavior recurring). What this really means to talk about is """"horizontal trends"""" across the period. What the article means to say, I guess, is that horizontal trends are due to a quantum shell filling, and since 1s fills within 2 electrons, there's not much scope to look at 'trends'.

Thanks for getting back to me. I share your """"opinion that we should point out clearly and repeatedly that both Republicans and Democrats are clearly to the right of the demographic center,"""" and I agree it seems like a minority opinion in the mass media. But I still view it as a neutral opinion. With this view, the idea that """"the Democratic Party is almost evenly divided between left-of-center liberals and more centrist moderates"""" seems irrelevant in the lead of an American Left article. I thought that text written in the prefaces to the Encyclopedia of the American Left might hold sway over other editors by serving to dispel disagreements about the scope, lead, and the most important subdivisions of topic. That might be the case in German Wikipedia, and I think it's the case here in science and history articles, but, in politics, perhaps no academic authority can ever hold sway over editors here. This means that even the foundational defining terminology of US politics articles like this one with a potentially ambiguous scope might never be stable. But I respond easily to baiting, I bait other editors myself, I can be sarcastic, and I'm an infrequent (but confident) contributor. If the article is improving now, then it's probably best for someone like me to just shut up.

Hi, nice to meet you. I'm mostly into classical music, but I'll take a peek at Smashed Gladys on your account. I would suggest waiting until you've been here at least three months or so, usually people are hesitant to grant adminship to someone who hasn't been here that long.

I would definately second what  said below. I'm not saying you're a bad user, I've just not seen much of your work around. Who are you working with?  is not a registered user as of yet. I did look at your article you mentioned. If I remember correctly, it looked good, but as I said, I have no interest in rock/pop/jazz/etc., so didn't pay much attention. Joshua Bell, Itzhak Perlman, Julia Fischer, Midori Goto, and Sarah Chang are all young classical musicians, if you want a partial list of some. Ciao!Girl♪

Hi Pickelbarrel. Well, I'm a Wikipedia:Administrator, which means that, apart from the usual work of editing and writing articles I can do a few additional things associated with trying to keep the place running smoothly and cleaning up when it runs less smoothly. So I can (un)delete articles, (un)block account, (un)protect pages and edit protected pages within strict limits. That's all, though. Some people find these things useful, others are fine with never having those additional abilities and the responsibilities that come with them.

The actual process to becoming an admin is to make a Request for Adminship, in which the community will scrutinise your general conduct and work. Generally, the community does not grant adminship to users with less than 3 months of good contribution across a reasonably broad spectrum of activity. After all, if you're going to have the ability to help look after the place, you need to be well-familiar with how it normally looks and works. So you need to show that your responsible and trustworthy, civil when in conflict and that you have a good grasp of the various policies, guidelines and common practises. There's a lot of advice in WP:GRFA which you can look through. You can also read through the current nominations on WP:RFA and see the reasons people give for supporting and opposing requests.

You may find that your time on Wikipedia is entirely fulfilling without the additional admin tools — after all, you don't need any of them to actually write the encyclopedia. -talk

Alright, Ched; I can see you are a reasonable person, and I appreciate you taking the time to reply.  I admit that I have taken this too far.  Some of it is an attempt to flush people out and try to understand what is happening.  I have made dozens of edits to to wikipedia over the years (usually not logged in) and I do try to improve it.  It's a great resource; we all know that.  I've had a very small percentage of my edits reverted over the years and it never bothered me.  To give a little history: I read the article and towards the bottom it mentions (2 sources, btw) how 2 Indians were shot, killed, and eaten.  I thought to myself, """"wow, that's pretty surprising; I had always heard that no one was murdered and they just ate people who had died naturally.  I should probably try to emphasize this so other people see it too without having to read down 30 paragraphs.""""  It seems to me that there is quite a difference between eating someone who's already dead, and killing someone to eat them.  Call me crazy.  Anyway, first I added a subheading and also put a mention in the opening paragraph.  I acknowledge that adding it to the opening paragraph was probably overkill, but doesn't this incident at least deserve its own sub-heading?  I challenge you to find the mention of the killings in the current article.  It is very difficult to find without reading the entire article.  And how many times in modern history have people in the USA been killed so they could be eaten?  I suggest to you that this is a noteworthy and highly unusual event.  Anyway, I will stop now.

Hey Ndenison, you recently deleted external link added by me to Big Four auditors page. Indeed, I recently added such a link and it was deleted by OhNoitsJamie. However, in course of discussion Jamie recognized that this link could be added: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Ohnoitsjamie#Thanks_for_the_notice.21
So, could you please reverse the deletion back? Thanks. BIG4PAPA.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 77.123.240.181

 Thanks, Ndenison. I would also ask your advise. I strongly believe that ilovebig4.com should be also externally linked from 4 more pages - big four companies pages: Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, Ernst & Young, KPMG, PricewaterhouseCoopers. ilovebig4.com even as of now has dozens of news and other stuff related to each of these companies. I believe it will be useful for those people who try to find out more about these companies. So, here is the question. Do you think it will be appropriate to add such links? Thanks for the insight. BIG4PAPA.

I don't know as I am not familiar with those articles.  My only advice would be to go to the talk pages of those articles and ask that question.   Ndenison talk 

 Thanks, Ndenison!   

Rationale

My dear fellow - what is yours? 92.4.216.135  

I'll be completely honest with you.  Some of the stuff I see is pretty funny, and sometimes I chuckle.  However, I use Wikipedia quite often to research random subjects.  With that being said, I don't like to see stupid crap plastering an article.  If you want to vandalize something besides an article (i.e. user pages, talk pages, etc.), I really don't care as long as its not mine.  Other people might care but not me.  Just leave the articles alone, unless of course you're adding useful information.   Ndenison talk 

 Hair trigger revert? 

You reverted my changes to Game Artificial Intelligence in the cheating AI section. These changes focused the section on the importance of cheating to AI itself; the section as it stood got too distracted by the wider considerations of cheating, and by specific examples.

I understand that, as an anon, I get less consideration. But please actually compare before/after in context. Trimming can be constructive too.

PAUL TIBBIT IS A WEED-SMOKING BASTARD WHO COMPLETELY FUCKED UP SPONGEBOB!!!!

I hope he fucking dies!

I love Old SPongeBob. New SpongeBob. I don't blame SB. I blame FUCKING PAUL TIBBIT!!!!  SCREW YOU PAUL!!!!
Thanks to that man-hag SpongeBob is completely f++ked up. 

Now, all Nick Studios cares about is money! And i Mean ONLY MONEY!!! They can do an episode where SpongeBob fucking laughs like a fucking pedophile for 20 minutes straight and NOT CARE AT ALL!!! All these people give a tinker's damn about is money, ratings, and fucking fame and fortune. These guys are like celebrities in disgize! They try hard yet put so little effort into their shows JUST to make a quick damned buck! The new episodes drive me nuts! Like Paul Tibbit even HAS any!!!> If I ever meet Paul in real life I swear to neptune I will cut off his large, hairy ball sack tare out his skull and feast on his insides for Thanksgiving!!!!

Nick's people these days are obviously on tons of marijuana! These drunk dunces have no idea in hell what cartoon quality is ALL ABOUT! It would've been WAY better if they just slaughtered this crappy series after the movie!!!! Why watch this shit anymore when Paul Tibbit DESTROYED SPONGEBOB!!!!!! Little do I understand the appeal of the new SpongeBob. I can't believe Paul Tibbit can actually get away with screwing around with a phenominal TV show like he's on freaking cocaine or something! P. Tibbit should be on trial and should get the death penalty is he's considered guilty. Sure there may be some people out there who like the new SpongeBob, but anyone that does may never understand the meaning of good quality. In conclusion, FUCK YOU PAUL TIBBIT!!! FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU!!

Right. So we've dealt with the question of Qworty's slander. Let's move on. Here's why you should not be involved in this discussion, Qworty. You have demonstrated - not simply to me; not simply to Wikipedia; but to THE WORLD AT LARGE - that you are incapable of editing in good faith. When the mainstream media characterizes you - Qworty - as a ranting, slanderous, biased editor, then... well, we should take that seriously.  I do hope you've read the Salon article about you? If not, let me quote: your screed was interpreted (rightly) as """"an apoplectic defense by one Wikipedia editor of actions that other Wikipedia editors labeled 'revenge editing.' There’s a lot of anger here (not to mention an unhealthy fixation with excrement!). Call me persnickety, but reading Qworty’s comments did not give me the greatest faith in Wikipedia’s internal process for building an encyclopedia of human knowledge.""""

Those aren't my words, regarding you. They are Salon's. THEY have identified you as an apoplectic, vengeful disgrace, with an unhealthy scatological fixation. So, that's what we're dealing with here: you, Qworty, as the star of an article entitled """"Wikipedia's Shame.""""

Now, Wikipedia requires that we assume good faith in our fellow editors, which I do, until the most extreme (and frankly comical) evidence points out that we're dealing with someone like you. Since we know that you will do everything within your power to sabotage any entry remotely related to Filipacchi, it's a waste of time to discuss matters of policy with you.

Despite all of this, I've given her the benefit of the doubt. Now shall we get back to the tedious matter of editing this article?

 What more do you want of me? 

So here's the response you told me to post.

As far as it stands it what more do you want of me? I am here. I've been bullied. There is no other way I can describe it.

MuzeMike is now saying it's """"possible"""" I'm not FaheyUSMC? Welcome to sanity land. I'm NOT. I spent all day starting at 10am at my girlfriend's church festival. When I got home I saw that my talkpage was locked up, and I started doing looking and I see a load of stuff like this from Toddst1:
19:02, 24 September 2011 (diff | hist) N User:107.42.152.229 ‎ ()
19:00, 24 September 2011 (diff | hist) N User:173.7.104.225 ‎ ()

That means he's blaming me. I was busy at a church festival. My girlfriend is in one of the dance troupes. I was nowhere near my computer all day till I got home, saw all of this, and tried to contact you last night.

I think it's a frame up. I think it's exactly the same stuff as this (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Sockpuppet_investigations/FaheyUSMC/Archive) where even Elizium23 says """"I am fairly sure that FaheyUSMC is not the same person as the other ones"""", but Toddst1 and the rest didn't care despite all the evidence. At least MuzeMike is starting to see some freaking common sense here. As far as I'm concerned, if the the """"evidence"""" against me is that I made """"personal attacks"""" and """"edited the same topic"""", then my evidence against them is that they were doing their level best to be as rude and uncivil as possible to piss me off and that I was forcibly limited to only editing the one topic after their initial round of beyond-rude behavior.

How many times did I have to ask you to request that they return to the discussion when they were ignoring it? How many times did I come to you and ask why Toddst1 was allowed to make rude statements and personal attacks against me? Some of it's up there some of it was on IRC. If you want to blame me for finally giving up when NOBODY here makes Toddst1 and his friends stop behaving like a royal... oh no that's a """"personal attack""""... then what am I supposed to do, huh? Just continually eat any abuse he and his buddies want to dish out? He's been hunting and hounding me, being completely rude and uncivil, and from his first action doing everything he can to make me angry. That is a statement of fact, not a """"personal attack."""" I don't know what his beef is with me. I have a suspicion, but I guess stating my suspicion would be a """"personal attack"""" now wouldn't it? 

AS for this rude person DQ, Also his comments on IRC are just trolling because he's asking me about being paid to do this...he had his chance to request unblock civilly and WP != IRC, so if he's affected by my +g, that's not my issue esp. when my email is on my userpage & he has the unblock-en-l mailing list and even the BASC if he chooses so - WTF? I tried to contact you nicely for over half an hour. You were blatantly ignoring me. And WTF is the """"unblock-en-l mailing list"""" and the """"BASC""""? More to the point why should I let someone as rude as you, who I wouldn't trust to ask the time, anywhere NEAR knowing my email address?

Where we very often see big controversies, though, is with editors who are disruptive while trying to help. This is where we sometimes see a harmful side effect of our (generally quite useful) notion of assuming good faith. Many editors have focused so much on this that they have come to believe that good faith is all that is required to be a useful contributor. Sadly, this is not the case at all. Competence is required as well. 
Competence is required.  Yet, what can we do when we suspect that competence is lacking?  That entry does not provide any step by step process for allowing us to express our concerns regarding editors who are editing outside their areas of expertise.  So Wikipedia policy clearly states that competence is required...but it doesn't give us anything to do about it.  

When we suspect that an entry has a problem...what do we do about it?  Well...either we fix it or we tag the page so that other people can hopefully fix the problem.  Clearly I believe these two editors have a problem...but what could I do to fix it?  Obviously I spent a lot of time trying to encourage them to look at the reliable sources.  That didn't work...so all I could think to do was """"tag"""" them with an accurate label so that other editors might be alerted to the problem.  

Are there better ways of dealing with problems of incompetence?  There are always better ways to deal with problems.  But so far no other editors have brought any other ways to my attention.  Just because I've """"tagged"""" these two editors as having a problem...in no way, shape or form means that any other editors will do anything about it.  But that's on them.

Thiru Muruga Kirupanandha Variyar, popularly known and reverently called as Variyar Swamigal was born at KangeyaNallur, a small village on the bank of 'Palar' river. This village lies at a distance of 5 km between Vellore and Katpadi in Vellore District. This province is referred to as Thondai Nadu in Sangam literature.

The 25th August 1906 became auspicious day since it has the glory of being the birth date of our Swamigal. (According to Indian Astrology, it was Saturday 4.37 AM, Sukla Patcham, Sasti thithi, Swathi Nakshatram, Subranama Yogam, Gowlawa Karanam, Thula Rasi Kadaga Lagnam)

 
     Swamy's father Siva Thiru Mallaya Dasa Bhagavathar was well known for his discourses on ancient Purana & Ethics. He was a great scholar, his knowledge and wisdom in Purana, Ethics and literature were unlimited. Hence, he was conferred with the title """"Puranethikasa Paarangathar"""". He established 'Thirupugazh Sabhas' in each and every place to propagate """"Thirupugazh"""" , the songs which spell the glory of god Muruga.

  Madhu Shri Kanagavalli Ammaiyar, mother of our Swamigal was a noble, highly discipline calm, affectionate holy woman. She was always align with the thoughts of her husband. Her kindness and helping tendency towards mankind particularly towards poor was endless.     The parents of our Swamigal belongs to Veera Saiva Dynasty (Primarily followers of Lord Siva) got 11 children, the fourth child was our swamigal.

 TAB
     The Almighty now and then exposes his greatness for the well being of mankind makes saints to born in this world. In this chain of saints, our Swamigal known as Deiva Thiru Muruga Kirupanantha Variyar Swamigal came to this world at the beginning of 20th century.Life of Swamigal spread over the devotional activities, Religious rites, particularly Swamigal made Saint Arunagirinathar's 'Thiruppugazh' known to the entire world.

 
'Swamigal established Thiruvarul Dhavaneri Manram' with his own cost and appointed Preachers for propagating the religious and devotional rites and ideals.  Swamigal set himself as a legend for self discipline; above all his life made men to live as men.

Naturally one may not be talented in all subjects One may possess high knowledge in one matter but least about other.

One may be a good orator but not at all a good author.

One may be good writer but not a good orator. Some may possess in depth knowledge in Sangamliterature, but do not possess any knowledge or interest in literature pertaining to religion.  Even people who are well versed in religious literature may not do well in music.But our Swamigal had enormous and deep knowledge and practice of all these arts and literature. In short he conquered, devotion, discipline, extraordinary memory power, kindness and vast knowledge of texts.

 TAB
The grand mother of Swamigal lived in Kurnool. There was a great saint known as 'Gurubalam' who possessed many talents (Ashtama Siddies). Out of his power he could turn camphor cubes into golden cubes.One day that grand mother(mother of Swamigal's mother) took her son-in-law MallayaDasar (Swamigal's father) to the said saint Gurubalam to get a golden cube for the her son in law. Saint Gurubalam knew this matter through his spritual thought.He asked """"whether the golden cube which I give last  forever? """"Further he told """"A child is conceived and being grown in the stomach of your daughter Kanagavalli and by the child your entire home will be spread with golden cubes"""". According  to the saints words so born was our Variyar Swamigal.

 
Our Swamigal never stepped into any school. But his father Mallayadasar taught him education, Literature, grammer, music and instrumental music, particularly Veena, Swamigal started reading and learning texts at Third year of his age.Swamigal was capable of authoring Venbas (a sort of Tamil lyric) at his eighth year of age.  At his 12th year he memorized ten thousand poems and authored texts like 'Ashta Naga Bandham', 'Mayil','Vel', and 'Sivalinga Bandams' which were too hard and a challenge for even highly learned scholars.

According to the Veera Saiva customs Swamigal wore Sivalingam(Sivalinga Tharanam) at his fifth year in Pana Patrar Mutt in Thiruvannamalai. Swamigal received upadesam 'Satakkara Mantram' from his father and received upadesam 'Sutchuma Satakkara Mantram' from Thirupugazh Swamigal.Palani Easana Sivachariya Swamigal graced our Swamigal 'Nirvana Dhiksha' and named him as 'Vama Deva Sivam' (Dhikshanamam). Swamigal learnt 'Veena' from Bhramma Sri Then Madam Varadhachariyar.

 
In his early days Swamigal had Dharshan of 'Srimath Pamban Swamigal' . Later once swamigal received Sadakkara Upadesam from Pamban Swamigal in dream. Bhramma Sri Loganatha Iyyer known as Madurai Thirupugazh Swamigal established Thirupugazh Saba at Adi Street",0.0

There is a longer article at History of the University of California, Santa Barbara with more room for detail.

In this case, in the chordate article, I think you misunderstood the text a little. The tetra is actually a bonefish. What is unusual is that it has a largely transparent body, whence we can see the backbone inside the living animal. I do not think this is very common among bone fishes, at least not in adult ones. Am I wrong?

I can understand that this was possible to misunderstand, since image was so dark that you hardly saw the backbone, unless you enlarged it. Therefore, I changed the image to one which hopefully illustrates the idea better.

 vague point 
would it help to rephrase the first sentence thus?

Biography

Offenbach's father, Isaac Juda Eberst, born 26 October 1779 in Offenbach am Main, took the name Offenbach in 1808 when he was already in Deutz where he had moved in 1802.Yon, Jean-Claude. Jacques Offenbach. Editions Gallimard, Paris, 2000.

The alternative would appear to be a long explanation of the Napoleonic edict.

  
Thank you, that sounds good, although I would prefer a link to an explanatory article or some footnote, but maybe that's just me. One more thing: the italics around his father's name and the bolding of Offenbach ought to be dropped.    

 Play titles 
Confusingly, in 'other stage works', three of the play titles with a Wikipedia link are no longer spelled the same (case) as given in the articles about the plays...   
Can you clarify? There are no red links in that section. zach 
There aren't any red links because the three plays in question are piped links to their English titles. Cg2p0B0u8m's observation that the French titles in these articles uses different capitalisation is correct. We know that the most widely used style of French title capitalisation, which is a bit idosyncratic and not cosnsistently applied in French writing, is not used in the opera or classical music projects on Wikipedia where a strict but easily understood system is used. Other projects are not so strict; that's why those articles on the plays use a different spelling.    
Ah. Missed that. Shouldn't we be using the English titles? After all The Tales of Hoffmann appears just below. zach 
Wouldn't that make for an awkward list as we don't have English titles for all these plays?    
Perhaps, but then what is the least bad solution? My primary editing instinct tells me that consistency should come first — at least within the article. zach 
But at the cost of consistency within the paragraph. — (shrug) Whatever, no biggie. The list itself is a useful improvement to the article, in whichever language the titles are listed.    

Yes, it's not a major thing. From Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_(France_%26_French-related)#Works_of_art it seemed that only classical music and opera had opted out of l’Académie française / into 'Grove'; no problem.    
Also visual arts, but as we have often remarked, this is a classic 'no-win' situation. zach """,0.0

"Process question re arbitration remedies 

Pure curiosity only, so apologies in advance if I end up being one of a stream of people knocking at your door today, but I'm genuinely wondering. I noticed that the remedies in the date delinking case were updated based on the revisions that were passed recently. I'm just wondering if there's a usual way that the case page is updated for something like this? It appears that you overwrote the new remedies on top of the old ones, with the original date and vote totals remaining in place — as a result, without checking the history, it looks as though that were the original remedy. In a different remedy revised earlier, the new remedy was entered with the current date and vote total, and the original remedy was placed into a collapse box. It's probably as simple as different clerks, different approaches, but I guess I was a little surprised there's no defined process for something like this. Regards,",0.0

""":An """"in-print"""" (or rather """"in press"""") article is not a reliable source.  It has to be published and referenceable where others can get a hold of it.  The errors in the abstract of the online version shows that it is obviously a pre-publication version and can't count.  (By the way, not even the TOC for the April issue of CASWJ has been revealed, so we just have your word for it that it is appearing at all.)

The New Developments book is so new that no libraries yet have it, but a look at the TOC online, as well as the article title, it looks like it is a review article, not a report of original research.

So, if you are hanging your hat on this references, well, the best that can be said is that jury is still out and DDP is still not been subjected to the judgment of the scientific community.

We can revisit this when the CASJW article is actually published. Until then, we cannot say that DDP is evidence-based (much less, that is accepted by the scientific community).  Of course, you may have other """"evidence"""", but you have yet to cite any.

 Cedar Meadows 

A tag has been placed on Cedar Meadows requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

That scaling one has us shrinking instead of the universe expanding and then says the density remains the same - however they forget that what matters is what we see and the density has decreased from our point of view so it isn't the same through time. I sympathize that the idea of a big bang is difficult but the scaling paper does not get round it, at best it just gets the log of time so 0 becomes minus infinity at the cost of making a lot of other things much more complicated.

The source from February 17, before any of the high officials from the presidency and MFA made their statements, says:
As to the political aspect of Kosovo's looming independence, Bosnia-Herzegovina, according to some of the reactions of its officials so far, will try to keep a neutral position due to a complex domestic political scene and numerous unsolved political and economic issues in the country.
But the article says this (citing that source):
Apart from statements from the three presidents, """"Bosnia and Herzegovina [...] will try to keep a neutral position due to a complex domestic political scene and numerous unsolved political and economic issues in the country.""""

Henry has never been a fair footballer, the match has just brought to light the foul play he has ALWAYS used to get an upper hand (even the biased french and arsenal fans realise). Furthermore, the quote by Wenger that """"he is one of the fairest players I have managed"""" holds no weight since:

1) It is a biased view from a man who managed Henry for years.

2) It is a view from a man who has managed a great number of cheating players during many years at Arsenal so saying Henry is one of the fairest isn't saying much.

 You are now a Reviewer 

Hello. Your account has been granted the """"reviewer"""" userright, allowing you to review other users' edits on certain flagged pages. Pending changes, also known as flagged protection, is currently undergoing a two-month trial scheduled to end 15 August 2010.

Reviewers can review edits made by users who are not autoconfirmed to articles placed under pending changes. Pending changes is applied to only a small number of articles, similarly to how semi-protection is applied but in a more controlled way for the trial. The list of articles with pending changes awaiting review is located at Special:OldReviewedPages.

When reviewing, edits should be accepted if they are not obvious vandalism or BLP violations, and not clearly problematic in light of the reason given for protection (see Wikipedia:Reviewing process). More detailed documentation and guidelines can be found here.

The following comments have been deleted:

The band promotes Croatian patriotism and ultra-nationalism, and sings about topics such as the love for one's country, family and religion, but also about the hatred of Serbs and Croatian social democrats. Dealing with such topics has made the band controversial. Perković has been known to openly promote Ustaša ideology because he wears black clothes, salutes in the corresponding way and had often openly supported the Ustaše and the NDH in his statements to the media. 

Ultra-nationalism?Ultra-nationalism means that you want to destroy everything that is not of your nation.While patriotism means that you love your own nation,but you respect others.Where in his songs does he promote hate to other nations?And no mentioning songs created in time of war against the Serbs,because it was the time of war.And only mention songs written by him.Not what he is accused of performing.

 Hatred toward SDP?Where?Name source.He is right wing,that si widely known.Of course he disagrees with their politics and he considers their politics bad for Croatia,but hatred? Reliable source please.

Where does he promote openly Ustashe?Citation please.Because he wears black clothes?Are all rockers Ustashe?By this,rock 'n' roll is equal fascism.He is a rock singer,of course he wears black clothes.
Salute he uses is an old salute of Croatian nobles,that existed long before Ustashe.

Despite this, his statements confirming his support for the Ustaše actually outnumber his denouncements of this virtual NSDAP equivalent (he is noted to have publicly voiced his support for the NDH, in various degrees, to the media on at least twenty occasions). His credibility in these statements is diminished not only by this fact but also by the legal necessity to denounce any fascist movement in order to avoid further banning (or other legal action).

Again,I see that this is already discussed.Feral is not reliable,its a tabloid.Only reliable newspapers should be used.And these quotations in Feral,while they may be true,there are no links to check the meaning,because they may be taken out of contest,and they could have totally fifferent meaning ii their original contest.This is not reliable.

And one more question.A couple of months ago I translated two Perkovic's statements in Jutarnji list and Vecernji list.I've put relevant sources,links to that articles.And a picture was there also.Someone deleted all this without giving explanation on the discussion page.This is not what wikipedia is about.Any change must be explained.Shame on anyone who uses this kind of sneaky methods.",0.14285714285714285

Each in turn

Suggested: In physics, force is the perceptible cause of the acceleration of a mass (change in the rate or direction of its motion) and is experienced as a push or a pull. instead of In physics, force is what causes a mass to accelerate experienced as a push or a pull.
The addition of """"and"""" is good. However, a force need not be """"perceived"""" to exist. The definition of """"acceleration"""" is indeed confusing to the lay person, but I think that the wikilink on acceleration covers it. We need to be careful to not go overboard in description in the lead.
Provide definition: """"momentum (quantity of motion)""""
Hmm, this isn't exactly an accurate definition of momentum since momentum is, in fact, both mass and motion. Again, the wikilink I think should suffice, but maybe we can reword things without providing definitions to make it clearer. I want this to be intelligible, but I'm afraid that including these points might be confusing for many and an annoyance to even more.
Following the development of quantum mechanics, it is now understood that momentum is a fundamental property of particles and that, according to the standard model of particle physics, changes in momentum are the consequence of the net emission or absorption by particles of momentum-carrying gauge bosons. Effects which are at the macro level experienced as a """"force"""" are the consequence of the aggregate effect of these boson-mediated fundamental interactions. In modern physics, only four fundamental interactions are known; in order of decreasing strength, they are: strong, electromagnetic, weak, and gravitational.[1] High-energy particle physics observations in 1970s and 1980s confirmed that the weak and electromagnetic forces are expressions of a unified electroweak interaction. No gauge boson has yet been demonstrated for mediating the gravitational interaction and what is perceived as the """"force"""" of gravity is more accurately attributable to the the effect of distortions by massive bodies of the curvature of spacetime as explicated in Einstein's Theory of General Relativity.
There is a slight issue here with the sentence: """"Effects which are at the macro level experienced as a """"force"""" are the consequence of the aggregate effect of these boson-mediated fundamental interactions."""" This sentence misses the fact that forces also exist on the micro level. A single boson-mediated fundamental interaction often has a """"force"""" associated with it. For example, an electron accelerates because it emits a photon: this is due to the electromagnetic force acting on the electron. One micro-interaction: still a force since a mass accelerated.

PLease explain to me, sentence by sentence, why you have edited out the following addition:

The main impact zone of the crash was approximately 19 metres (57 feet) in width. No wreckage was found from the airliner within this impact zone or inside the building. The lawn immediately in front of the crash site was unmarked. Within the main impact zone was a hole that the object punched in the building, approximately 9 metres (27 feet) in width. The Pentagon is composed of five concentric rings. Only the outer three rings were penetrated. The upper floors of the first ring collapsed, but the structural integrity of the second and third rings remained. At the end of the third ring was a circular 'punch out' hole, again 9 metres (27 feet) in diameter. The wingspan of a Boeing 757 is 38 metres (114 feet). The vast majority of the mass of the aircraft remains unnaccounted for. For flight 77 to have caused the damage observed at the Pentagon, the wings would have had to have been broken off, pushed into the fuselage, after which the fueselage and wings would have had to have been compressed sufficiently to fit through the 9 metre hole. No physical mechanism by which this process could have occurred is known.

Flight 77 did not hit the pentagon. Its so obvious as to be comical. The capacity of human beings to believe what is demonstrably complete bullshit because they are afraid of going against the group consensus never ceases to amaze me. You are being lied to, day in, day out, by your media. Stop. Think. Please.

I've said it once and I'll say it again- it's people like you, with little to no creativity and a desk job from 9-5, that get your kicks out on start up wikipedians. Your power is falsified and if ever one day something happens to the infrastructure of the internet, you'd be shit out of luck like a milkman in the 1980's. Additionally, why don't I tag your username for a copyright infringement? If it's true that you're a fan of The Simpsons, then I may never watch the show again knowing someone of your character partakes in the humor of Homer's comedic stylings.

So as you probably read through this and decide you're going to delete everything I have just taken the time to write, I'd like to know a few things. 

1. Do you have one of those computer chairs that has a toilet built in? If you did, I would understand why you were upset and tagged the article for speedy deletion- you had diarrhea. Aint it just the worse?

2. Are you married or still living in your mother's basement? It was a little unprofessional for me to call you out for living in your mother's basement, because, hey, most wikipedians do anyways. However, the point is, if you spent as much time reading through the edits of wikipedia as you did chasing tail like a real man, I'm sure, in fact, 100% positive you would not have tagged Max Katsarelas' page for deletion. I think it's time you get some poon. You don't know what poon is?  Here you go, read about it.

3. Do you put your wikipedia skills on your resume? Just curious.

4. Do you have cyber with any of your fellow wikipedians? 

For the record, I will continue to post Max Katsarelas' page up because I have kept the copy I wrote and I want to prove to you and my fellow visitors of the page what little lives you wikipedians have.

 Stillman inference 

a paragraph in the article, citing pp 14-16 of Stillman's 1979 work, reads as follows:

According to Stillman, Muhammad chose Sa'd ibn Mua'dh so as not to pronounce the judgment himself and avoid being accused of double standards given the precedents he had set with the Banu Qaynuqa and the Banu Nadir. Furthermore, Stillman infers from Abu Lubaba's gesture that Muhammad had decided the fate of the Qurayza even before their surrender.

however, the only relevant discussion i found was this (p.15):

When all hope was gone they [i.e. Qurayza] sought to surrender on the same terms as had the Naḍīr. This time the Prophet intended to make an example of them. He still could not act with complete disregard of public opinion. The degree of the Qurayẓa's treason was by no means clear. Muhammad had previously spared the Banū Qaynuqā c at the request of their former allies the Khazraj. Many Awsites were now pleading that their former confederates be shown mercy. Always the master politician, Muhammad stepped aside and appointed Sa`d b. Mu`ādh to pass judgment upon them. Sa`d was a devout Muslim and a chieftain of the Aws, who was dying of wounds received during the siege against the Qurayza. Sa`d took the hint and condemned the adult males to death and the hapless women and children to slavery. Muhammad then declared that this was none other than Allah's decision. Actually, it is clear from the Muslim sources that the Qurayza's fate had been decided even before their surrender. One of Muhammad's emissaries, Abū Lubāba, who had advised the Qurayẓa to give up, had to perform penance for hinting to the Jews what their real fate would be.

Stillman doesn't state or imply that Muhammad deferred judgement to Sa'd in order to avoid accusations of double standards (especially when he openly endorsed the decision), so i believe this is original research. what seems more apparent is that, because of the Awsites protesting, it was Sa'd (Aws chieftain) who was chosen to pronounce the judgement, as they may have been more accepting of the decree if it came from their tribal leader.again, with the second sentence in the article, i do not see how the solitary sentence discussing Abu Lubaba substantiates what has been written, or where Stillman is making any """"infer[ences]"""" that Banu Qurayza's fate had already been decided by Muhammad before their surrender.  
This is clear from the last two sentences of the excerpt. The first sentence states the conclusion; the second contains the premise.  Or 
could you also address the first point?  
This is clear from the following setences:This time the Prophet intended to make an example of them. He still could not act with complete disregard of public opinion. The degree of the Qurayẓa's treason was by no means clear. Muhammad had previously spared the Banū Qaynuqā at the request of their former allies the Khazraj. Many Awsites were now pleading that their former confederates be shown mercy. Always the master politician, Muhammad stepped aside and appointed Sa`d b. Mu`ādh to pass judgment upon them. Sa`d was a devout Muslim and a chieftain of the Aws, who was dying of wounds received during the siege against the Qurayza. Sa`d took the hint and condemned the adult males to death and the hapless women and children to slavery.
 Or 
i have provided that extract above, and commented on it: Stillman doesn't state or imply that Muhammad deferred judgement to Sa'd in order to avoid accusations of double standards (especially when he openly endorsed the decision), so i believe this is original research. what seems more apparent is that, because of the Awsites protesting, it was Sa'd (Aws chieftain) who was chosen to pronounce the judgement, as they may have been more accepting of the decree if it came from their tribal leader.

You're not even Maltese, how do you expect to correctly edit a page about a person who's only notable in Malta? Sure, you can rely on articles you find online, but as you may have noticed, pretty much all the media is against Norman Lowell and his party, for obvious reasons. There's even a website dedicated to """"spreading the true agenda"""" or whatever  . But of course, everything you read is only partially factual and mostly biased... and rightfully so, but such information has no place on wikipedia. Perhaps you'd be interested in writing a """"criticism"""" section? That would make more sense.

On a side note, regarding the banning of Norman Lowell...it is well-known in Malta that Lowell was banned from the media, but unfortunately I could only find one source stating that. The person interviewed in the article is the editor of one of the most popular Maltese websites, www.maltafly.com, on which Lowell has been frequently made fun of.

The assertion that Holodomor is a term used exclusively by """"extremists"""" is just absurd given the academic use of the term in the world.

TFD, in my opinion, is just trying to ruffle feathers and vex users here, there is no way his claims can be taken seriously, he has no once backed up his ridiculous claims of extremism and that it is a fringe word in academics. You see Ukrainian historians and academics in the diaspora use it more than others not due to the fact Ukrainian historians do most of the research in this field, just as Jewish historians have dominated Holocaust historiography, Americans American historiography, etc. To write off respected historical literature as """"nationalism"""" or even worse """"extremism"""" serves as nothing more than provocation, not legitimate deliberation.

"""AIG Loan & IQ==
Should facts should be added about AIG loan in that, the preceding days before this loan was arranged, Timothy Geitner, president of NY Fed, had announced and published in NYC newspapers that he would not make this loan as AIG had been asking for a loan of 35 - 40 billion from the Fed Res for a week. And that public request resulted in the Timonthy Geitner refusal to loan AIG anything.

Then, Geitner, Paulson and Bernake were all 3 informed of the 100s of billions in mortgage insurance that AIG had issued and also the trillions in derivatives insurance that AIG had issued and informed of the further clear conclusions that 
...
without supporting the AIG loan and allowing AIG to fail, this massive amount of market related insurance would cause a global market collapse. This info did NOT come from AIG but from private party to these three, Paulson, Bernanke and Geitner who had no knowledge of AIG's importance to markets.

And today making that AIG loan is credited with saving the global markets from collapse. 

But that occurred as just explained and not from any knowledge of Bernanke, Paulson or Geitner but from advice of outside party that reversed the already refusal by the Fed to loan AIG anything as announced publicly by Gietner. (So that outside party is one who saved markets from collapse - NOT Geitner, Bernanke, Paulson)

This lack of market knowledge by all three , Paulson, Geitner, and Bernanke, is important to understand in understanding depth of market understanding in current proposals to allow US Treasury to dictate systemic risk decision, when no one at the US Treasury, other than saying those words , has shown any knowledge of markets to 
be able to determine what that is.

IQ & Markets
In the IQ discussion in the article it is touted that the Bernanke has a higher IQ and that qualified
him for his job.

Also it has been mentioned that he is an expert in Depression Era events.

Neither worked to have Bernanke ACT appropriately in this global crisis which HE / Bernanke CAUSED
via fighting the spike in oil and gold prices and his efforts directly caused THIS CRISIS.

SO THAT with Bernanke's Higher IQ  did not have him perceive what he was doing would cause a near global market meltdown and his studies of the depression era did not clue him in not to cause nearly a depression.

/s Too True IOQ IX 69.121.221.97 

Demonizing Wall Street for US Government Caused Crisis
In the bubble, all agree was caused by Greenspan, and in the huge push to give mortgages to those non qualified which all agree was caused by Fannie Mae , etc and by Congress, this directly lead to the subprime debacle and beginning of the global crisis -  NONE of which was caused by Wall Street.

Then in the fight by Bernanke to stop the projected inflation caused by oil & gold spikes, his actions massively slammed the overall economy which was perking along just fine even with the subprime debaclev which WAS a smaller part of the USA $ 15 trillion economy.

NEXT, massive jaw boning of the huge crisis was done by Paulson to get funds and that caused the coup de grace, the huge retrenchment of all spending by consumers....

ALL these events were NOT caused by Wall Street

Then Paulson, Bernanke and later hugely OBAMA and Congress, again and again bad mouthed again and again
Wall Street claiming that this whole series of events was caused by Wall Street when it was mainly caused by the US Governement and aided by consumer spending retrenchment but Congres and the pundits caused the US population to believe the lie it was Wall Street's fault due to GAMBLING.

ALL distortion 100 %.

Destruction of Capital Formation and Wall Street
One of the key features of Bernanke's job in oversight for the USA economy is in also protecting 
capital formation....

And the engine of economic growth in the USA for 300 years has been the USA efficient capital distribution
to new ventures, old ventures, etc and the recent sequence of bad mouthing by all concerned of Wall Street
publicly now and including esp the talking heads on CNN and esp CNBC has severely damaged that core 
of the reason for USA dominance and leadership for those 300 years.

Added to that huge destruction is the special refusal by ALL of the US Government to Identify and prosecute
the huge fraudulent short selling of ALL major wall Street firms and major USA banks which was fraudulent

 Parting thoughts on Jmh649 RFAR 
This is getting posted on every arb's talk page and I will courtesy notify Doc J. I am appalled at how low the standards of wiki admin behavior have sunk. We've seen admins lose their bit for nothing more than one wheel war and yet here we have multiple instances of involved protections, edit wars, hounding new users, involved blocks, etc, and absolutely nothing gets done about it. Why? So Doc J can """"adjust""""? What about all his victims? What do they get?diddly squat, just like in the real world. I actually truly hope Doc J can change, but that is not what wiki history teaches us. Wiki history teaches us he will lay low until the heat dies down then steadily go back to his old ways and he'll be back at RFAR within 6-30 months from now. Just like the arb case from my day when a drafting arb came within a hair of posting sanctions on Willbeback but didn't and what happened? Will kept going on in the same old fashion and two years and countless victims later, Will loses his bit and gets banned. And Doc J gets to use a secret mentor? He'd only not disclose that person if he felt the community would not accept the mentor, such as the mentor wasn't neutral or some such reason. By not taking this case and not issuing any guidelines or admonishments, especially with several extremely weak comments by the arbs (ie, how can some of you see nothing wrong in his behavior) all AC did here was send a clear signal to admins that there are no more admin standards of behavior and admins can do whatever they want and get away with it scott free. This juxtaposed with those who lost their bit for one wheel war also shows there is no consistency at all in AC's rulings on admins. At a minimum AC should have issued a statement on unacceptable behavior rather than turning a blind eye to the RFAR. This is an unacceptable precedent for which the community and AC will pay for many times over in the future. The UN can do a better job of fixing things than wiki and AC can, and that's really sad. This is a classic case of how those committing harmful acts rationalize their behavior and others rationalize excuses on their behalf. See you at """"RFAR/Jmh649 2"""". talk """,0.0

Thanks, Trusilver. I will give it some thought. I learned a lot from my self-nom effort, responding as I was to some Signpost announcements about the need for more admins. If I did it again per your nom, I'd articulate better that my main interest is keeping the walls and floors around here free of extraneous stuff. I've ended up doing more vandal patrolling than anything over the years, though I like creating the (very) occasional article, uploading photo files to illustrate articles that need them and making small improvements where I see the need. I've been a sysop elsewhere and elsewhen, so it's not something I see as some kind of crown, but really as an appointment as janitor. I like leaving the place clean without a trace of my own effort. Besides, what I really have to think about is whether I'd be a part of any club that would accept me as a member, to paraphrase Mr. Marx. I'll get back to you when I've had a think.  Who, me?

Are you people for real?  Comparing Reggie Jackson to Wade Boggs?  Reggie played 5 great years for the New York Yankees, Boggs played 2 not so great years with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays when he was way past his prime.  The only reason that Wade Boggs wanted to wear the Devil Ray hat when he was inducted was that the Devil Rays offered him money if he agreeded to wear the hat.  If Wade wanted to waer a Yankees hat, the hall wouldnt have said anything because Wade played great for the Yanks and won a world series with them.  The point is Reggie Jackson did great things for both the New York Yankees and Oakland A's.  We the people should vote for whether the color is of the A's or the Yankees.

Attachment theory
Hello, I've noticed the general subject are of your edits and wondered if you might want to look at my new article Attachment theory and give it your touch - don't know if it is something you know about.

Also, as I happened to look at your contribs I saw you had done some work on brain imaging.  I've been wondering recently about why it is that we routinely X-ray people for internal physical problems but rarely brain scan people with behavioural difficulties or mental illness.  Am I right in assuming it's largely a matter of cost?  

As a sufferer of mental illness (clinical depression and with a bipolar family member) it would almost be a relief to me to be able to see something on a picture and go """"there, that's why I'm different"""".  Of course, I realise little is understood - but that would improve if imaging of ill people were widespread.

"Basic concept of GPS 

Hi!

There are two different issues with the introduction.  The first is style - this is supposed to be a very easy-to-read introduction.  The description as intersecting spheres is covered in much detail later in the article.  Since the article is already very long, perhaps another description is not needed in the introduction.

The second issue is the number of satellites needed.  This is 3 with an accurate clock (a ns or so will suffice).  This gives the distance to 3 satellites, which is enough to determine position.  (These will be 2 solutions, but only one can be close to the surface of the Earth, so this is not a practical problem.)  With 4 satellites you need only a crude clock, provided your hardware measures the 4 satellites at (almost) the same time.  This allows you to solve for x,y,z, and t.

That article is ok I guess, the Androgyny section could use a better explanation, but meh. I dumped some stuff into the section about docking to dead ships/stations, cause it was just so crap and WRONG. Needs some polish now, as I didn't delete anything, just added a nice read which could be trimmed, but that article is very short and could use some meat on it's bones. Anyhow """"the Shenzhou spacecraft could to dock at the International Space Station if it becomes politically feasible in the future"""" still isn't too bad because it's correct. Even if the docking adapters never existed in the first place, the statement is still true. Even if there was no USOS, the statement is still true. You see what I mean ? It could happen, doesn't mean it will, it doesn't rule out or rule in any possibilities, sure we could endlessly qualify it like """"the Shenzhou spacecraft could to dock at the International Space Station if it becomes politically feasible in the future, so long as the station is not deorbited first, or has it's budget cut, or the APAS's are covered, mangled, sold, ejected, stolen by Ivan Ivanovich, america doesn't declare war on china, ESA doesn't declare martial law on columbus"""" and so forth. It's just that it's a correct statement as is, plus, short and sweet. I'm very happy that what you are saying is correct, and belongs somewhere with other future maybe plans, however it has little to do with china because the docking is already tenuous at best, and so not going to happen in the next few years, and if it does, they will need to prepare anyway. So where is the article that outlines a hypothetical docking to the ISS to tell us where it is or isn't ? It's pretty much all speculation and too far out on a limb to outline such hypothetical within the China section, better to just mention the hypothetical possibility of docking as a point of interest and move on with the now and is. The location of the hypothetical docking would be subject to political pressures, like if ESA and RSA forced america to agree, by no longer provisioning services like transport, then it would be ROS docking, but if the US and China made up it would be an american module docking, and so forth, hardware would be provisioned to reflect the nature of the political decision.

I think, also, you may be being a bit didactic (though I've never been sure about the meaning of that word...) First and foremost, sail training is not intended to be like a vacation. or With many options out there, it can be a difficult choice . I'm not sure what advice to give to change anything, but it sails close to being a promotional piece - albeit of the very highest quality - for sail training, rather than an encyclopedia article about sail training.

"Hi Proudbolsahye. Sorry for the delay in reply. No problem about Patton, it happens. ) In regards to Maghakian's infobox, the infobox is meant to be a quick summary of information about the person, containing only key information succinctly. The ribbon icons, in my opinion, detract from the information, serve to clutter the infobox and are not the correct place for them to be. I know you pointed out the case of the John Shalikashvili article, but I think the ribbons presented in such a way in the infobox in that case is unhelpful and a waste as most people will not know what each of the ribbons denote and will have to either hover over them or click on them to find out, which should not have to be the case: it should be presented just there. The article is the place where extensive information and detail is intended to be discussed, as you have done in Maghakian, but not too much information placed in the infobox. As for the service medals, as noted above the awards section of the infobox is only meant to relate the notable awards one received, and not service medals. Maghakian is notable for his awards of the Navy Cross, Silver Star, Bronze Star and Purple Heart (the ones that should most definitely be listed in the infobox). If he had just received the service medals like everyone else who had served in his unit or the same theatres of war that he did, then he would not actually be notable enough for inclusion here.

 Joseph McCabe criticisms - lack of NPOV 

I previously added criticism to this section from Joseph McCabe, drawing from his writings in """"History's Greatest Liars"""". This was dismissed as being a fringe viewpoint. This I disagree with. I'd first note the lack of criticism of St. Francis and Franciscans, demonstrating a lack of NPOV (something commented on by others), and also a conflict of interest in Marauder40 deleting these comments, where he seems to act with a conflict of interest, being a devoted Catholic and member of a Secular Franciscan order, as noted in his bio. I do not see him as someone to act with impartiality in considering criticisms of Franciscans.

I now look at whether Joseph McCabe's views can be considered as """"Fringe"""" Joseph McCabe has an entry in Wikipedia, n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_mccabe , and was himself a Franciscan Monk till the age of 19. He therefore draws on his own background in critiquing the Franciscans, and is a recognised scholar.

Of this particular comment, the origin is not Joseph McCabe alone, he draws from """"The Middle Ages"""" by Professor James Westfall Thompson, where on page 674 he says """"With wealth the old familiar evils that had corrupted the older orders corrupted the Franciscans and Dominicans too"""". He also draws upon the writings of Father Hoetzappel, a historian of the Franciscan order, not to mention his own pertinent background and experiences.

In this light, I consider the comment I introduced earlier as appropriate to Wikipedia, providing a range of views and importantly, criticism from a recognised scholar. In will engage in this talk page, but consider other processes within Wikipedia and seek the involvement of others within Wikipedia if need be.

If  thinks that two wrongs always must make a right, he has the right to do so. But it takes all credibility out of Wikipedia to keep use incorrect sources only because they in turn copy the same mistake over and over and over and over. The system with Swedish military designations are not exclusive to aircraft or engines and have been the same since long before there were aircraft. This goes back to at least the 19th century, probably more. This is something I became aware of long time ago after spending hours digging in archives doing researches for numerous books and magazine articles about Swedish aviation history over the years. Why do you think it's SK 60 and not SK60 in the aricle(or even worse the Americanized SK-60)? The designation system is the same for Army bases, Air Force bases, Navy bases, radar, cameras, robots, airplanes, vehicles, guns, actually anything that goes into an inventory list including engines both piston and jets! Military systems anywhere are not exactly known for being flexible. Everything should be conformed the same. It should be the same with Wikipedia. If we want to spell the engine designation incorrect, then the airplane designation has to be changed to the incorrect """"SK60"""" as well! This goes for all other SAAB aircraft articles in all languages on Wikipedia! It has to be either, we can't have both! Personally I think it's easier to change a few incorrect spellings than hundreds that are already correct! After all, this is about common sense!! 

Also remember that a commercial website is often made by a webmaster who doesn't really know anything about the subject. This is not only true about Volvo Aero's web, but also the Swedish Armed Forces website who also have some similar misspellings. Sometimes they get it right though! (i.e. misspellings are not consistent on their web!) And yeah, even sorces like Jane's sometimes get it wrong!

 MSM 

Agreed

Every single source I have and Puellanivis has referred to has said that TG/TS women are considered MSM or """"along side"""" MSM. The much vaunted CDC source made it sound even less ambigous. Her very own source backed me! That TG/TS women are for the CDC's and any other medical purpose biologically male, that the MSM category does not take into account any aspec of identity. Which would include gender identity. Case closed.

The rest of this has just been about Puella and her personal feelings.   

No, my source states that gender identity is not tracked at all, so the assumption on their part is that everyone is reported as they """"biological"""" sex.  However, again, if a TS/TG were reported as female, since no gender identity information would be collected there would be no indication of which were which.  Literally TS/TG information is entirely intermingled, in some indeterminable amount.  The ambiguity of not collecting TS/TG information means that there is simply a blanket assumption about how the information is received from the CDC... the true answer is, because of the ambiguity no one knows how they're split up... the data is intermingled, and there is no way to separate the information.  Again, the answer from the CDC and from your sources is that the assumption is that MTF TS/TG are reported as MSM, and FTM are just pretty much ignored... N.B. assumption... since gender identity information isn't collected no one can say what it is.  Again, being that my medical records indicate me as female, and I continue to be asked """"are you pregnant?"""" when getting x-rays indicates that I would not be reported as a male to the CDC.

"""Welcome to Wikipedia:
Remember the five pillars of Wikipedia. 

  Wikipedia is an encyclopedia incorporating elements of general and specialized encyclopedias, almanacs, and gazetteers. All articles must strive for verifiable accuracy: unreferenced material may be removed, so please provide references. Wikipedia is not the place to insert personal opinions, experiences, or arguments. Original ideas, interpretations, or research cannot be verified, and are thus inappropriate. Wikipedia is not a soapbox; an advertising platform; a vanity press; an experiment in anarchy or democracy; an indiscriminate collection of information; or a web directory. It is not a newspaper or a collection of source documents; these kinds of content should be contributed to the Wikimedia sister projects.   Wikipedia has a neutral point of view, which means we strive for articles that advocate no single point of view. Sometimes this requires representing multiple points of view, presenting each point of view accurately, providing context for any given point of view, and presenting no one point of view as """"the truth"""" or """"the best view"""". It means citing verifiable, authoritative sources whenever possible, especially on controversial topics. When a conflict arises regarding neutrality, declare a cool-down period and tag the article as disputed, hammer out details on the talk page, and follow dispute resolution.  Wikipedia is free content that anyone may edit. All of Wikipedia's text is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike 3.0 Unported License (CC-BY-SA); much of it is also licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL). It may be distributed or linked accordingly. Recognize that articles can be changed by anyone and no individual exclusively controls any specific article; therefore, any writing you contribute can be mercilessly edited and redistributed at will by the community. Do not infringe on copyright or submit work licensed in a way incompatible with Wikipedia's licensing.  Wikipedia has a code of conduct: Respect your fellow Wikipedians even when you may not agree with them. Be civil. Avoid conflicts of interest, personal attacks and sweeping generalizations. Find consensus, avoid edit wars, follow the three-revert rule, and remember that there are  articles on the English Wikipedia to work on and discuss. Act in good faith, never disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point, and assume good faith on the part of others. Be open and welcoming.   Wikipedia does not have firm rules besides the five general principles presented here. Be bold in editing, moving, and modifying articles.

"Invitation to a research survey 

Hello Tznkai,

I am Allen Lin, a computer science PhD student at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities. Currently, we are working on a project studying the main article and sub article relationship in a purpose of better serving the Wikipedia article structure. We noticed that you've created main/sub article relationship in Chinese ceramics for Pinner. So it would be appreciated if you could take 4-5 minutes to finish the survey questions. Thanks in advance! We will not collect any of your personally information.

Thank you for your time to participate this survey. Your response is important for us!

Saying """"894 of 899"""" seems okay to me.  Saying instead that he was fifth from the bottom could mean a lot of different things.  For example, if there were six people in his class, it could mean he was ranked number two.

It's important also to keep in mind that """"class standing was not solely a function of academic performace"""" (Timberg, Americam Odyssey, 2007 printing, page 54).  The class rank also reflects the number of demerits, among other tbhings.

Zarove, I don't have yahoo, and I see no reason why you feel the need to discuss this with me privately. Everything you've brought up below can be discussed on the talk page. As I've said, I may drop by the Christian Forum once this is resolved. 

SHorter vewrsion.

2: You used my administration their ito show Im biased. I am a Zealoted Christain. This was a shameful tactic. Its absicllay """"Guilt by association."""" It sbad enough Im labled one of Holdigns followers.Yopu even tried ot prove I was a fidny by linkign me with creationism.

As I said. Letsbe civil and discuss thematter in a live chat. I think you will fidn that mroe ocndusive.

Sorry, not interested. I don't see what the point would be.  

No rellay working.

The difficulty onthe talk page is yor blatant willignness to decieve others abotu me usign the same tactic you claim I use againt Acharya. You claim that I am a covert Zelous Christain wantign to defame her, and you merley wish to defend the truth. We both know this isnt true James. You want peopel to beelive her ideas and are willignto do anyhtign to make her seem as imprsive as possibl an rmeove all oposiiton to her vies.

My Chrisytaintiy is sued asa blundgeoon. You make it osund as if I oppose Acharya base don my faiht, hate her, and vehemntly opose her, and htus want ot attakc her. You then claim the aritlce is written in sch a way that it attakcs her. No spacific exampels of attakc are shown gowever.

I can assure you, nothign ithe article that is the current ocncensus among the general posters ( As oppsoed ot the Acharyans) is derogatory towards her.

But yo wish to rmeove the links ot CHrisyain rebuttals and all critisms.

If Dorothy wants to attack Chrisgaunity, why has she then no supply of courage to stand up to their rebuttals?

Midn you, Im not th eon makign suh a rebuttal. THis is WIkipedia, and I am ever midnful fo the need tobe Unbiased. Thoughyou will nto accept hat form me.

 excessive quotes from the work of particular authors in this article 

ok. Looking at it from another way, just looking at the footnotes, you have quoted excessively from some sources:
Deitcher, David
(Deitcher, David. """"Unsentimental Education: The Professionalization of the American Artist"""".) """"Loran wrote his two article after Lichtenstein's first Pop exhibition in Los Angeles, which included the artist's life-sized versions of images from Loran's book.""""
(Deitcher, David. """"Unsentimental Education: The Professionalization of the American Artist"""".) """"Portrait of Madame Cézanne and Femme au Chapeau, both of 1962, were among the first paintings in which Lichtenstein based an image directly on a picture by an illustrious predecessor, introducing the theme of art about art. Both are presented at two removes from the original. Cézanne's portrait of his wife is transposed, with significant but subtle alterations, from a diagram book, Cézanne Composition, published a quarter of a century earlier, Lichtenstein was amused by the oversimplified and paradoxical idea that a flat diagram consisting solely of thick black outline could be used to represent the Frenchmen's work, given Cézanne's insistence on eliminating contours from his paintings as incapable of suggesting the corporeal reality of the three-dimensional motif from which he was working.""""
(Deitcher, David. """"Unsentimental Education: The Professionalization of the American Artist"""".) """"The contradictory character of the Pop object was central to an unusually lively and revealing debate late in 1963. It was Lichtenstein's earliest Pop paintings that provoked this controversy which led critic Brian O'Doherty (also an artist, under the name Patric Ireland) to identify completely new class of object: the 'handmade readymade.' Reviewing the artist's second Pop show in the New York Times, O'Doherty labeled him 'one of the worst artists in America.' Nonetheless, he also credited him with creating paintings that 'raised some of the most difficult problems in art.' O'Doherty took note of an argument that had just erupted in the art press: the September issues both of Art News and Artforum had run angry features about Pop art in general and Lichtenstein's work in particular.""""
(Deitcher, David. """"Unsentimental Education: The Professionalization of the American Artist"""".) """"...Erle Loran, who had targeted two paintings by Lichtenstein, Portrait of Mme. Cézanne and Man with Folded Arms (both 1962), in order to excoriate some of the salient features of the new art. Each painting was a characteristically brazen blowup of a diagram from Loran's book Cézanne Composition, then twenty years old.""""
(Deitcher, David. """"Unsentimental Education: The Professionalization of the American Artist"""".) """"Both Loran and O'Doherty thought it absurd that so many supporters of Pop were defending Lichtenstein by insisting that he 'transformed' rather than 'copied' his sources. Claiming that only an expert could discern the difference, O'Doherty found this hairsplitting quite beside the point. After all, it had been possible to classify direct appropriation as art since 1913, when that 'old master of innovation ,' Duchamp had 'started it all by setting up his readymades...and calling them art, leaving on us the burden of proof that they were not.' Both Loran and O'Doherty found the transformation alibi doubly annoying since it clinched the matter of Pop's high-cultural status by resorting to an altogether academic and contradictory dual defense. On one hand, Pop was art because it 'put a frame of consciousness around a major part of American life...we take for granted.' On the other, Pop was art because an artist like Lichtenstein transformed his sources 'like a good artist should'—a clichéd view of fine-art production.""""
(Deitcher, David. """"Unsentimental Education: The Professionalization of the American Artist"""".) """"For Loran, the 'transformation' or 'copy' debate was spurious: since the Abstract Expressionists had ventured 'far beyond the process of transforming nature' to produce paintings that presupposed 'no conscious source but have an identity and imagery that is autonomous,' transformation—even were it detectable in Lichtenstien's art— could only constitute aesthetic regression.""""
(Deitcher, David. """"Unsentimental Education: The Professionalization of the American Artist"""".) """"For different reasons, Lichtenstein himself shunned the transformation defense.""""
Coplans, ed.
(Coplans, ed.) """"The idea of using a closely linked subject matter within a unified style of treatment is obviously suggested in the various paintings deriving from modern masters. Man with Folded Arms and Portrait of Madame Cézanne (both 1962) are quotations of outline diagrams by Erle Loran explaining Cézanne's compositional methods and are similar in the linear black-and-white handling of the imagery.""""",0.0

Daniel 9:24-27 Daniel tells of the comming of the messiah Jesus. This was a prophecy and the Magi or wise men read the prophecy and identified the Mesiah well in advance. This proves that for men of faith prophecy is fact not mere speculation. Jesus told Thomas, """"more blessed is he that belives without first seeing"""". I have posted an article by Pastor David Bay for you to read which explains in detail the prophecy of Jesus's comming.

THE UNPARALLELED PRECISE PROPHECY

Daniel 9:24-26, """"Seventy weeks of years, or 490 years are decreed upon your people and upon your holy city Jerusalem, to finish and put an end to transgression, to seal up and make full the measure of sin, to purge away and make expiation and reconciliation for sin, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up vision and prophecy and to anoint a holy of holies. Know, therefore, and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem until the coming of the anointed one, a prince, shall be seven weeks of years, and sixty-two weeks of years; it shall be built again with city square and moat, but in troublous times. And after the 62 weeks of years, shall the anointed one be cut off (killed) and shall have nothing and no one belonging to and defending Him...""""

The remaining one week is found in verse 27, and refers to the last seven years of earth's history, the period which we know as the """"Great Tribulation"""".

The term """"Weeks of Years"""" was a common Jewish term. It meant literally seven (7) years. The term comes from God's commandment in Leviticus 25:3-4 to farm a piece of land for only six years, allowing it to lie fallow for the seventh. This seven-year period came to be known as a """"week of years"""". Therefore, Seventy Weeks of Years was 490 Hebrew years.

Note this prophecy contains three parts:

    1. 7 Weeks of Years (49 Hebrew Years)

    2. 62 Weeks of Years (434 Hebrew Years)

    3. 1 Week of Years (7 Hebrew Years)

At the precise point in history when the 7 + 62 Weeks of Years occurred, Israel could expect Messiah to announce Himself as Messiah. What great news! This means that Israel could not miss Messiah. All they had to do was to count, be cognizant of current events in Israel as they unfolded, and be aware of this prophecy.

This study will show us several things:

    1. Why the Wise Men knew the time for Messiah was close.

    2. Why Israel missed Messiah.

    3. How this applies to us today.

Let us now consider the meaning of the prophecy.

I. The Duration of the Prophecy

This prophecy stipulated that Messiah would be presented to Israel and would be killed after 69 weeks of years had elapsed from the specified starting point. When we multiply 69 times 7, we understand that the time involved here equals 483 Jewish years. Since the Jewish calendar contains 360 days, we can easily see that God is talking about 173,880 days. Therefore, we can expect that 173,880 days after the prophecy started, the Messiah would present Himself to Israel as Messiah-King.

II. The Starting Point of the Prophecy (Daniel 9:25a)

In this verse , God said the prophecy would begin """"from the going forth (the issuing) of the commandment to restore and rebuild Jerusalem..."""" At the time God gave Daniel this prophecy, Israel was a slave nation under Babylon; however, God had foretold that this slavery would last only 70 years. This 70-year period was rapidly coming to a close; indeed, non-Jewish history records that the Medo-Persian emperor Artaxerxes issued such a decree on March 14, 445 B.C. Therefore, precisely 173,880 days from this day should bring us to some significant event in Jesus' life which presented Him to the nation Israel as Messiah.

III. The Mathematics Of The Prophecy

A. The First Seven Weeks (49 Jewish Years)

If you study the book of Nehemiah, you will find the account of the Jewish pilgrimage to rebuild Jerusalem following King Artaxerxes' decree. The prophet Nehemiah assumed charge of this rebuilding effort, which was carried out in such extreme hardship and danger that the builders carried swords with them as they were building the walls. Thus was fulfilled precisely the prophecy in verse 25b,""""...it shall be built again with city square and moat, but in troublous times.""""

This effort began in 445 B.C. and culminated in 396 B.C., exactly 49 years, just as foretold.

B. The Second Period (62 Weeks of Years, 434 years)

Daniel 9:26 foretells that the """"anointed One"""" would come after this period and would then be killed. This wording is understood by most conservative scholars to refer to Jesus Christ, not at His birth, but at His presentation as the Messiah-Prince. (2) """"",0.0

 Two birds, one stone 
Dear 206.186.8.130... I have been quite content to leave Dyukov described as a historian Novosti, the state news agency, trots out to dispute Baltic lies about history. (One of several of my edits deleted, each replaced by a more strident defense of Dyukov's credentials.) Given Dyukov's command of basic facts is worse than the factual improprieties he alleges in the film, he already commands far too much space devoted to his views. However, since English-speaking viewersto whom this encyclopedia is targetedget to see Dyukov quite often on """"Russia Today"""" (Novosti's version of CNN or the BBC News), I'm supportive of leaving his commentary in (other editors have mass deleted it). Dyukov's spokesmanship as a historian """"specializing"""" in Soviet history and in debunking, in particular, Baltic """"myths"""" (he uses stronger words in his Novosti interviews) is notable whether I like it or not. However, his POV and role in the official Russian (not independent) media must remain in the article for his presence in the article to be understood and defended.
   As for my """"principles"""", they are to representing the parties and their relationships to their establishments accurately. It's obviously simpler to delete undiscussed POV anonymous IP edits as vandalism if they have no reasonable basis in actuality. But whether you register or not, whether you choose to reveal yourself or not, any edit that portrays Dyukov as a reputable historian and ignores his incestuous relationship with the Russian state media agency will continue to be deleted as totally POV.
   Your tone of questions communicates to me a wish to be blunt. I'll be happy to oblige.

Someone in WP management needs to look at the Barbara Biggs entry, as it seems to my amateur eyes to be largely an advertizement of Biggs books, and a beat-up of her deeds and status based on what is written in same self-authored books. There are some references to media who interviewed her about her books/deeds but these again rested mostly on her own opinions about herself drawn from her self-authored books. Is there not supposed to be independant verification of her claims? 58.165.69.67

 Deletion of the SKA band The Steadys 

The addition does meet your requirements.  The bass player from The Steadys (Ani Schempfe a.k.a. DJ On-E) joined the pop group Dee-Lite in 1993 after The Steadys broke up.  This fits with you requirements if I'm not mistaken.  The Steadys are also on a live album called NYC SKA LIVE which was released in 1990, so there is physical proof (Recorded media) and this I believe also fits your requirements.  Thank you!

"- From someone that you totally wronged with your bullshit and managed to get me to stop contributing very significant contributions to this site nearly a year ago now. (And I contributed a LOT in a short time and would have contributed SO much more had I continued. Things that I did: huge amounts of professional class photography given away for free (placed PD) on subjects (often providing the only pics, to this day, on the subjects in question), hundreds of pages formatted according to standards, huge amounts of latest subject matter information added and facts corrected (in some cases so new that this was the first place on the net to have it) etc. etc.) - and instead of helping me and being civil, sensible and using common sense YOU were more interested in defending a non-contributing user who (for no apparent reason) started a campaign of open violent threats, death threats, spamming and vandalism on me. You were having too much fun abusing your moderator privileges by placing temporary blocks on me, trying to stop me from making my point and trying to give this hugely offensive other user a chance to avoid a police investigation, by mod-vandalizing discussions on the subject etc. - against most other moderators (private) views even - they had the sense not to start a mod war on the subject. Your 500 page nerd-o-pedia rule-book and abusing it to the point of idiocy was more interesting to you. Apparently you felt that since you had read it, everyone else should waste at least as much time and read it too down to every last letter, or you were gonna use it against all common sense toward anyone who didn't - with no regard for the actual situation and reasons behind it, no regard for that individuals contributions, no regard for civility - and most of all, with no common sense applied whatsoever.

It's indeed too bad that most pages on nerd-o-pedia are starting to be shockingy un-maintained and obsolete, indeed dead now that the initial rush of contributors is over after a few years, and the fun is over for most people - as, the most brutal blow of all, moderators such as YOU have managed to destroy the morale of even the most serious contributors and have had them leave. They simply did not wish to spend too much time arguing or alternatively face putting up with arrogant admin behavior, because it always will start to take more of your time than contributions here, because of people like YOU, and how wrong the principles are how admins are selected here. It's all about brown-nosing with the crowd and building your giant online virtual ego and lick the ass of other even more OCD nerds who are already admins, and you're just a wannabe. 

Good ****ing luck trying to get anything edited or updated here in a year or two besides top 10 whatever pop bands may be popular at the time, the latest tv show pages and some other obsessive-compulsive nerdishm. Nobody is foolish enough to put up with the crap that comes along with the job, from people such as YOU.

For example, the pages on my subjects were very active till late 2006, and since that they have... well. Remained in the same form as the core contributors left them, as they left this site. No updates. I'm truly not the only one to eject. Not worth the effort to contribute when all you get is shitted all over, if you ever need any help.

It's kind of funny that an admin can burn out of this site too, but given your attitude back then, I'm not surprised you did. After all, there were some decent admins here back then (such as  ), and I'm sure there's a few now, but WAY too many nerds for whom it is the biggest thing of their lives, and they have to show it, and snoop their noses everywhere. But like I said, as even admins are dropping out, what do you think happened to the contributors? Many pages now are actually full of incorrect shit, because no people of expertise hang around any more to correct details, and newbies or worse, malicious trollers slowly degrade the content that once was at least somehow accurate and relevant. Admins will be happy to see updates to the page, but the fact is, most of the updates today are degenerating the pages, obfuscating subjects and adding factual errors and garbage.

And too bad you didn't quit a year ago, I might still be here, and there would probably be several thousands of lines, and few hundred articles more, along with maybe ~1000 more photographs.

In the past there was no such nation as """"Germany"""". It consisted of literally hundreds of states, some kingdoms, some duchies, some simply a city. Over the centuries these states fought against each other, allied with each other, and even absorbed each other. Each state was a proper country, and so such names as """"Brandenburg"""", """"Saxony"""", """"Hanover"""" etc defined national groupsm and cultures. It wasn't until 1871 that Gertmany became one country, and even then some regions(eg Austria) weren't invluded. Since 1871 terms like """"Hanoverian"""" and """"Bavarian"""" no longer refer to national identities because they're all just """"German"""" or """"Deutsch"""". However, if a foreign non-German people were to suddenly use the name of say 'Bavaria' as their national identity, and call their non-German language and culture """"Bavarian"""" ALL Germans would take offense to it. This is something of a no-brainer. In exactly the same way, there used to be literally hundreds of separate Greek nations, varying greatly in size, power, culture, and other things. They fought both with and against eaxh other. Today however there is a single Greek state which does not include all the historical Greek lands. However if a foreign non-Greek people were to try and appropriate a regional name that is indisputably Greek(like with Nacedonia) it will understandably anger ALL Greeks. Because Macedonia was one of those hundreds of Greek regional states. What's more today more than 80 per cent of Macedon proper is within the Greek boundaries, and not FYROM's boundaries. So thus FYROM has no legitimate claim to use the name """"Macedonia"""", except to describe its southern regions like Bitola and Ochrid(sp?) in a historical context....... Kurt Stein""",0.0

I agree that discussing legal matters in an international encyclopedia is complex due to different laws in different countries, but that does not mean that nothing can be said on them, you can make remarks in terms of some/most/almost all countries; even a vaguer expression 'may be illegal' is meaningful, because many things are legal in all countries, such as the possession of a piece of bread.
Why is it silly to put a list of things you cannot possess in an article on possession? That is the place where it belongs, unless you make the list a separate article.

Hello, Wood Dickinson. I will try to clarify a few issues. I hope doing so will be helpful to you. You have presumably seen the deletion log entry, otherwise you would not have known that I deleted the article. You will therefore have seen that the reason I deleted it was logged as """"Article that has no meaningful, substantive content"""". Indeed, the full and complete text that you posted was """"Drifter: Henry Lee Lucas. Developing entry for this film. I wrote it and produced as well. Wood Dickinson reference"""" followed by a URL. The deletion had nothing to do with copyright, nor did it indicate that I """"don't see any value"""" in having an article on the subject. The only relevance of copyright is that a completely different article on the same subject written by a different person was deleted three years ago. I expressed no opinion at all on the value or lack of value of a proper article on the subject. Wikipedia does not have """"placeholder"""" articles waiting for content to be added, as such articles are immediately visible to the readers of Wikipedia, and a web page that says words to the effect """"we haven't written this page yet, but we will"""" does not produce a good impression. Instead, if an article is being worked on but not yet ready for publication, we keep it in a """"userspace"""" page: for example, if I were to write an article on that subject then I could create a page called User:JamesBWatson/Drifter: Henry Lee Lucas, and move it to Drifter: Henry Lee Lucas when it was ready.
I give up quite a significant amount of my time to Wikipedia administration. Unfortunately a large proportion of what is posted here is vandalism, trivia, propaganda, uninformed adolescent speculation, illegal content, and other unhelpful stuff. If there weren't people willing to put time into cleaning up the mess, Wikipedia would soon degenerate into something very different from the very useful and widely consulted reference that it is. You are, of course, welcome to criticise any Wikipedia policy, and also to express rational disagreement with any particular decision I take in the course of the work I do to help implement those policies, but I disagree with your characterisation of my administrative work as """"trolling"""".
I hope these comments will be helpful to you. If you have any further questions about these matters, please feel welcome to contact me here again. However, I have no intention of getting involved in phone calls about Wikipedia work, especially not calls from one continent to another.   """,0.0

Hey there buddy, I am back:

(a quote from Kenneth Tennyson Phd.)

""""the sad thing is that our fellow here - freedom skies - appears to have been raised in america or britain and yet he seems more indian than american or british and along with that supports a radical view of the world that is peppered religious ideas... and along with that - he is educated! It is truly sad... if india industrializes and this hindutva movement holds sway, the world will see a flourishing of a very powerful and scary radicalized country.""""

Firstly, can you tell me what being American or British is? America and Britain are both made of of various immigrant and former immigrant communities from Italy, Ireland, China, Guatemala, and so forth. So, if Freedom Skies is being proud of his culture, is that evil? Secondly, you have an over negative estimation of countries outside of your clouded world. Suggestion, join the Marine Corps. That is one thing I have learned is understanding the world through travel. Thirdly, I am utterly shocked at your comment on Freedom skies being educated as being a sad thing (if not, a scary thing). Does that threaten you that Indians are educated? Please answer yes or no (no need to give a disertation or oration), thank you. Also, that statement reminds me of when the slaveowners back in the Southern part of America during the civil war used to consider Blacks getting education as a threat to their lifestyle. As a matter of fact, it was illegal for an Afro-American to go to school or even learn to read, since it was viewed as a threat to the racist slave owners. I will even go a further step to say that back then, these racists from the colonial South felt threatened that the slaves would become """"a very powerful and scary radicalized community"""".  

Regarding your previous posts, here is some food for thought. In the Marine Corps, as a Gunny Sgt. or someone in command, if you are at a bar or a party, you never show that you are drunk. If you are drunk, you do not admit it... You're basically shooting yourself in the foot by admitting that you have had a few drinks while fiddling around on wikipedia, (and in some cases, 3 cases???) learn from that pal...""",0.0

 Peter Birks 

 Peter Birks 

Dear Legis

I have had to revert most of the edits made to the article Peter Birks because they were virtually indistinguishable from Jack Beatson, 'Peter Birks' (Obituary), The Guardian (16 July 2004), accessed 18 August 2009. You appear to be the editor who was responsible for reproducing a large quantity of copyright material in this article. I am surprised to find this kind of editing being done by a lawyer with a first-class degree. Just to show to what an extent you had plagiarised the material, compare:

He became regius professor of civil law at Oxford University and a fellow of All Souls College in 1989, having held chairs at Edinburgh (1981-87) and, briefly, at Southampton. Before that, he was a tutorial fellow of Brasenose College, Oxford (1971-81), a strong law college to which he remained very close, and taught at University College London.

He was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1989, and an honorary fellow of Trinity College, Oxford, his undergraduate college, in 1994; ... He was made an honorary Queen's counsel in 1995, and served as president of the Society of Legal Scholars in 2002-03. He lectured and taught throughout the Commonwealth and in Europe. (The Guardian)

... [Birks,] with Robert Goff and Gareth Jones, [was] a key figure in the extraordinary development of the law of restitution in the last 45 years. (The Guardian)

Birks, together with Robert Goff and Gareth Jones, was a key figure in the extraordinary development of the law of restitution in the last 45 years. (Your edit)

And so it continues, including the lifting, almost wholesale, of this paragraph:

One example of his influence may be seen in the 1991 decision in Woolwich Building Society v Inland Revenue. This held, for the first time, that citizens are entitled to recover taxes paid in a case where the tax authorities are not entitled to them. The reasoning of the court of appeal closely followed that in a Birks essay but, possibly because the lawyers had adopted his arguments without attribution, the judgments do not refer to the essay. This was put right in the House of Lords, where Lord Goff described the essay as """"powerful"""". (The Guardian)

One example of his influence may be seen in the 1991 decision in Woolwich Building Society v Inland Revenue. In that case the courts [synonymous with The Guardian's original, 'This'] held, for the first time in English law [you add 'in English law'], that citizens are entitled to recover taxes paid in a case where the tax authorities had no legal right to levy them [again, synonymous with the original]. The reasoning of the court of appeal closely followed that in a Birks essay but the judgments did not refer to his writing (some critics suggest this was because the lawyers adopted his arguments without attribution) [you move a subordinate clause from the middle of the sentence to the end, varying the wording just slightly]. This was put right in the House of Lords, where Lord Goff described his writings [='the essay'] as """"powerful"""". (Your edit)

You copy a bit more copyright material, and at the end of the article even clumsily leave in, '· Peter Brian Herrenden Birks, academic lawyer, born October 3 1941; died July 6 2004'.

Disappointing editing from a highly educated member of the legal profession.

"TVTimes images
Hi Ben! You've recently uploaded and added to articles some images of covers of TVTimes magazine. You've correctly tagged them as fair-use/magazine, but I don't think the images are being used under fair-use considerations.

The tag for fair-use/magazines says:

...It is believed that the use of low-resolution images of magazine covers: to illustrate the publication of the issue of the magazine in question,...

The images are being used to illustrate programmes, not the TVTimes magazine. Therefore I'd say they're not being fairly used under the terms of Wikipedia's fair-use copyrights policy.

Additionally, the tag says ...To the uploader: please add a detailed fair use rationale for each use, as described on Wikipedia:Image description page, as well as the source of the work and copyright information. These images do not have a fair use rationale on the image page and they don't provide the source of the work (scan, taken from another website etc).

I suspect that the images will need to be removed from the articles you've put them in, but I'd be interested in hearing your views. Thanks ➨ ❝REDVERS❞

 A response to """"For the attention of the IPs inserting the 'racism section'"""" 

I inserted facts documenting instances of named sources accusing Catherine Glick of racism.  I'd like to take a moment to address comments in the """"For the attention of the IPs inserting the 'racism section.'""""

Please do not misinterpret documentation of allegations of racism for allegations themselves.  The section inserted, apparently subject to some controversy, is """"accusations of recism.""""  In that section, the accusations of racism that several writersEileen Read, Alex Pareene, and Paul J. Balleshave leveled at Caroline Glick are documented.  Properly, no opinion or point of view has been expressed in the """"Allegations of racism"""" section as to the veracity of these allegations.  

1.  I therefore cannot understand why documenting such allegations could be considered controversial, let alone """"potentially libelous"""" as you say.  The documentation of specific allegations of racism by named sources need only prove that such allegations exist, not their veracity.  Documentation of written defenses of Ms. Glick's work are solicited and in fact highly encouraged.  

2.  I apologize for linking to www.youtube.com.  The link I should have used was the one from Ms. Glick's homepage.  That link is at: http://www.carolineglick.com/e/2010/06/we-con-the-world-the-gaza-fl.php

3.  I never claimed to be other than a single user even though, incidentally, all of the contributions to the """"Allegations of racism"""" section are not mine.  

Incidentally, if it matters, I for my part am a fan of Ms. Glick's work and do not believe that she is a racist.  I contributed to the section to advance the Wikipedia mission to provide a forum where issues of public significance can be documented in a way as to provide reasoned information to the public.  one of Ms. Glick's detractors, Eileen Read, wrote an article in the Huffington Post accusing Ms. Glick of racism and asking that she be fired.  The article is making rounds all over the internet and has likely been read by hundreds of thousands, if not many more.  It'd be a great shame from my perspective if Ms. Glick's career suffered as a result of such charges (since they are, in my own personal view, baseless)such charges should be documented neutrally and weighed against the writings of Ms. Glick and her defenders, aiming only to inform the public, which can then decide.  When I inserted a reference arguing that Ms. Glick's positions are """"not racist"""" but """"common sense,"""" it was taken down by those same persons invoking BLP standards and undue weight.

I'm indifferent. I have work to do on-wiki, but I also have plenty to do off-wiki. If you believe that the welfare of the project will be better served by an unblock, then consider yourself free to do it, within what is allowed as to reversing administrative decisions. Probably Future Perfect should be consulted, unless there is consensus that his block was involved (notice the dispute section above, and if more information is needed  that section was not accompanied by evidence about the existing dispute because I didn't want to write it as the first approach. But, if asked to do so, I would.)

You would be best working with me then not against me, as without Valor there would not be a christian death either, as Rozz did leave it behind.

Unfortunately, the Eva O thing is unfounded fact she has actually never participated in Christian Death, Valor has never even met her.  The fact that she was close to Rozz at some stage in his life does not make her a member of Christian Death or the illegal touring that they did under that name. 

You need to make sure that the infobox at the top states the CURRENT LINEUP and its active status.  To leave it out/ replacing it in this way is damaging my clients representation on this page, which that way is not a good thing to do.

 Blanco, Hitler and Mussolini 

Just some small factual stuff, in the section Spain After Franco, it is said that Adm. Blanco was killed by a car bomb, but he wasn't, the ETA had instead placed a bomb in a tunnel underneath the car and exploded it as Blanco drove on the street above.

Also, in the section Relationship with Hitler and Mussolini, it says: """"While Franco ruled undemocratically, he seems to have reluctantly accepted that Spain would be a democracy after his death."""" This isn't true at all, the only reason Franco worked with the western democracies was because Spain was in dire need of the supplies they could provide for Spain's weak economy, and later on, during the 50's and 60's, it was because Franco's advisors realized the need for Spain to take place in the burgeoning international economy. Franco was a devout enemy of democracy, and thought throughout his entire life that it would lead to anarchy or communism.""",0.0

"Unbelievably Biased Article - Not Fair 

This article is solely written and guarded by Britney's stubborn and standoffish fans; I do not see NPOV at all. They try to eliminate every negative material on Britney, but everyone knows what kind of person Britney is and we all know the schizophrenic thngs she does. Where is the information of Britney being a no-show at the Allure Mag's interview? Where is the information of her being diagnosed with bipolar disorder?   Where is the information of Britney's former bodyguard speaking out? Where is the information of her being under the influence? Where is the information of Britney spending more time partying (with Paris Hilton, nonetheless) than being with her kids or concentrating on her music career? What about the fact that she was seen without underwear, more than once? All of us KNOW why Britney mangled her VMA performance! She was seen partying in Las Vegas 2 days in a row than focusing on getting her performance right!

This theory states that the Universe was originally all matter. The theory is based on the fact that a vacuum can only be created when work is done. The exact proportion and density of the original matter is not known. It is only an educated guess that the matter was a gas. The Gas Theory states: 1 Space is infinite = n/1 2 Matter is infinite = n/1 3 Time is infinite 4 Energy is the reactant

n/1 matter + energy = (n/1 space + (1/n matter - energy))

The starting point is theoretical: Matter n/1 + n/1 energy = space n/1/ matter 1/n - n/1 energy “ n/1 over 1/n “ equals an """"open proportion"""" an unknown balance. Since the universe is not subject to proportion, all things are technically part of a type of gas.

The Gas Theory

The GAS THEORY states that a GAS in some low density form or equal to or proportional to: 1/infinite times a Helium atom (or any particle). (matter/space-energy) is/was the """"original substance"""". A property-less gas. This gas had POTENTIAL energy. Ironically only because it was substance and had mass.... This GAS was... At a single volume, pressure, and temperature. First the GAS condensed some. Then the GAS developed some properties... 1st, the variation of volume... CREATED the WEAK FORCE from Vacuum/MATTER 2nd, the variation of pressure... CREATED GRAVITATION from condensation/MATTER 3rd, the variation of temperature... CREATED ELECTROMAGNETISM from hot and cold +(P,T,V)/MATTER 4th, friction developed (KINETIC ENERGY)... This CAUSED electrical activity, condensations and... """"Dynamic cosmic relationships"""" A gaseous-energetic cloud of """"Microwave laden matter/energy reactions."""" All these (1-4) CAUSED and CREATED The STRONG FORCE (HIGHLY KINETIC AND CONDENSED MATTER) Which lead to... Spontaneous disintegration's and atomic radiation. All this lead to the universe as we know it..

Matter which we know exists and is the basis for all things remains The foundation of all things.... With the BIG BANG nothing must become something With GAS THEORY Matter CREATES SPACE from a void in MATTER The events that are described are """"Reasonable and logical""""

They also recorded at least one track in Jamaica, and managed to squeeze in the sessions for Ellen Foley's

 Supercategories 

Hi Daniel

I just noticed on the Mariners article seems to have a couple of super-categories, Sport in NSW is a supercat of Football (soccer) in NSW, and Australian football (soccer) teams is a supercat of A-League teams.  It's a minor point but are the supercats necessary if you've already identified more specific cats?   
Ah, yes, you raise a very good point. I must say, categories have never been my strong point; the best example was Wikipedia:Featured list candidates/FIFA World Cup hat-tricks, when I submitted it to FLC without even adding them (I forgot about their existance totally).

Concerning removal of a lead pic 
this has been pasted from talk page of  Elekkh:

Architecture 

Concerning your removal of one of the lead pic that was added today: I have been looking for an appropriate image that contrasted a modern city with the wide view of Florence.  

The two pictures (and their captions) refer, in one case, to the impact of a single architect and a single structure on a city and on architecture and the architect.   The second picture demonstrates very clearly the uniformity created by 20th century structures of the so-called International style.  Although in the body of the article, almost every building is individually notable,  and such is not the case in that picture, the picture demonstrates a significant trend in architecture.  

The article is not simply about significant buildings.   In each case, the significant buildings has been selected to demonstrate the aesthetics or principals of a wide region and era, or an architectural philosophy.  

I want to emphasise that the image of Florence Cathedral has not been selected simply on the grounds of it being a great representative work of architecture (like the Parthenon, St Peter's Basilica or the Taj Mahal). It is not simply an iconic building.  It is the building that launched the notion of the """"architect"""". 

The homogeneity of the Manhattan skyline is the antithesis of the image of Florence.  Read the two captions. I believe they make the point, without labouring it. 

  
I understood your intention, but still that image is not a good illustration of international style, neither is it a very good quality picture. T  

To say again what I said above:
""""The homogeneity of the Manhattan skyline is the antithesis of the image of Florence.  Read the two captions. I believe they make the point, without labouring it.""""  
While I agree that the image is not as high quality as it could be, the two images complement each other in terms of colour and appearance.   It is the picture of Lower Manhattan which in terms of colour and proportion fits best with the image of Florence. It includes the Twin Towers which were so much part of that landscape. 
And while I agree that the image may not show International style as well as an image of a single building might, it illustrates extremely well the affect of the style in transforming cities.  Lower Manhattan is """"iconic"""" in that regard.

"MSU Interview 

Dear Woohookitty,

My name is Jonathan Obar user:Jaobar, I'm a professor in the College of Communication Arts and Sciences at Michigan State University and a Teaching Fellow with the Wikimedia Foundation's Education Program. This semester I've been running a little experiment at MSU, a class where we teach students about becoming Wikipedia administrators. Not a lot is known about your community,  and our students (who are fascinated by wiki-culture by the way!) want to learn how you do what you do, and why you do it. A while back I proposed this idea (the class) to the community HERE, where it was met mainly with positive feedback. Anyhow, I'd like my students to speak with a few administrators to get a sense of admin experiences, training, motivations, likes, dislikes, etc. We were wondering if you'd be interested in speaking with one of our students.

So a few things about the interviews:
 Interviews will last between 15 and 30 minutes.
 Interviews can be conducted over skype (preferred), IRC or email. (You choose the form of communication based upon your comfort level, time, etc.)
 All interviews will be completely anonymous, meaning that you (real name and/or pseudonym) will never be identified in any of our materials, unless you give the interviewer permission to do so.
 All interviews will be completely voluntary. You are under no obligation to say yes to an interview, and can say no and stop or leave the interview at any time.
 The entire interview process is being overseen by MSU's institutional review board (ethics review). This means that all questions have been approved by the university and all students have been trained how to conduct interviews ethically and properly.

Bottom line is that we really need your help, and would really appreciate the opportunity to speak with you. If interested, please send me an email at obar@msu.edu (to maintain anonymity) and I will add your name to my offline contact list. If you feel comfortable doing so, you can post your name  instead.

If you have questions or concerns at any time, feel free to email me at obar@msu.edu. I will be more than happy to speak with you.

Thanks in advance for your help. We have a lot to learn from you.

Romanticide premiered live in 2009, at Brixton Academy in London. It featured Marco and Anette on vocals. If someone wants to put a corrected sentence to this effect back into the article, feel free. However I don't think it's worth it as that part of the article is detailing songs that HAVE NOT been played live.""",0.0

Alright chump, I've grown bored of messing around with your inane contributions, but rest assured that I could keep this up for years if, unlike you, I didn't have better things to do.

I don't understand why you want to spend so much time out of your life pretending that you're some sort of Wikipedia patrol officer.  Seems to me that pretty much all you do is tag other people's pages for deletion.  Seems to me it must be predicated on some sort of megalomania.

This whole charade about an encyclopedia that 'anyone can edit' is given the lie by chumps like you.  All I wanted to do was write a page about an author I'm interested in, but your arrogant and ignorant deletion of the start of that has put me off bothering with it again.

I noticed that when you tagged it for deletion you removed the very clear indication at the top that it was a beginning and that it needed development.  This meant that the next person who came along had no idea that there was more to follow.  Why didn't you just tag it as a stub?  Because you're so wrapped up in your pathetic power trip that you just wanted to alienate me?

And who are you to decide who's 'notable' and who isn't?  I figure anyone with a dozen published works (which is easily verifiable) is notworthy by any definition of the term  except, clearly, the subjective definition you store somewhere in your tiny brain.

So congratulations, chump.  Enjoy policing this web site.  Where would the world be without heroes like you?",0.0

I asked about sources out of curiosity, not to undermine what you said.  In a Jamaican context what you say is true - from what I cited (and some other reading) I would say that """"Taino"""" is preferable to Arawak for the Greater Antilles because it is more specific in that context.

As far as I can tell, it is to these groups (the """"classic Taino"""") plus their related neighbours (the """"eastern Taino"""" and the """"western Taino"""") that they name Taino applied.  The point is not the word as such, since it was probably not a word that they used for themselves except to proclaim themselves """"friendlies"""" to the Spanish.  There was a distinct culture of the northern Caribbean...before I looked it up I though the Lucayans of the Bahamas were not part of that group, but I was wrong.  Words only work if they can be fit to real meaningful concepts.
The term """"Igneri"""" has been used for the """"Island Arawaks"""" who preceded the Island Caribs in the Lesser Antilles.  This group probably made up the basic substratum of the Island Carib population, and gave rise to the """"Kalinago"""" (or women's language) of the Island Caribs.  The men spoke either a Carib language or a Carib-based pidgin, but apparently it had a lot of Arawak words.
The """"traditional"""" view of the Island Caribs as interlopers has been severely questioned in recent times.  One source separated out three theories of their origin.  The traditional one (and the one I got in school, etc.) was the """"Carib replacement"""" model - that the Caribs invaded and displaced the original Arawak population of the Lesser Antilles, and were spreading northward at the time of Spanish contact.  Another one is the """"Arawak continuity"""" model which says that the Arawaks of the Lesser Antilles acquired a Carib pidgin through trading with the Mainland Caribs.  The third is a reticulate model in which Mainland Caribs moved into the Lesser Antilles and merged with the Arawak population in a model comparable to the Norman conquest of England.  I got the impression that modern scholars leaned that way.  One source cited seventeenth century documents that refer to two groups of """"Caribs"""" in Grenada, the Galini (probably Kaliña/Karinya, or Mainland Caribs) and the Caraïbes (Island Caribs).  In addition, contemporary sources refer to the Taino of the Greater Antilles fleeing Spanish massacres and joining the Island Caribs.  In the Spanish period the Island Caribs changed from being enemies of the Puerto Rican Tainos to being their allies against the Spanish.  (Main source: Raiders and Traders: Caraïbe Social and Political Networks at the Time of European Contact and Colonization in the Eastern Caribbean - Ann Cody Holdren, 1998, Ph.D. dissertation, UCLA; McGinnis's dissertation - cited above - has a lot of quotes from Columbus's journals and from other contemporary sources).
Arawak (or aruaca), as I mentioned, comes from aru which was the Lokono word for cassava flour.  
I am not a historian, just trying to do my best to see what the primary literature says.  The use of the word Taino is standard for the Greater Antilles, but whether it is """"accurate"""" is another matter altogether.  McGinnis points out that Columbus was very selective in how he interpreted data - if you were hostile, then human limbs were proof you were Carib, but if you were friendly, then the heads he found in the village was funerary.  Of course the whole idea of the origin of the Caribs is controvertial.  But the traditional view is by no means accepted without question.  That's what makes history so exciting these days.   23:40, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)""",0.0

I can cast some light on:

1. CZMarlin's contribution 

CZMarlin is a tireless promoter of AMC vehicles (he owns at least two and has a website dedicated to AMC products). As he knows, I have developed the view that he seems to use the project quite persistently as a PR medium for the defunct corporation and its products. It is, I believe, to this end that, it seems to me, he has habitually fought against sourced material that brings neutrality and balance to articles on AMC products, e.g. AMC Pacer, Gremlin etc.  

It is true that I was deeply frustrated by the apparent determination with which he misrepresented others’ contributions in order to justify their deletion, e.g. . I was also frustrated by his apparent insistence on idiosyncratic and erroneous interpretations of the English language, and also by what appeared to be deliberately erroneous interpretation of verifiable facts, e.g.   errors that cannot be permitted in an  encyclopedia.  

My sincere belief that English was not CZM’s first language arose from the manner in which he uses it and the difficulties of communicating with him. (Examples on request.) I disagree that I belittled him for it – as a non-native English speaker myself, it's not something I would do.  Indeed I offered to help him with the language (offer ignored) and told him he could seek help from WP volunteer translators, so that he could write in Polish (also ignored).  

True, I ridiculed him when his behaviour seemed so extreme as to appear ridiculous to me.  I should not have done so. But we get frustrated when we try to work with an editor who, it seems, demonstrates provocatively scant regard for factual accuracy, neutrality, balance and clarity of communication . Granted, I should not have let my frustration show. 

The 'known vandal' CZM mentions is in fact an IP address used by one or more people. The address had a history of vandalism. When I saw a constructive edit from it I tried to encourage the contributor in her/his constructive behaviour; and later suggested the sandbox for experiments:  , . My posts encouraged constructive behaviour. 

CZM's damaging claim that these posts encouraged disruptive behaviour is totally false. (This gives a flavour of the difficulties I had with him.) It also casts serious doubt on the reliability of his contribution here, and also on his good faith.

He implies that my use of the term 'AMC cuckoos' was insulting. Not so, as he well knows, because I explained it to him when he showed that he had misunderstood the idiom: I used the term in an edit summary to describe the long-winded and inappropriate descriptions of certain AMC cars that he had introduced  like cuckoos in a nest  into an article on a certain aspect of automotive aerodynamics .

My  'another sophomoric CZM error' was mischievous but (IMO) harmless retaliation for CZM’s previous sniffy dismissal of some Google research I had posted to a discussion, which he denigrated as 'sophomoric research'. He seems to have forgotten that.  

The reference to 'little fuhrer' is more serious, and I should not have used it even though it mentioned no names (so no harm done to CZM’s reputation). Why that particular metaphor? I’m afraid I regarded CZM’s approach to editing as uncollaborative and perfunctory to the point of being dictatorial; and ruthless in its uncritical promotion of AMC and its products.

2. Collect’s contribution 

Just as he could list my transgressions (""""I have a list of [Writegeist's] comments""""), so also could I recite a litany of his own. Meh. Tit for tat gets us nowhere.

However it is worth noting that an antagonism grew between us at the Sarah Palin pages when it became apparent to Collect that I disagreed with much of his input, whereas he had assumed from one of my earliest contributions there that I would be an ally (he left an appreciative note on my Talk). Yet despite the difficulties between us, it was with scrupulous fairne",0.0

"MSU Interview 

Dear Dabomb87,

My name is Jonathan Obar user:Jaobar, I'm a professor in the College of Communication Arts and Sciences at Michigan State University and a Teaching Fellow with the Wikimedia Foundation's Education Program. This semester I've been running a little experiment at MSU, a class where we teach students about becoming Wikipedia administrators. Not a lot is known about your community,  and our students (who are fascinated by wiki-culture by the way!) want to learn how you do what you do, and why you do it. A while back I proposed this idea (the class) to the community HERE, were it was met mainly with positive feedback. Anyhow, I'd like my students to speak with a few administrators to get a sense of admin experiences, training, motivations, likes, dislikes, etc. We were wondering if you'd be interested in speaking with one of our students.

So a few things about the interviews:
 Interviews will last between 15 and 30 minutes.
 Interviews can be conducted over skype (preferred), IRC or email. (You choose the form of communication based upon your comfort level, time, etc.)
 All interviews will be completely anonymous, meaning that you (real name and/or pseudonym) will never be identified in any of our materials, unless you give the interviewer permission to do so.
 All interviews will be completely voluntary. You are under no obligation to say yes to an interview, and can say no and stop or leave the interview at any time.
 The entire interview process is being overseen by MSU's institutional review board (ethics review). This means that all questions have been approved by the university and all students have been trained how to conduct interviews ethically and properly.

Bottom line is that we really need your help, and would really appreciate the opportunity to speak with you. If interested, please send me an email at obar@msu.edu (to maintain anonymity) and I will add your name to my offline contact list. If you feel comfortable doing so, you can post your name  instead.

If you have questions or concerns at any time, feel free to email me at obar@msu.edu. I will be more than happy to speak with you.

Thanks in advance for your help. We have a lot to learn from you.

Sincerely,

Jonathan Obar",0.0

Dear , you say that in RWP there are """"Many small unsignificant parties are claiming as """"the official representative"""", """"president"""", etc."""" It's not right. After the National Congress III (few days ago), some leaders of these parties were jailed by Indonesian government. These organizations were mostly closed after getting their politicians jailed. The only parties left were WPLO (I am representative of it in Russia), KNPB and WPNLA. And all these parties made a coalition at 25th October.

 Personally, I feel there is a big difference between CLAIM and INTEND.

 from EMDR Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is a psychotherapeutic approach developed by Francine Shapiro[1] to resolve symptoms resulting from exposure to a traumatic or distressing event, such as rape.

Summarized: EMDR is INTENDED to....

Hypnotherapy Hypnotherapy is often applied in order to modify a subject's behavior, emotional content, and attitudes, as well as a wide range of conditions including dysfunctional habits, anxiety, stress-related illness, pain management, and personal development.

Summary: Intention
 
Cognitive Therapy Cognitive therapy seeks to identify and change """"distorted"""" or """"unrealistic"""" ways of thinking, and therefore to influence emotion and behaviour.
Summary: intention

Interpersonal Therapy Interpersonal therapy (IPT) is a form of psychotherapy used to treat a variety of mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, bulimia nervosa, and communication disorders.

Summary: is used to treat (effectiveness implied?))

psychotherapy Psychotherapy is an interpersonal, relational intervention used by trained psychotherapists to aid clients in problems of living.
I like the INTERVENTION, I dont like used to aid, as this implies 100% effectiveness??

Chiropractic Chiropractic (from Greek chiros and praktikos meaning """"done by hand"""") is a health care profession whose purpose is to diagnose and treat mechanical disorders of the spine and musculoskeletal system with the intention of affecting the nervous system and improving health.[1] It

Summary: (purpose = ) Intend.

Faith Healing Faith healing, also called divine healing or spiritual healing, is the use of spiritual means in treating disease, It is purportedly a supernatural manifestation that brings healing and deliverance from all kinds of diseases whether organic, functional, or psychological.

Purport Strongly POV. The condemnation can be felt.

 
Interventions are INTENDED, practitioners (all sorts) CLAIM. The effectiveness and criticism should, in my POV, be in a seperate section.

 Vincent Lefèvre Crap 

He insistently replaces simple illustration (it was asked above), which says that floating the point is equivalent to choosing scale (micro- vs. kilo- vs. giga-), which you do every day, with opposite statement """"floating point allows to measure both astronomical and atomic scales using single measurement unit"""". You do not measure galactic distances with millimetres. Vincent Lefèvre is idiot. He also eliminates further illustration which reminded that scale selection corresponds to discarding least significant bits and ten-bit exponent can denote discarding of hundreds of bits of """"single unit of measurement"""" (when you pass from mm to light years you discard hundreds of least significant digits in fact and, thus, pass, to a different unit), which is real idea behind introducing the floating point (exponent), disliked by Vincent Lefèvre. It is difficult to say what Vincent had in mind in his """"clarification"""" edit. I cannot find any sense in it. Did he just wanted to repeat the that trivial idea that fp enables huge range one more time? Why should this take over much more insightful illustration, which explains much more, the idea and mechanics which stand behind the trick and provided the sense of compression achieved. Why to remove the illustrative material just to repeat the truism that you've seen above? Do you want to say that technical material does not need the gentle introduction/overview?   """,0.0

First of all I have nothing against you or Rouvas (who is an artist I actually like) in case there is a misunderstanding. I read the changes and I have to admit that you did a very good job... but I still think you exagerate in general about Rouvas. He's not perfect in everything as the whole bio clearly slows. And the movie Sta Akra (because I live in Greece) was not a BIG box office hit... Don't live in a bubble. And in the article there's only one positive review from Zoumboulakis praising his performance and the movie itself. In this case only one review means that his performance was indeed good and proves a point and many """"random reviews"""" cannot prove that a movie was good or bad in the case of Alter Ego? (and let's face it... it was a really bad movie, but that's my opinion). You repeatedly put info in the Anna Vissi article, stating her commercial decline. Apagorevmeno sold 27.000 units (2x platinum) and it was her lowest selling album. You can't say that. I believe Rouvas' """"Parafora"""" certified double platinum, or am I wrong? I am not sure. But if it's true how many units did he sold. There must be around 25.000 units or more, right? That means it's his lowest selling album, right? If it is I didn't see you writing on his article!!! So, some things apply for Vissi and not for Rouvas. I think it's unfair and you're being highly impartial. Not to mention that Rouvas never made huge sellings (like 7 platinum that Vissi did) but he still is a big selling artist so his decline cannot be that obvious like Vissi and Vandi. (I really hope you get my point and what exactly I'm trying to say to you). So it's not easy or even possible to reach a 7 platinum status again in someone's career and especially in this period. I'm not mad about anything especially for a bad review that concerns Vissi. I'm used to it.

"""==Vandalism Manifesto. Pass to all Wikians==

VANDALISM IS GOOD. Vandalism does not come from a sheer desire to cause harm.
Vandals do their thing all over Wiki, 24/7, from frustration and hatred, 
because incompetent """"editors"""" who have no skills, no degrees, no expertise, usually no names, have done multiple reverts and edits of the work of others.
Vandalism is a good and natural response to no-lifers (as in Get a Life) who 
do 7000 edits, 10,000 edits a year and who have actual Watch Lists of 1,300
or more and are proud of it. These jerks deserve have their own pages vandalized, over and over as long as they are in effect, vandalizing the pages of others in the name of being a cop. Vandals keep no-life editors, admins, 
bureaucrats and stewards honest, or at least busy, reverting the reverts they get on their own pages. VANDALISM IS GOOD. It helps drive these nutcases into the ground with nervous breakdowns. The Culture of Wikipedia is very,very sick,

 Sorry that you feel this way, Malangali. I don't suppose that I can persuade you, but I did try and do my homework. Iringa is not offically designated a city at present (unlike Mwanza, Dar and Arusha); you asserted this in the article, but it is simply factually incorrect. A seperate question is whether Iringa can be referred to as a city outside of the Tz government's definition. OK. First, I assure you that """"urban"""" can imply either town or city, particularly when contrasted with """"rural"""": see urban area. I checked two English language travel guides for Tanzania, both of whom use """"town"""". Moreover, I contacted some Tanzanians in Iringa, who agreed that it was """"town"""" rather than a """"city"""" (not that personal anecdotes are a reliable source in Wikipedia, just to try and convince you that the """"town"""" thing is not just from some deluded mzungu insisting on a patronising colonial viewpoint, or whatever it is you've decided I am doing).
 I don't believe in individual ownership of Wikipedia articles. However, """"city"""" is not the best word here, and it's entirely reasonable for me to oppose it. Again, I regret clashing with you on this, and I'm very happy to discuss and change my mind on things, and I'm glad you've improved this article, but I'm afraid I will not simply agree with whatever you say just because I'm English and you (I presume) are a Tanzanian.

You're both right in the sense that enough is enough. If you haven't noticed, I've hardly contributed a thing to the RefDesk in quite a while. If you also haven't noticed, many other valuable editors who used to contribute regularly just, say, a year ago, are now long gone. I suppose I was left the only one to hold the fort. It's now clear, however, that you simply don't appreciate what's happening here, and no matter how hard I try, you never will.

I know this will be futile, but I'll explain how I see things one last time: The Humanities RefDesk used to be a wonderful place to learn. OPs would ask questions, and a decent variety of intellectuals would put in their admittedly POV two-cents, with the result of providing the OP with a variety of differing POV answers, which is basically the closest one can get to an NPOV answer to any """"humanities"""" related topic. This was the Humanities RefDesk I fell in love with.

Now, however, it's pretty much dominated by one supposed omniscient Cambridge Phd. One who verbally abuses other editors in the cruelest and most sadistic of manners due to the """"folly"""" she percieves in their contributions (while the admins conveniently turn a blind eye). One who is incapable of those all-too-human facets known as humilty and fallability. This editor proceeds upon handing down, as if from above, her more-often-than-not flawed, revisionist, biased, and downright incorrect responses (and from my own ethnic POV, extremely offensive and insulting to the memory of my family) to historical questions. When these responses are succesfully challenged, she is incapable of responding in a civil manner (not just to me) and lowering herself to """"stand corrected"""".

These, to me, are not the makings of a RefDesk editor, nor a proper historian. 

But once again, you're right. Enough is enough. I've spent far too much time and effort on this. If you'd indeed prefer the Humanities RefDesk to degenerate into a ClioBlog, then that last obstacle you've been facing, little old Loomis51, has given up. I fought the good fight, and I'm damned proud of it. This, to me, is truly a sad day for Wikipedia.

This is no grand exit, no demand to be blocked, nothing melodramatic like that. I still love Wikipedia and its articles. Unfortunately that once great Humanities RefDesk that I couldn't wait to come to visit upon returning home from work, in order to learn new things, and (hopefully) return the favour by sharing whatever I know with others, is no longer. 

I'm not really sure what all those nonsensical """"conditions"""" you noted above were, nor did I pay much attention to them. Whether my words above are some sort of """"breach"""" of those conditions, I have no idea, nor do I care. 

I just can't help but find it funny that you've extended your jurisdiction to Wikiversity. What's next? If you can somehow hack into my Yahoo account, will my emails now be scrutinized for any anti-Clio content? How about MSN? Is it ok if I call Stu up on the phone and speak """"inappropriately"""" of her? lol (Not that either of us really cares about all this bullshit to actually talk on the phone about it, we have lives, you know! We've never even spoken on the phone, and interestingly, I know rather little about him except that he's apparently from Detroit and that we disagree on pretty much every issue except for the fact that Clio's a fraud! I'm actually rather curious. I've often wondered if Stu is perhaps some obese Asian guy, some skinny Black guy, some white senior citizen, or whatever!) 

If you want to block me, then block me. If you don't, then don't. It's all so obviously arbitrary that I really don't give a shit at this point what you do. All you should know is that I'm just pretty much fed up with the whole RefDesk farce, and I don't really see myself engaging in it in any way any time soon. I have absolutely no intention of any further """"Doctor Anastasia"""" bashing, as like I said, it's futile. If you don't believe me, then block me. If not, then don't. Do as you please.

Let me just mark this day, June 4th, 2007. Let's just see how the Humanities RefDesk looks in say, six months from now: December 4th, 2007. Will all be as is? Will any of my remarks ring any truer? Let's just see. In the meantime, adios muchachos!

Quantrill's Raiders

Thank you for your copy edits and reference work on the article Quantrill's Raiders. You have, by your edits, cleaned up most if not all of the NPOV issues I had with the article. I know I did not have the resources available nor the time at the moment to do much with the article; but I was pretty sure that someone would if I tagged it. My editing doesn't involve Civil War articles but only as they are co-incidental the the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service and the revenue cutters that operated during and immediately after the Civil War and almost all my reference materials involve the USRCS or it's successor agency, the U.S. Coast Guard. As a Kansan interested in Kansas history I realize that the origins of the Civil War began as far back as the Missouri Compromise and later with the Kansas-Nebraska Act. As a Kansan, one is sometimes referred to as a 'Jayhawk' and that is how I ran across the article on Quantrill's Raiders. It was interesting to me, but I saw NPOV issues with it. Anyway, thanks for your edits and when you feel that the article has been edited enough to warrant removal of the tag, you certainly have my blessing. Cuprum17 (talk)

I don't think the problem is with including Latin as an example, but rather that after 'veni, vidi, vici' it gives a """"literal"""" translation as 'came, saw, conquered' and then an """"idiomatic"""" translation that reads 'I came, etc.' The problem is that 'came, saw, conquered' would not be considered a """"literal"""" translation by any Latin scholar or teacher. I am a Latin teacher and I would expect the pronoun expressed in an English rendering since it's clearly expressed in the Latin. The """"literal"""" translation implies that Latin doesn't mark person and number on verbs, which is of course false. Now that I look at the other examples it looks like this problem pervades the article. Someone is trying to """"recreate"""" the effect of such languages (I call them pro-drop) in English. The problem is that you can't create the effect in English, which is one of the points of the article, i.e. English is not a null-subject language! 'came, saw, conquered' does not create the effect that a Latin speaker would feel upon hearing 'veni, vidi, vici', in fact 'I came, I saw, I conquered' is as close as one can get to create the effect of this phrase in English.""",0.0

That is absolutely false.
You posted a """"civility warning"""" in my talk page.
That was the only time that you posted there, ever, for this issue.
My reaction to that, was to come here to ask what happened.
We discussed it here, and when the discussion ended, without any result, I removed the civility warning from my talk page, because I use to archive / remove old conversations in my talk page.
Automatically, wen you saw I had removed the civility warning, you blocked me for a 24 hour period.
Your block was absolutely illegitimate, for various reasons:
The way you did it:
The reason you gave to block me was: """"Yes, I've seen the comment on your talk page. This was the combination of mine and his responses to your previous question."""". And few minutes later, you posted """"24 hour block issued"""".
All this information was posted in your own talk page, and talking to another user.
You did not communicate to me that you had blocked me. I did not see that you had blocked me until, few days later the block had expired, I came to your talk page, and saw that you had said that you had blocked me.
In addition, by not communicating me that I was blocked, you did not allow me to ask other admins to review my block.
The reasons why you did it:
It is not stated anywhere in this Wikipedia that an user cannot remove stuff from his talk page.
You neither told me not to remove that stuff.
I accepted and fulfilled your request of having a civil attitude. Ignoring what I had done before (which was not much), since the moment you told me that, I kept a civil attitude.
I also lost my time coming here to reply you, so there is no possible way to say that I ignored your request.
In all, your block was just full of irregularities. It was not a normal admin block, but rather a thoughtless decission that you took without following any kind of procedure. You just decided that I had to be blocked because you might think that removing the civility warning that you had posted in my talk page was some kind of lack of respect towards you. But it is frankly stupid to think that way, because of the reasons I've explained above.
And since you realized that you had comitted an enormous mistake, that you had used your admin powers despotically, you just repeatedly ignored the requests that I did to you in your own talk page, where I asked you why had you blocked me (this one, and this one), adding to your unjustified attitude towards me, a high grade of arrogance.
In addition, you are threatening me. Read well what I wrote:
""""Hello? Why did you block me? Since when removing a civility warning from one's talk page is something that deserves a block? You did not even communicate my block to my talk page. I am stil waiting for a justification of your abusive attitude as admin. You not only block for no reason but you also ignore people's requests of justification!"""".
Where do you see a lack of respect here? Where do you see that I """"keep"""" an uncivil attitude? Honestly, you are the one being uncivil: """"if you carry on in the line you are takng, you will be blocked again"""" ... which line I am takng? And why do you threaten me? """"If you do not wish to contribute constructively to the encyclopedia, then we shall make sure that you do not prevent others from contributing"""" ... oh, """"we"""". This sounds to me more like a street gang threatening a poor pedestrian, than an admin giving wise advices to a poor Wikipedian. Go to my user page and see the articles I've created. Isn't that a positive contribution?
Look: I am not being uncivil; it is you, the one being disrespectful with me. And I am not ignoring your requests of being civil; I am fulfilling them. And it is rather you, who are not only ignoring my requests of justification for the actions you carried out against me, but also threatening me with new repressive measures.  """,0.14285714285714285

The article states that """"Montenegrin and Serb identities are not exclusive"""", but this is not true. They are exlusive acording to the constitution of Montenegro, the constitutional charter of Serbia and Montenegro, and half a dozen separate censuses since the mid 20th century - all of which allow only one national identity to be declared. These are the raw and unbiased facts (not speculation). On the other hand, it is true that a number of Serbs and Montenegrins may believe that they have both identities - but there is no modern census nor constitutional basis that can support a statement such as """"Montenegrin and Serb identities are not exclusive"""". Many Montenegrins do not feel to be Serb, and never pronounce themselves as such. You can not force national groups to """"be Serb"""" if they do not feel so and never declare as such.

""""However the number of Montenegrins does seem to be in steep decline since the introduction of the category by the Communists on the 1948 census"""" seems to imply that the Communist regime declared the nationality of citizens in polls. This is not true, as citizens declared their nationaility in polls, individually. In fact, the Communists - for the first time allowed citizens to declare their nationality as Montenegrin - by introducing the category, which is more important. If it stands like the previous user wants it to stand, then we must add a sentence stipulating that the """"Serbian ruling dynasties in the pre World War II Yugoslavia banned Montenegrin citizens from declaring their nationality as 'Montenegrin'"""" This is as true as the Communist quirp, as the Montenegrin option was obviously not allowed before World War II.

The article states that MOC was not re-established in 1993, which is a fallacy. The MOC has been legally registered in Montenegro in line with the valid legal system of the state of Montenegro and in line with the laws in Montenegro - which is clearly apparent from the MOC page on Wikipedia. The MOC Church is called the Montenegrin Orthodox Church in its formal registration in Montenegro, so there is no space for speculation here. The Church was re-established after a separate existence until 1920. 
The article does not claim that MOC is a major branch of Eastern Orthodoxy outside Montenegro. 

The statement """"over 74% of Montenegrins are Eastern Orthodox Christians, most of whom belong to the Serb Orthodox Church"""" is anyway a fallacy, as there is no accurate census that can prove this. One may say truthfully say that """"most Montenegrins are Eastern Orthodox Christians, most of whom belong to the Serb Orthodox Church"""", but a large number of Montenegrins are atheists, agnostics, or otherwise, myself included. Being a Montenegrin does not mean that you are part of the 74% of Eastern Orthodox Christians. Sorry, this is the 21st century.

You can not just delete the fact that MOC followers claim that """"all of the existing churches in Montenegro were once part of an autonomous Montenegrin Orthodox Church that was abolished following the union with Serbia in 1918."""" This is the explanation why shrines are not being built en masse in Montenegro by the MOC, as it claims to inherit the churches currently in the hands of SOC. If we put only one viewpoint in """"its following is small to the point of non-existence and it has not been recognised by any other Orthodox Church"""" it is not balanced. Also, the statement """"its following is small to the point of non-existence"""" needs to be based on fact not fancy. Do you have an official census of followers, or is this based on the fact that you are a believer of the SOC?

The sentence """"The validity of the referendum was not confirmed by international observers as the allegedly free and democratic vote, in fact took place during wartime in the former Yugoslavia."""" is true. So I leave it. Of course, I agree to change """"international"""" into """"OSCE, EU and US"""" - as the referendum may have had international monitoring from Cuba, Iraq, North Korea, Byelorussia, and Russia.

First, the dust cover is not a part of the source (it wasn't written by the authors) and is irrelevant and not usable as a reliable source.  A case could be made that the reference made above was to the entire group of adults, and two of the five were unlicensed (the """"therapeutic"""" foster parents), but they are not the subject of the present controversy.

Second, Ponder was licensed, and the fact of her licensure has been verified by the book. Continuing to refer to her as unlicensed is false and should stop.  Ditto with Jeane Newmaker who was also licensed (as a nurse) and was being used during treatment as a """"co-therapist"""".

Third, both on page 28 and 44 of the source, the meaning of Watkins's unlicensed status was discussed and placed into the proper context I described before.  To take the term out of context and describe Watkins simply as unlicensed is to deliberately mislead and misinform the reader; her legal culpability and professional status was much more nuanced than that.  I grant that extensive discussion of the meaning of being """"registered"""" to practice psychotherapy in Colorado would be awkward in an encyclopedia, but if the term is used, then such a discussion should or must take place to properly inform the reader.  It is avoided, however, by not mentioning it out of context, which is what I've been doing by removing the references (which are wrong in the case of Ponder in any case).

Fourth, mentioning the licensure twice (and indisputably erroneously in the case of Ponder) is gilding the lily, especially when I came up with a reasonable solution for the second mention (i.e., using the defendants' surnames) instead of characterizing them.

Fifth, the way is """"unlicensed"""" is used in this article is unjustifiably POV. No justification for inclusion of this characterization has ever been tendered.

=The authority of the user Node_ue in the matter of languages

Mark Williamson also known as Node_ue is a kid of 16 years old. (Born at 1989-08-18, Scottsdale, Arizona, United States [] )

What is the authority and credibility of this kid in the matter of languages? He didn't finished his highschool yet. All other words are useless …

Who is Node? Who is Mark Williamson? Just look at the picture:

Poor little Node having problem with languages! Sic!

I think Mark Williamson known also as """"Node ue"""" is having difficulties  with the words out of his mouth!

Nevertheless the authority of Node_ue is very good presented by himself in [] 

Just take a look the way the Kid Mark looks himself: (Warning! May be in various ways interpreted!) 

Mark is an all-powerful entity made of pure energy. If you know him, you will be blessed and your dreams will come true (or at least they might).

Strengths: All powerful, handsome, smart.

Weaknesses: NONE!!! THE GREAT MARK HAS NO WEAKNESSES! HE IS ALL-POWERFUL!

Special Skills: All-powerfulness, intelligence, &c.;

Weapons: All-powerfulness... sharp teeth... hrm...

All-powerfulness: YES! THE GREAT ENTITY KNOWN AS """"MARK"""" IS ALL-POWERFUL!!! YES!

Of course his ass is so painful….Guess why?!

Node's origin as a faggot (gay)…

[] (where he admits he is a faggot)

""""I've also noticed a few things that are possible hints at his thinking he's homosexual/bisexual but not wanting to admit it to himself:
He lies quite a bit to make himself look more """"masculine"""" (apparently he's the most popular guy in school with the girls, and he has to run quickly if he wants to get away from them), he is always going on about how much more attractive he is than me (according to him, this is because both of his parents are of 100% Jewish ancestry, while I only have 3/8ths [3/4ths of the people on my mother's side]), he goes out of his way to make extremely offensive jokes about homo/bisexuality, he goes out of his way to make it look like he's a homophobe, and at the mention of anything even remotely related to homosexuality he has so much disgust for it that he must show that you could fill a whole encyclopedia with his """"ewws"""" (not really meant seriously, according to him).""""

Depth of focus DOF is a lens optics concept that measures the tolerance of placement of the image plane (the film plane in a camera) in relation to the lens. 
While the phrase depth of focus was historically used, and is sometimes still used, to mean depth of field, in modern times it is more often reserved for the image-side depth. Depth of field is a measurement of depth of acceptable sharpness in the object space, or subject space. Depth of focus, however, is a measurement of how much distance exists behind the lens wherein the film plane will remain sharply in focus. It can be viewed as the flip side of depth of field, occurring on the opposite side of the lens. Where depth of field often can be measured in macroscopic units such as meters and feet, depth of focus is typically measured in microscopic units such as fractions of a millimeter or thousandths of an inch. Since the measurement indicates the tolerance of the film's displacement within the camera, depth of focus is sometimes referred to as """"lens-to-film tolerance.""""""",0.0

Well I had the idea that adding content to wiki was what was expected. I fail to understand the """"pure genius"""" comment other an attempt to be nasty. I may add that his 2 essays on Baudrillard were accepted for publication at the International Journal of Baudrillard Studies: http://www.ubishops.ca/baudrillardstudies/ so your testimony to their worthlessness seems silly and rather petty of you. Yes I created this page and 2 more (Frank Popper and Ebon Fisher) but after this experience there will be no more content supplied by me. There are NO claims of """"global influence"""" - only specific facts concerning all three pages I created for you. If you object to my linking his early work to punk - then remove that reference but please stop your pettiness.

 Rydernechvatal

I think you dodge the issues at hand completely. The issue here is the integrity of the online encyclopedia. To place Nechvatal into the field of collage artists, on par with Matisse, is patently disrespectful to this project. There are thousands of artists who do collage, and very few deserve mention on Wikipedia. My brother is an artist but you won't find me putting him all over Wikipedia! He just doesn't have the stature required. That's not a criticism of his work (or of Nechvatal's), it's a statement about what an encyclopedia is for. May I suggest you build Nechvatal a nice MySpace page?

Similarly, to place a 2 page review on Baudrillard alongside the remarks of Susan Sontag is not helpful either. The point of the encyclopedia is not to list every possible thing connected to Baudrillard (in which case Nechvatal's piece would qualify); the point is to discuss and link things which help introduce and illuminate someone at the scale of an encyclopedia. There are thousands of published articles on Baudrillard and very, very few of them have a place on Wikipedia. The same is true of punk visual art and so on and so forth.

You really don't own up to any of this. This is why the charge of pettiness applies well to you: if you truly took responsibility, you would remove your additions and links yourself, rather than ditching this chore to the community. But that's the basic misunderstanding here: Wikipedia is not about individual promotion, by self by fans or by family, it's about a community of people building knowledge in a collaborative way.Dylanfly 

Nechvatal, as a collagist, is discussed in Brandon Taylor's recent book """"Collage"""" published by Thames & Hudson Ltd, 2006, p. 221. Perhaps your brother is in that book as well? Thus I have nothing to own up to.

For the first citation: He has also exhibited in Paris, Cologne, Alalst, Belgium, Lund and Munich and has participated in museum exhibitions around the world.[citation needed]  see the artists CV here for list of exhibitions : http://www.eyewithwings.net/nechvatal/bio/bio.htm

For your 2nd citation for his work being in the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.[citation needed] see: http://www.msstate.edu/Fineart_Online/Backissues/Vol_15/faf_v15_n04/text/review03.html

For #3: Art historian Donald Kuspit has written in his essay The Matrix of Sensations that Nechvatal's digital painting demonstrates that """"there are more possibilities of freedom in digital art — that is, the """"mental elements"""" are """"free[r] to enter into various combinations"""" and thus to be manipulated — than in architecture, painting and sculpture.""""[citation needed]

see: http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/features/kuspit/kuspit8-5-05.asp which is cited in the reference section

 For #4: Frank Popper states in his book From Technological to Virtual Art that Nechvatal's computer virus work is important to the history of art as it has advanced the use of digital technology and artificial intelligence, while defending and preserving the values of formal painting.[citation needed] see: Frank Popper From Technological to Virtual Art, MIT Press, pp. 120-123

This is also cited in the reference section

Does that help?

On second thought, Max, I just took a look at the history and saw that you posted not only the link that you say you're not defending, but also the link to the material from the white supremacist antisemite, William Pierce. There's no need to keep the link on the page while discussing its merits (although that link has no merits to discuss). Wikipedia's editors know how to look at edit histories. When a link is that egregious and beyond the pale, any responsible editor will remove it until it's existence can be justified. Also, I didn't """"remove an external link """"without cause."""" I explained my cause, both here and in the edit summary. That cause was not a """"claim that it's offensive in some way,"""" but a clear, obvious violation of WP:EL and WP:RS with regard to fringe websites.

However, I've just taken a look at your edit history, and can honestly say that, outside of your edits to this article, I can't see any evidence of an antisemitic agenda on your part, so I'm going to continue to WP:AGF. However, it will be to your advantage to recognize that editors who are accustomed to working on Judaism-related articles have long experience with users who """"just innocently raise the question"""" of whether there might be racist material in the Talmud, or whether there just might be a Jewish conspiracy for world domination, or whether we've fairly portrayed the views of folks who think that The Protocols of the Elders of Zion is a genuine document, and shouldn't we leave the material up while we discuss it? The answer to that question is no, and if my assumption of good faith is justified, you'll have no trouble seeing why.

Again, Max, follow those links and you'll see why neither you, nor I, nor any responsible editor would want them to stay on this article or any other that we had a hand in. I'm honestly not trying to start a feud or a flame war or anything else, and I do wish you the best experience possible on Wikipedia.  """,0.0

I definitely will collect factual statistic data before proposing changes in naming.

As for """"Rus"""" and """"Rosja"""", you mix up two different issues (and this mix adds mess to the subject): a) whether or not actions of North-Russian rulers may be considered as reunification of Rus, and  b) evolution of sounding of word """"Rus"""". These a) and b) are not equal. I will present more facts on these issues, and the discussion of course will be continued. Frankly, I'm a bit concerned that instead of commenting prepositions that I suppose near to be facts, you are discussing where these facts lead.

 Origins

Yes, I'm sure it's possible that the many books and articles on the topic, written by various well-known authors, or found in reputable sources, are, in fact, completely wrong, but you'd have to find other reputable sources to refute them; your own personal concern with the concept is not particularly relevant.  Regarding the definition, it's pretty much the same as it was 3 months ago, and the forumulation which presents it more as perception than fact is in deference both to NPOV, and to various editors (like yourself) who were opposed to the concept that it existed at all.

 Hypocrisy

 Episode naming 

Hi, Cyberia.  There's actually been a lot of discussion about this subject at Wikipedia:Naming conventions (television) and its talk page.  The consensus of most of the editors there is that articles should be disambiguated only when it's necessary — that is, when there's no other article by that name.  This is why, for example, Tigh Me Up, Tigh Me Down was moved to that location from Tigh Me Up, Tigh Me Down (Battlestar Galactica) — there is no other article that could be at that page.  This is in keeping with the general disambiguation guidelines at WP:D, specifically WP:D#Deciding to disambiguate, which says:
Ask yourself: When a reader enters this term and pushes """"Go"""", what article would they most likely be expecting to view as a result? (For example, when someone looks up Joker, would they find information on a comedian? On a card? On Batman's nemesis? On the hit song or album by The Steve Miller Band?) When there is no risk of confusion, do not disambiguate nor add a link to a disambiguation page.
The argument you give (that using parenthetical phrases consistently keeps articles consistent and makes them easier to identify) has been considered in the debate at WT:TV-NC, but most editors felt that the """"consistency"""" was a misleading virtue, since preemptive disambiguation actually makes articles less consistent with the general Wikipedia naming scheme.  And the article itself should provide enough context to identify it.  The category system also unites articles on a similar topic.

The Star Trek precedent is, in my opinion, a bad one; the editors at the Star Trek WikiProject have been informed of the discussion at WT:TV-NC, and it is likely that Star Trek episode articles will also be moved soon.

I admit that Resurrection Ship and Cylon resurrection ship are a slightly complicated case, but I think that since the episode is titled Resurrection Ship (with a capital """"S"""") and the ship itself is at Cylon resurrection ship (with no capitals), it's sufficiently clear.  However, if you and other BSG editors feel that it's better to have Resurrection ship as a disambiguation page, with the episode at Resurrection Ship (Battlestar Galactica episode) and the ship at Cylon resurrection ship, that would be OK too. — (talk • contribs) 

It's been considered.  See the extensive discussion at WT:TV-NC and its archives, especially here. Basically, the argument is that disambiguation isn't about identifying a subject unless there are two articles that might otherwise share the same name.  So it's appropriate for """"The Enemy Within"""" to be disambiguated The Enemy Within (TOS episode), since there are other meanings of The Enemy Within (disambiguation).  But there's no need for Charlie X to be disambiguated, since only the TOS episode has that name. — (talk • contribs)

Please check things out before blowing crap diarrhea out of your mouth. Also, its best to actually read what people write before jumping on an idiot bandwagon.

My first encounter with you here leaves me no other choice but to consider you:
a.) not very civil
b.) a drooling cretin.
c.) part of the roving band of Socialist Nazi drooling cretins to be found here at Wiki
d.) get a life

"I appreciate you are now discussing this topic as opposed to unilaterally undoing edits.  The case of Damas is relevant as this de facto segregation is in effect due to the wider racism inherent in Israeli society. Take away the racism, there would be no more segregation (which applies to Israelis BORN IN ISRAEL of Ethiopian descent who speak perfect Hebrew...not just Ethiopian Israelis). The fact that Beta Israel/Falasha donated blood was thrown out IS an act of segregation (under Jim Crow in the US whites could not receive donated blood from blacks...which is of course scientifically baseless).",0.0

actually, I like the Amtack list because it lets you jump to the wiki city for each destination...
like virtually getting on the train and traveling to the next city using wiki... also, its shows how the city is connected to other cities which is valuable information.. I would never have thought of looking at the other nearby cities without such lists... and these nearby cities are really part of the cities identity in a way since they are so close to each other, so I think they deserve to be here... I don't know why you people are always so narrow minded about new ways of thinking about an encyclopia...90% of what is in wiki would never make it into a real encylopedia...does that mean it should be deleted?  I think it should be judged on its usefulness to real users... not religiously according to the strict definition of encyclopedia from the 19th century...I mean come on, this is the 21 first century people...think outside of the box...

I really don't think its a good idea to move  the content onto a separate child page unless you want to watch  them like a hawk......its been shown time and time again that there are many loser wiki admins that like to make themselves feel big by deleting other people's work or work in progress....in fact that's all these type of admins ever really do on wiki is delete pages...look at their log files if you don't believe me...they especially like to delete the type of child pages that you are suggesting to split this page into because they don't get as much traffic as the main page and are therefore are easier pray for them to deletion due to less real users viewing the page to object to their cheap thrills...if you don't beleive me... try spliting this page and you will quickly see your child pages deleted... also, creating ackward sounding page names like """"Cumberland Maryland's Industrial Legacy's"""" is sure to get deleted just because they will object to the name ...""",0.0

You may also remove the notice if you disagree with the deletion, though in such cases, further discussion may take place at Articles for deletion, and the article may still be deleted if there is a consensus to do so.

Wikipedia has certain standards for inclusion that all articles must meet. Certain types of article must establish the notability of their subject by asserting its importance or significance.

Firstly, The concept of """"state terrorism"""" as it applies to declared war is inherently fringe. The USA and the Empire of Japan were engaged in a declared war. The idea of """"war terrorism"""", as outlined in the article now is a a neologism and shouldn't be included on Wikipedia.

"To believe that early zoom lens designs of the sixties had and optical quality comparable to today's is ridiculous.  This ignores the progress on optical design of the past few decades. Early zoom designs typically consisted of three lens groups (convergent,divergent,convergent); the 2d group was fixed, and the 1st and 3rd groups were mobile.  Furthermore, the 1st and 3rd group were rigidly linked, so that a complex and difficult to manufacture non-linear cam-based group distance regulation mechanism wasn't needed.  The downside of the rigid linking was that such a design can limit optical aberrations only over a very limited focal length range.
The development of sophisticated complex non-linearly driven four-group based designs (focusing, variator, compensator, relay master) is a fairly recent phenomenon that has been enabled by the development of new optical design techniques, computation algorithms, manufacturing — e.g. lower cost aspherical lenses, numerical control machines to manufacture precise non-linear driving cams — and material science — e.g. glasses with anomalous dispersion characteristics.",0.0

"Re: Tryptofish discussion 

I completely agree with your red pill explanation of the problem, and I think you have a good handle on the problem.  But just like in The Matrix, few people could handle going down the rabbit hole. I think Trypto felt like you were attacking him for his arbcom opinion, and he's pretty sensitive about such things.  I think you're correct about Kudpung, but there are several differert ways to make your point without directly attacking Trypto. For example, you could have informed him that according to Kudpung's absurd recall criteria, Trypto is no longer allowed to participate in the recall process. Of course, criticizing Kudpung is like shooting fish in a barrel, so it's not very sporting. This is a guy who claimed, quite unbelievably, that the Wifione case was a good reason to keep the tools bundled and adminship as high a bar as possible in the very face of evidence that showed otherwise.  Wifione was able to get away with mischief for five years precisely because adminship is an elite process that protects and rallies around its own.  If the tools had been debundled, Wifione would have been desysopped at the first sign of trouble.  Trypto probably isn't aware of any of this or Kudpung's hilarious recall page, which is literally designed to prevent anyone from recalling him!  Go read it if you don't believe me.",0.0

Within the medical establishment, a medical student who has not yet received his or her MD is referred to as an """"undergraduate"""", in contrast with residents who've received their MDs but are not yet board-certified.  In that context, a medical student is an """"undergraduate"""" because he or she has not graduated from the MD program.  However, that does not mean that an MD is an """"undergraduate degree"""" as that term is usually understood in the US.  That term is reserved for bachelor degrees; any program (such as medical school or law school) which is generally attained after four-year college is called a """"graduate program"""", and the degrees it grants are """"graduate degrees"""".

My wife's a medical student, and every one of her classmates has a BS or BA. — (talk • contribs)

"List of schedules on ABC/NBC/CBS pages

Wikipedia is NOT a TV guide. These schedules violate WP:NOT, and more specifically Wikipedia is not an electronic program guide. Having general schedules is one thing, but putting in each week's schedule violates the very tenants of Wikipedia. I will be removing them from each of those pages, and if you persist in replacing them, I will take this to administrative arbitration. Please do not make overt threats when I'm specifically citing WP policy for my actions; in addition, the entries I am citing are specifically geared toward the existence of television program guide material. 

A general list of a network's schedule was noted as okay in a previous AfD, but the specifics of the AfD indicate that the type of guide material that I have previously removed are not permitted under WP:NOT.",0.0

4. Accept all Korean language sources you stupid bitch!! How dare you try to stifle and censor articles in the name of your fucked up cult. Your Forestgarden bitch believes its within Wiki policy to include Korean language articles when reporting on favorable aspects of your bitch master. Why don't you include all the other more negative portrayals in the Korean language. Also, who said this Itsahappyday fuckhead deserves to translate any Korean? This should all be disputed, you fucking racist, neo-nazi reject?

The world is """"cynical."""" Those who don't believe in Dahn are """"cynical."""" I can't wait until South Park makes an episode about your bitch cult.

Think about it retard- the fucking nation of Palau has more of a right to talk about religious heritage than the fucking hermit kingdom. How can you be so retarded, that you choose a Korean cult? If you chose a Chinese or Indian one, at least it would show you have some portion of a brain. Coming to Korea and joining a Korean cult with Korea-centric views is more retarded than travelling to Antartica in search of good coffee while visiting Columbia in search of ice and snow.

The statements in the lead are not only non-neutral, they are slanderous:

The first sentence frames the quote """"wanting to play the game too much"""" as a direct quote from the EA spokesperson, which is false. It is nowhere to be found in the original statement; this is in fact Destructoid's interpretation. The second sentence victimizes the users. This does not belong in the article, let alone the Lead. For describing EA's statement, I feel that leaving out a comment on """"players were having such a good time"""" would be better because the phrase is ambiguous. Personally, I see it as PR used to express that the game keeps people happy for long periods of time. Other sources see it more maliciously. It is so open to interpretation that trying to write about it would not be neutral. For the entire description, I would write: """"Senior producer Kip Katsarelis commented that the game servers were consistently at maximum capacity, which has made it difficult for new users to connect.""""

""""At what point does an editor here pass your threshold for what constitutes a non-newbie?"""" As for Delta/Triangle (sorry, I don't know how to make triangles on my keyboard), I concluded at the time that he was a newbie for the reasons I mentioned above. It was an explanation of my perception at the time, and not some type of value judgment. But if you really want an answer to your question, I'd say an editor is no longer a newbie when they have a reasonable command of how Wikipedia works, such that they do not make false accusations of copyright infringement, make a point of communicating with image uploaders, and familiarize themselves with the right way to communicate with members of the community.

""""If you believe images should be retained without there being a rationale for that use present..."""" Thank you for making it clear that you either are not reading my messages, or are being deliberately churlish. I didn't say anything about images being retained without a rationale. I already explained clearly above the matter regarding the rationale, and if you're either too illiterate or too lazy to read and comprehend this, then perhaps you should not engage me in discussion.

I made the edit summary that I thought was appropriate, as I'm quite tired of obnoxious deletionists like Triangle who make false accusations and no attempt to communicate with others, as well as persistent liars like yourself who think repeatedly putting words in other people's mouths constitutes """"discussion"""".

 This is a relatively new website, but pardon if I'm mistaking; Randi Harper is the CEO of OAPI (correct?) This same Randi Harper has been accused of abuse, bullying & harassment by another Online Abuse Prevention Website STGRB - Stop The GR Bullies: Harper organized a revolt to write """"bad reviews"""" of Amazon books by authors Harper didn't like - She contacted Amazon directly through her OAPI website to get several books (from authors she didn't like) pulled from Amazon.

Harper rallied her Twitter followers to publicly attack Rice and write articles in gossip websites bluntly lying that Anne Rice is the harasser.

 Good job UC Bill. Thanks. I submit that all we need to settle out of this ArbCom is whether or not the previous RfC, where the community rejected “son of autoformatting”, was a fair and proper reading of the community consensus. Locke dragged us all to this ArbCom because he said that RfC had been rigged with slanted questions. It appears that you are conceding that, while you back your code, you acknowledge that the community doesn’t want “son of autoformatting”. If that is the case, I think we are done here on ArbCom on that issue.Wikipedia is a hobby; we’re all volunteering our efforts. And I would dislike it a great deal if I worked on something that few Wikipedians wanted. If I were you, I’d solicit input on what exactly the community wants through RfCs of your own. I’d also drop posts on the talk pages of known opponents of “son of autoformatting” (like Tony, Dabomb87, Ohconfucious, and me) in order to get a clear understanding of what the community would really like to receive, and then go to work on that.

I'm arguing for the page to state that Artpop received general positive reviews with a disclaimer afterwards that states that the reception has been more ambivalent than her past works. STATic has been engaged in this debate for months and has admitted twice that he dislikes Lady Gaga and even made fun of her and her fans, which obviously constitutes WP:Bias.

 Warning 

An important messageThis notice has been left for you because another Wikipedia user suspects that, perhaps inadvertently, you may have defamed someone in your contributions. Please recheck your edits. Do not make allegations against someone unless you have provided evidence from a reliable publication, and then make sure you describe the allegations in accordance with our content policies, particularly Wikipedia:Verifiability and Wikipedia:No original research. Don't rely on hearsay, rumours, or things you believe without evidence to be facts, and don't use sources to create a novel narrative. Wikipedia requires reliable sources for all claims. Please see our policy on biographies of living persons.

If you may have inadvertently defamed someone in an article, do two things:
If the material is still there, remove it immediately. You may wish to use an edit summary like """"Removing possible defamation"""" to prevent it from being reverted.
Leave a note via the oversight page saying that you have accidentally included defamatory claims in a named article or articles. Do not repeat the claim(s). The revision(s) containing the material can then be deleted from the page history.

 First point - it was not only treated as mental illness, but as criminal activity.
 Second point - you should only refer to 'homosexual romance' in the lead if there is a section that deals with 'homosexual romance' in the body of the text, as the lead is a summary of what is in the body, and having ten sources does not count for much unless the terms are unpacked somewhere in the main text.  All these seem to show is that people like Giddens (who is a notable sociologist, but no authority on sexuality, sexology,  LGBT studies in general or homosexuality in particular) use the term.  If there were a link to an article Homosexual romance, which shows the term can be taken for granted, fine - otherwise it needs to be dealt with in the article before it can be inserted into the lead. 
 Third point, my earlier comment about this was made with ironic and humorous intent, because I have only come across the term 'romance' used in this context, at conferences, ironically or critically.  Just because a term is used in sources does not mean that it can be used in the lead when it is not in the text, for example, """"Homosexuals deserve to be executed or tortured""""   """,0.14285714285714285

THIS IS MY REPLY TO YOU THAT YOU HAVE DELETED ACTING AS A FASCIST FROM THE DISCUSSION ON NICOSIA PAGE:

Nicosia and discrimination against Greek contributors and the Greek character of the cityDear Salvio,

You have accused me of abusive behaviour against other users and consequently blocked me from editing the article on Nicosia for a 24 hour period.

May I draw to your attention that it is fairly obvious that those three users namely Seb az86556 , Seric2 and Chesdovi are clearly constantly creating a picture of Nicosia as a decadent muslim city that serves their religious beliefs and are all clearly hailing form Turkish backgrounds.

There is a constant undermining of the city´s Greek identity i.e. whenever a Greek flag appears in any single picture the aforementioned users delete that picture instantaneously and prefer to throw in pictures of the flag of """"shame"""" and occupation that is equivalent to a legalisation of a human crime of continuous brutal occupation of the island of Cyprus by the Turkish army.

The Greek flag is OMNIPRESENT in the Republic of Cyprus whether some people like it or detest it but this is the reality and an Encyclopedia that wishes to be UNBIASED should depict the REALITY and not the subjective views of a minority of readers that are furthermore based on extremist religious and nationalistic views. On the other hand, such users do find it appropriate to throw in pictures using the Turkish and the ILLEGAL, yes illegal according to United Nation referendums flat of the non-recognised internationally illegal self-proclaimed state of the so-called TRNC.

It is totally UNACCEPTABLE to have extremist nationalistic individuals, that strategically reached the level of administrators, deteriorating all the time the article on the city of Nicosia, promoting an unrealistic Turkish character and undermining the Greek character of the city AND at the same time having an ADDITIONAL article on """"North Nicosia"""" that is depicting a totally FALSE picture w.r.t the city. The TRNC is illegal, not recognised by any state other than Turkey and some terrorist states that are non-democratic and yet Wikipedia has a page on Northern Nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of Cyprus. This is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on Northern Nicosia stressing how Turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for Nicosia and emphasize the Turkish character of the city, talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the Greek character.

This is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable Greek character of the area controlled by the Republic of Cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the Republic of Cyprus the mere fact that Wikipedia has a site that is CONSTANTLY vandalised by several ethnic Turkish extremists and Wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour.

In the light of all of this, I shall stop contributing to Wikipedia as I consider it downgrading for my own self. Furthermore, I do not wish to participate in an """"encyclopedic"""" project that is totally biased and discriminatory.

I take some exception to what you're saying, Xander, though I agree with it in bulk. While there is artistic licence for an heraldic artist to interpret the blazon broadly, I am not at all familiar with any convention allowing for adding embellishments. Can you please provide a reference for same? I am completely unaware of any convention which allows an heraldic artist to add elements that are not described in the blazon. The arms are the blazon, period, and nothing more or less. Beyond My Ken, perhaps a better way to explain this to you... you think the representation of the arms is what matters, yes? That is not in fact the case. Blazons are much more like recipes; Mrs Fields has a single recipe for e.g. their chocolate chip cookie. That is the important thing. Anyone, possessing the recipe, could make a reasonable facsimile thereof. So there's that.
However, this is all fairly abstruse heraldic knowledge which not a lot of people know, which gives us the problem you are having; you feel that presenting a given cookie as a Mrs Fields cookie is inappropriate unless it was actually made by Mrs Fields. In one sense, you're right, but you're only right out of totally understandable ignorance of how heraldry works. 
All that being said, it is true that there are 'official' coats of arms inasmuch as they are the ones approved for use by the holder of the arms. For example, the representation of the Arms of Canada currently in use has been personally approved by The Queen and is thus 'official' for government use.  
And with all of that being said: the reference in question does not support the adornments added to the image. It supports only the blazon, and any depiction which follows only the blazon is both heraldically correct and properly sourced. →  ₪

I literally have about 17 other accounts that have absolutely nothing to do with """"Vost"""", """"ElliotJoyce"""", or """"Accreditor"""", and I've used those accounts to transform Wikipedia articles to match my tastes, which usually means countering the racist garbage from pseudo-intellectual cancers like you sweety. See, from all of the edits I do, you dumb idiots pick up only a fraction to revert- while I've been keeping you busy with Vost socks (which itself is a sock of another account), I've committed over 200 edits under the radar from special-proxy rotations in the last 4 days. I have 2 admin accounts, 5 non-admin accounts of previously active users which I've since been able to commandeer (more on this later), and about 10 standard self-created accounts. What's even more hilarious is that the reverts engendered by my socks usually cause enough notice to the article that I don't even have to do anything to get my views to dominate: I let other users add fuel to the fire that I started. But you know what the absolute kicker to all of this is? I got you, yes you, you Jew-wannabe, black racist cancer smear, to violate numerous Wikipedia policies and your own Wikipedia philosophy by going after me, vendetta style.

I win, and considering that your power level on Wikipedia is considerably more entrenched than my own, my victory is that much more devastating. The IP I'm using at the moment, courtesy of the 24-hour computer lab in my dorm, is about 1 of thousands of batch IPs I have access to, which gives me even greater security and privilege to spread myself over Wikipedia in case my special proxy rotation is ever categorized as a proxy, and thus blocked. Oh, and regarding the commandeering of accounts: graphical analysis password bypass and deconstruction (GAPBAD) is a rather effective means to obliterate CAPTCHA; its use is only feasible at specific time intervals when security measures on the target fluctuate or do not register properly. Guess which account is getting targeted next as soon as Wikipedia undergoes its next server hash? ). You've been warned in advance. Just remember: I win. You can't do anything to me.

 To be honest, I think that this is a fair comment. Accordingly, (and as this is a much debated article), I would like to propose this revised opening paragraph:
The terms Old Style (or O.S.) and New Style (or N.S.) are used in English language historical studies to indicate that the dating system used in the source material is one or other of the (historic) methods for determining the day on which the year starts. In the Old Style dating, the year began on 25 March, whereas in the New Style it began on 1 January.Death warrant of Charles I web page of the UK National Archives A demonstration of New Style meaning Julian calendar with a start of year adjustment. Additionally (more so in other parts of the world), the terms are used to indicate the change from the historic calendar [for example, the Julian calendar in Europe and the Americas] to the (modern) Gregorian calendar.The October (November) Revolution Britannica encyclopaedia, A demonstration of New Style meaning the Gregorian calendar.Stockton, J.R. Date Miscellany I: The Old and New Styles """"The terms 'Old Style' and 'New Style' are now commonly used for both the 'Start of Year' and 'Leap Year' [(Gregorian calendar)] changes (England & Wales: both in 1752; Scotland: 1600, 1752). I believe that, properly and historically, the 'Styles' really refer only to the 'Start of Year' change (from March 25th to January 1); and that the 'Leap Year'  change should be described as the change from Julian to Gregorian.""""Spathaky, Mike Old Style New Style dates and the change to the Gregorian calendar. """"increasingly parish registers, in addition to a new year heading after 24th March showing, for example '1733', had another heading at the end of the following December indicating '1733/4'. This showed where the New Style 1734 started even though the Old Style 1733 continued until 24th March. .. We as historians have no excuse for creating ambiguity and must keep to the notation described above in one of its forms. It is no good writing simply 20th January 1745, for a reader is left wondering whether we have used the Old or the New Style reckoning. The date should either be written 20th January 1745 O.S. (if indeed it was Old Style) or as 20th January 1745/6. The hyphen (1745-6) is best avoided as it can be interpreted as indicating a period of time.""""

The Tangut did not speak Chinese, they spoke their own language. The official name of their land in their own language has been written about by Ksenia Kepping and is available on a link from the Tangut Language page. In no case was Xia there autonym. It was something like Minyag which is waht they are called in Tibetan. 

In general I have a big chip on my sholder about Sinologists becomming confucian literati. The Yuan, and Qing were no more Chinese than I am. To use Chinese names for these political entities is to take for granted the medieval Chinese worldview. While now it is indeed true that the PRC owns a big chunk of Asia how much of it is actually historically China?

The Jurchen's, Kitans, Tangut, Mongols, Tibetans, Nanchao, Azha (Tüyühün) were their own countries with their own languages and customs. Tangut history is relevant to Chinese history in the way that French history is relevant to English history, but also vice versa. 

To have a thing on the article saying 'this article is part of the section Chinese History' reinforces the view that the Tangut's don't deserve their own history. 

There is a sociological fact about Western academia that Sinology is big and well funded, while Tangutology, Nanchaology, Kitanology etc. are all virtually nonexistant. But this is a fact about us, and not about the history of Central/East Asia.",0.0

{{unblock|DISCLAIMER: I do not identify as a Nazi, Neo-Nazi, Facist, Neo-Fascist. I do not accept or agree with the actions or views of Hitler or any other dictators in the world for that matter. I do not hate Jews... in fact I have many jewish friends...
Hello, although this is technically an unblock appeal, it is really only a reason to explain.... you won't be in a mood to unblock me when I'm finished talking... )
First of all I want to apologise, I should have thought before putting the giant swastika on my page. This is the reason for that... I have a few Jewish friends, and normally we sometimes make jokes about jews and christians and things like that. I never really make jokes about the holocaust, because that never go over well with them and it is not nice... well, apparently, a joke about jews being lawyers set one of my closest friends off who is not really a jew, but claims he is.... now he thinks I am a facist, nazi, and I hate jews.... i gotreally frustrated and annoyed and so I came home and started messing around on my userpage... Second of all, i would like to ask why it is not permissable to """"self identify as a nazi""""? There are several userboxes dealing with this subject. There is even a userbox that states, """"This user identifies as a Hitlerist! WHAT THE HELL?!?!?! You will let people say they support Hitler, but you won't let them say they are nazis?!? Being a nazi does not mean that you condone Hitler or his actions, it simple means that you support the theory of the politics behind Nazism.... you can be a nazi and not support the horrible eugenics policy. But if you are hitlerist, that obviously says you support all that... your arguement would of course be that it is offensive to jews.... well if you are taking that into account, then you should also ban anyone that says they identify as a communist. That can be extremely offensive to christians... if you want me to, I can talk about all the horrible things they did to christians in communist russia (with reference of a nice book). I think I will... one of the things they did was putting shackles on the ankles and wrists of christians with spikes of the inside that cut into your skin if you moved at all... and then they put starved rats into your cell that tried to eat you alive so you had to fight them off while your wrists and ankles are killing you. They also tied you to a cross and hung you upside down over a huge pile of other prisoners crammed into a small room. You were then forced to excrete over everyone. You were also stood upright in a box while they drove long nails into it. It was alright if you stood perfectly still, but you would have to stand there for hours and then your body would sway and poke into the nails. They also stood you naked in a freezer with a doctor nearby that signalled when you were freezing to death and then they would take you out and warm you up. They would do that for hours on end. Then they would beat you over and over again asking you to renounce Christ... the holocaust was horrible, but I would rather be gassed or hung by a nazi than endure those tortures for 18 years like one man who wrote a book about his experiences... so could you ban all communists please? 
My last comment is in response to Chzz's question about me making the 'gay comment' statement. Nowadays the word gay is used for two meanings... one is homosexuality and the other is wierd, stupid, dumb... i was using the second connotation.... maybe if you people didn't spend so much time on this gay... sorry... stupid online encyclopedia you would realize how the real world uses words...
Even if you unblock me (which you won't... )...) I will take a wikibreak... i don't want to become addicted to point of ruining my social life...... i have already recieved a punishment, never becoming an admin (the whole gay... sorry... dumb trust thing)... just know this... i would have enventually removed the swastika after I cooled down and because of your gay... sorry... dumb policy you have lost a serious editor... this whole thing has really annoyed me...

"Firstly, Montanabw, there is no such thing as Equus caballus. That is a domesticated animal. The proper name is Equus ferus caballus - unless domesticated Horses somehow come from Zebras or Asses... Also, there is no consensus that Equus ferus ever set foot on the North American continent, though I personally believe Equus lambei may be a subspecy of Equus ferus. Thirdly, and most importantly, and I hope EVERYONE is listening here when I say this, Equus ferus caballus, the domesticated Horse IS NO MORE native to the North American west than Chihuahuas are to the Canadian tundra. Domestic forms are native NOWHERE. Period. The domestic Horse is RADICALLY different from it's wild ancestor. And Dysmorodrepanis, the reason all the Equine articles are so Horse-centric is because a very large number of vociferous (and outright foolish) people are unhealthily obsessed with horses. Unfortunately, many of these people also think themselves expert enough to declare a domestic animal native to a continent it never inhabited simply because they like to watch them run. Seriously, that's all it is. They like looking at them. It's certainly not an environmental issue. Horses are wildly destructive to their surroundings. They eat more than cattle! And an obscene amount more than the native Pronghorn (which, by the way doesn't trample its food to death like the Mustangs do with they're enormous, heavy-stepping hooves). The only argument the Mustang and Burro worshippers have to use (and they milk it good, let me tell ya) is the similarity of Equus lambei to Equus ferus. But, Equus lambei has not been proven to be synonymous with Equus ferus (though it is a possibility), and even if it were it would be more closely related, by far, to Przewalski's Horse than to Mustangs! E. lambei was tiny! It was like four feet tall at the shoulders! And all the other North American Equids are pretty well-known to not be synonyms with Equus ferus (including E. caballus). Not by a long shot. This is why the Horse Evolution page (and every other page dealing with equines) has been changed back and forth so many times. The people who know what the heck they're talking about try to add useful information and correct blatant lies or grievous mistakes and the people who like pretty ponies go back and try to convince the world that Spanish horses have roamed every continent including Antarctica, Mars and the Sun since before Dinosaurs walked on two feet. I made the ridiculous mistake of trying to add factual information to the Mustang article and, if I remember correctly, it was changed WITHIN THE HOUR. The person doing the changing even removed the scientific names I inserted! The Mustang article has absolutely no indication of what specy the Mustang belongs to now! I swear this endless struggle between the My Little Ponyites and REAL BIOLOGISTS is like the Evolution vs. creationism argument, only dumber. Like I said, these people aren't calling for us to turn our rotweillers loose into the nearest forest, but why not? I mean, it's the same specy as the Gray Wolf. Domestication doesn't matter, if you listen to these people. If that's the case then why aren't we restocking mature Oak forests with farm raised white turkeys? I mean, it's the same specy, after all. Oh. And this is my favourite. Where Wild Asses are actually native they're critically endangered. But I have not read ONE WORD from the Cult of the Mustang and Burro about saving them from ACTUAL extinction, but get this, they want to have the Mustangs and Burros in America declared endangered species.

Leaving out Nelson Mandela and Mother Teresa for a moment, do you mean that you doubt he received recognitions such as this? You seem to be making the point that because you cannot find these recognitions in the press that they are somehow forgeries or myths? Hey, they ain't the Nobel Peace Prize but they are not fake. You seem to be mixing up three issues; 1) whether Hubbard led an extraordinary life and 2) whether he received extraordinary recognition as a humanitarian and 3) how Scientologists generally regard Hubbard. Those issues are not related. I think that even critics will agree that Hubbard led an extraordinary life. And neither 1) nor 2) are really related to his """"personality"""" either. I mean, was/is Mandela a bad husband? Did/does he have a temper? Who knows, you certainly won't find out in our article on him. But if someone decided to write a smear piece on him I am sure that they can find as many people that will say something bad about his """"personality"""" as we see in our Hubbard pieces. Re 3) This is not about my having some """"faith"""" or other, this is about how I have view Hubbard after intimate experience with his creations, Dianetics and Scientology and reading, IDK, millions of his words, and listening to hundreds of hours of lectures. I think that entitles me to have an opinion without getting all mystical and talking """"faith"""". I am sorry that you are getting frustrated but the simple point is that so long as the """"truth"""" about Hubbard as I see it (which, incidentally, factors in the criticisms) does not seem to be in the press then I will feel that what is there is undoubtedly one-sided. You want me to somehow persuade how that what I have come to feel based on a LOT of experience (and extensive research into the criticisms) is """"truer"""" than what some journalist wrote after talking to some few critics?

"""I had a look through the section on theology and came across this: """"There is no original sin in Christian Science, no Trinity, virgin birth, miracles, resurrection or atonement ... no death, heaven or hell, or final judgment."""" Five of the statements are simply wrong. Mary Baker Eddy was an emphatic and orthodox believer in the virgin birth. She certainly believed in the resurrection and the atonement (there is a chapter on """"Atonement and Eucharist"""" in Science and Health). Heaven and hell are defined in the Glossary of the textbook, though they are understood differently in Christian Science than in mainstream Christianity. (It is true that CS does not adhere to the concept of miracles, seeing healing as a result of laws of nature that are not widely understood.) This section is so wrong that it really needs to be corrected in the interest of the accuracy of the article, whatever one might think of CS per se. I don't have time to root out academic sources on this so I suggest that it simply be removed. The over-riding concern is, surely to give an accurate picture of the topic.

Your accusations are false and malicious. You hurl accusations to justify your attempt to enhance POV editing in the article.

To say that rejecting a mediator who had openly expressed a strong bias is wrongful is just more bias on your part. I agree that Wikipedia is not an advocacy site, and that is the exact point I have tried to make.

 Maba Diakhou Bâ 

I first came across the Maba Diakhou Bâ article when I was looking for articles relating to Senegambia.  Having read the view history section of the article, it was evident that it has been on display for quite a few years now.

The purpose of starting this discussion is to disagree with several aspects of the historical account being presented in the Maba Diakhou Bâ article, based on reliable secondary sources as stated in the notablity policy.  Although I have primary documents about the man Maba Diakhou Bâ, I will stick to secondary sources in line with Wiki's policy.  Before I start to put forward my counter argument, I think a brief history is necessary for those who are not well familiar with the subject.  

Maba was a Senegambian jihadist in the 19th century who spent years launching wars against non-Muslim Kingdoms in order to convert them to Islam.  As it will become clearer , you will find out that converting people to Islam was not his only objective for launching jihad.  In any case, he was partly responsible for the mass conversion of the Senegambian people particularly the Wolof people and other tribes in the 19th century.  This is very significant, because Senegambia which encompasses Senegal and The Gambia are predominantly Muslim countries.  The Muslim population are the descendants of those converted in masses in the 19th century many of whom by Maba Diakhou Bâ.  Islam being very strong in both Senegal and The Gambia especially with the advent of the Muslim brotherhoods of Senegal, Maba Diakhou Bâ is given a saint like figure in both Senegal and The Gambia.  As such, no one dares to comment on the atrocities of Maba, his back handed dealings with the French and British administration during the colonial era, his enslavement of people whom he viewed as non-Muslims, his pillaging of lands etc.  Instead, the Muslim majority of Senegambia led by the Muslim brotherhoods of Senegal have fabricated his historical account and pass it off as facts that some historians have fallen for, but of course there are others who will not be duped and have examined the true facts and written it accordingly.  It is very important to point out here that, not all ordinary Senegambian Muslims feel this way.  Many of them try to go about their daily lives with little thought for these kind of things.  There are of course others who take the words of their religious leaders as scripture that is infallible even if ample evidence is presented to them.  In most cases, when I talk about the Senegambian Muslim masses, I am referring to the Senegambian Muslim establishment, who mingle in politics, control what historical or religious programmes are presented in the media etc.  These are the ones who control information and whose desire to is release the type of information they want others to know and believe.   Having said all that, I now address each of the inaccurate accounts presented in Maba's article.  

Maba was killed on the 18th July 1867 at the Battle of Fandane Thiouthiogne commonly known in Senegambian history as
The Battle of Somb. He was killed by the Serer people led by their King Buur Sine Kumba Ndoffene Famak Joof when he thought he could go and launch his jihad against the Serer people as he had done with other non-Muslim tribes and kingdoms.  (Sources: Histoire du Sine-Saloum  by Alioune Sarr, and Essai sur l’histoire du Saloum et du rip by Abdou Bouri Bâ)

The article did not give us the exact date he died and in the """"Death and legacy"""" heading, made a transitional error as to the year he died by putting """"1876"""" instead of """"1867"""". I will also address that section of the article later especially in relation to the first paragraph

In the first paragraph of this article, it says and I quote """"He became leader Almamy in Saloum"""" and under the """"Resistance and Conquest"""" heading,  (in other words resisting French colonialism as noted in the first paragraph of that heading) it states and I quote 
""""While he eventually succeeded in overtaking the dynasty of Saloum, his movement never succeeded in Sine, (Kingdom of Sine) and much of Serer territory remained animist or Christian into the 20th century.""""

First of all, Maba was nothing more than an Almamy in rebellion.  He was not a King with all the powers of a King and him overthrowing the Serer Dynasty of Saloum has not been accurately narrated in this article which I will delve in later.  Note also that in the last paragraph of the first heading, the article talks about how Maba founded Nioro du Rip, but it did not tell us in any part of the article how he founded it, just like in the whole article, important pieces of information has been",0.0

However, due to the fact that I espouse equality and fairness & am opposed to unwarranted victimisation, oppression of minorities, hatred and ignorance it seems that certain users like to think of it as a soapbox to spew their racist, misogynistic, homophobic, xenophobic and hate-filled gibberish....the BNPers, of course, are guilty of all the aforementioned.

Apparently my decision not to allow comments that are basically spam, lazy insults, illiterate ramblings and screeching from morons who don't listen (but just use the channel as their own forum) means I am anti free speech. I don't think our ancestors fought against fascism and for the right for freedom of speech to have hate-filled knuckle draggers abuse that by screeching hate-filled drivel bereft of facts, decency or, indeed, a point.

I do actively encourage freedom of speech for all, quite often letting idiots speak makes them look far more idiotic than I ever could hope. There is a difference between debate and spamming, insulting, not listening and preaching though.

I'm happy to debate, but a debate consists of two sides discussing their views, not one shouting and refusing to listen to anyone else. It is my channel and I have the right not to allow trolls, clones, neo Nazis, racists, haters and all round ne'er do wells the right to puke bile all over it....this is not suppression of freedom of speech and if anyone cares to look back through my channel they will see I actively encourage debate, but also see how so many choose to eschew debate in favour of:
1. Attempting to belittle, hurl abuse and calling me UAF/Marxist/far left/rapist/paedophile with absolutely no basis (libelous in reality).
2. Personal insults, accusing me of being a foreigner, bringing my family into it (they love a """"mum"""" insult) and accusing me of being several users because they can't believe more than one person can disagree.
3. Misquoting, paraphrasing and cherry picking """"research"""" from questionable sources and only ever """"research"""" or accept sources that back up their own beliefs.
4. Lying, accusing me of acts I haven't done and claiming they have """"won"""" the argument when they have ignored the points I raised and just harped on and on.
5. Cloning my account on here and also using my username on far right forums. They have cloned me numerous times.
6. Waffling on about being deprived of freedom of speech (to make insults and allow no right to reply by blocking me from their channels)

Basically, these goons make up a tiny minority of incredibly arrogant, ignorant, spiteful, indecent, amoral, borderline illiterate joy sappers; BNP, EDL, neo Nazis, Islamophobes, extremists, KKK, you name it. THEY are what is wrong with the world and they are what is trying to stop us evolving; their motivation is hatred and ignorance....proven by their labelling of everyone who disagrees with them as communists, UAF, Marxists and Liberals (and more unbelievably fascists?!?) with no basis. Of course, they are just lazy epithets to group the majority into one category when their opposition is made up of a multitude of individuals from left to right, of different coloured skin and beliefs, sexualities, classes, background etc....the majority basically.

Youtube grants these guttersnipes the anonymity to parade their ignorance and disgusting ideals and appear to be a larger group than they are. They are fooling themselves though, they will always be a minority of failures who blame their own failure in life on everyone but themselves. Ironically, our ancestors who fought for every freedom they treasure now are having it spat back in their face with every ill informed, erroneous, indecent and anti educational rant these idiots post.

"I think you don't see what I mean. My concern is not with the content but with the terminology. The word 'basin' has three definitions: a structural/tectonic one, a sedimentary one and a geomorphological one. All three seem in some way to apply to the London Basin (and the exact boundaries of the London Basin may differ depending on the definition!). The word syncline only has one definition, a structural one. The original sentense called an apple a kind of pear. 
I agree with you that the synclinal structure is essential and should be discussed, preferably in the header of the article. But a syncline is in itself not a sedimentary basin. It is a structure on its own. The occurence of a syncline at the core of a basin is, however, usually not accidental. When strata are folded, someone may of course think the synclines will form a basin. In nature though, uplift is never quick enough to create structural basins in this way, certainly not at the scale of the London Basin. Erosion will remove the anticlines and sediments will fill the synclines almost instantly (instantly in geologic time). As folding continues, so will erosion and sedimentation. Eventually a structure will form which is both a structural syncline and a sedimentary basin (a basin in the sense of: a place where sediments have accumulated). This model is called syn-tectonic deposition (or syn-depositional folding). As far as I see, this may well be the case for the London Basin, but I am not sure since we haven't found conclusive information in the sources yet.
There is another way how the strata can be folded into a syncline: pre-tectonic deposition (or post-depositional folding). It is important to find out which of the two models applies. The test will be that in a syntectonic basin, the strata will wedge out in the direction of the edges, while in a pre-tectonic basin, the strata will on average have the same thickness everywhere. The outcrop pattern on the geologic map doesn't show the difference, because the map is not detailed enough.
That the older strata of the Chalk are also folded by the syncline is clear, but I don't see what that has to do with the basin on top of them?",0.0

"Most of us are sympathetic to your personal story, and we understand the importance to you of your relationship with Endal. However, as you have noticed, we have guidelines for what can be included on Wiki. I have been working to make the Endal article conform as closely to those requirements as possible. Dogs that have long pedigrees are not (at the moment, but things may change!) considered to be notable on Wiki. Wiki, however, is quite fluid, and there may be a time when pedigree histories are considered important enough for an entry. The reasoning behind the argument for inclusion of the Endal article on Wiki is not your relationship with the dog, nor its pedigree (it wouldn't matter if Endal was a mongrol), but that there is a considerable amount of media coverage. That the media coverage has been prompted by yourself has caused some alarm, and some questioning of the article - especially as you started the article on Wiki yourself. It just looks like a vanity thing - and we do get a lot of that on Wiki - some people don't quite get that this is an encyclopedia rather than a free home page for whatever they fancy putting on it! However, regardless of who started the article, I feel that the amount of coverage that has been generated by yourself for your dog gives it a certain amount of notability. As you are so close to the subject, there is the question of original research and other Wiki principles that may be broken. I would strongly suggest that you refrain from editing the article until you are more familiar with Wiki procedure - you may just push it into a decision for deletion either now or some point in the future (yes, Endal can be submitted for future considerations for deletion - passing the current discussion does not make it secure!).

Later I noticed that one of the refrences I put may not be permitted because immediately a warning tag came on the article, saying I should use secondary references. That made me to suspect that the reference I picked from the website of Pastor Chris Ojigbani may be the cause of the tag. I put a reference from the ABOUT US of Ojigbani in the space where the article says that he considers his ministry is not a church. So I put that reference because in the ABOUT US, it stated his ministry is not a church. But when I saw the tag, I removed the reference and was able to see an article from a newspaper that states Ojigbani's ministry is not a church. But after changing it, the tag is still on the article. I don't know how to remove it. Kindly help check the article and help remove the tags, if okay.

Military spokesman Lerner said the militants had died when explosives went off in a tunnel that Israel had bombed several days ago, fearing gunmen planned to use it to try and penetrate into Israel."""" It turns out the same account was given by The New York Times: """"When Hamas militants entered the damaged tunnel a day or so later, they apparently set off explosives there...Hamas blamed Israel, escalating the hostilities that grew into the current confrontation.""""

ikipedia Founder Hit With Relationship Trouble, Allegations of Excessive Spending
By Megan McCarthy March 03, 2008 | 3:34:58 PMCategories: People  
Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales didn't have such a good weekend. First the blogosphere and then Wikipedia itself lit up with news of his messy breakup with controversial Canadian TV pundit Rachel Marsden. Now, accusations are flying that Wales has been living the high life on the expense account of the nonprofit foundation he created.
On Friday, reports surfaced that the married-but-divorcing Internet icon carried on a clandestine affair with Marsden.  Evidence of the affair included lurid IM transcripts, which appeared on Silicon Valley gossip blog Valleywag. On Saturday, Wales posted a statement on the Wikipedia Foundations website (which he later moved to his personal site) denying that his actions went against Wikimedia Foundation's policies, and stating that the affair had ended. Marsden responded by listing the clothes that he left at her house up for auction on eBay.
So, what's the big deal when a relationship goes sour? Well, the two met when Marsden contacted Wales to help her """"clean up"""" what she perceived to be errors on her personal Wikipedia page, and there have been allegations that Wales used his influence to improperly make changes.
Former associates of Wales' are using this scandal to bring up other worries they have about the organization of the foundation. Former Wikimedia exec Danny Wool, who left the foundation last year, wrote a blog post insinuating that Wales used the non-profit foundation as his own personal piggy bank. Expenses that Wales tried to apply to the foundation included $300+ bottles of wine and visits to Moscow massage parlors, Wool alleges. According to Wool, the expenses got so out of hand that the Wikimedia foundation took away Wales' corporate credit card.
""""There were occasions where he used [the Wikimedia Foundation] for personal advancement under the guide of the mission.  And, as someone who was in there for the mission part of it, I found that rather distressful,"""" Wool told EPICENTER.

Discography
We should be able to come up with a definitive list of commercially released albums and singles. Let's start with the headings. 

Officially Released
Self Released
Singles
Out of Print Compilations
In Print Compilations

Those should be in sentence case. Do folks agree on those headings? - 

 I think those sound reasonable. I have changed them to sentence case, and re-added the record covers which were deleted from the discography by Jonah. I also re added the descriptions of Rose's musical style that were deleted without explanation. Finally I re-incorporated a new version of the sentence dealing with racism and antisemitism. It makes not direct claims about Rose's online work, only that it deals with race and religion. Then I wrote that this has created a series of accusations of racism and antisemitism in various online chat groups. While online chat groups are not officially a source, the fact remains that these criticisms are out there, posted in various places. I think that this should satisfy both SP (by being NPOV) and Ayers (by bringing up the issue).  Hope this helps. I agree with Will, let's move on.  

I do wonder at the designations of """"self-released"""" vs. """"officially released."""" At what point does one become the other? """"Bone Again"""" and """"Elizabethan Period"""" were funded by people or companies other than Biff, and given professional print runs of a few to several thousand; they were distributed through non-internet indie channels, and reviewed in Mojo magazine.  """"Roast Beef"""" was pressed using Biff's royalties, but then it was picked up by a distributor who slapped their own record label's sticker on the cover; several thousand were produced and sold.  """"Hamburger Blues"""" was an """"official"""" release that may have been a smaller print run than some of Biff's website releases.  """"Uncle Jesus"""" was a major label album that is harder to find than """"Roast Beef."""" """"The Pickwick album was an """"offical"""" compilation of far seedier origin than some of the indie releases.  The whole issue of """"in print"""" vs. """"out of print"""" is a bit difficult to assess as well.  If copies are sealed, stockpiled and available, isn't the album still """"in print""""?

My concern with these categories is that they tend to appear at the same times that text changes are made diminishing Biff's accomplishments; and they seem to be included as part of the intent of that effort.  If you look at other artists' discographies, these distinctions are rarely made.  For example, see Sun_Ra.  A great many of Sun Ra's albums were self-released, including most of the artistic milestones.  It is a vague and misleading designation.  Why not go for straight chronology?

And to confirm Marcuse's interpretation, I was not implying that Marcuse initiated a given edit.  Is someone trying to start fights where they ain't?   

The problem here is that you wrote something, a line that went unsingned, but on closer inspection was found to be added by you but attributed by you to someone esle. You then followed this by saying that you agreed with the line. Very unwiki of you.

Indeed, someone is trying to start fights where they ain't.   

 Wallawe/Jonah, I'm curious what the """"released on cdr"""" that you keep adding to the discography means? What is cdr? As far as the self vs. officially why don't we just simply put """"Full length releases"""" and combine them?  

In most of these cases """"cdr"""" is not an accurate designation.  Some of them were glass-mastered CDs.  But as I said above, I don't think that's too important, anyway.  

, you claimed to revert back to Marcuse, but you did not.  That's a super-misleading tag.  

And now I understand what you are referring to:  .  That's something I do a lot.  It's called """"Paragraphs.""""  Here, I'll do one right now.  Here goes....

Actually, I am pretty sure for example Maris Verpakovskis real name is like that, because """"Maris"""" is even Latvian name. At least here in Lithuanian there are both Russians who uses their names as they'd use in Russia and who uses lituanised versions (with endings """"as"""" or """"is""""). Out of Russians who uses lituanised names, many are second or third generation; sometimes parents decides to give children lituanised version of name and surname in those cases, it happens especially in mixed families. E.g. one of Lithuanian football team players is Igoris Morinas; it would be wrong to change it to Igor Morin because Igoris Morinas is his real name. While, for example, real name of the mentioned poolitician is Viktor Uspaskich, not Viktoras Uspaskichas, therefore Viktor Uspaskich is and should be used (and is used that way in Lithuanian wikipedia too). As for Latvian football team, I am not really sure though, but I am sure that for example Verpakovskis is not Mariy Verpakovskiy or something. Maybe someone could shed more light on Latvian policy on names, maybe in Latvia it is different than here in Lithuania, or maybe Latvianisation of name is for example required to get citizenship?

"Are you there? This needs your URGENT attention Sue Anne. Cmon, surely you should ACT atleast this time.

Hi,

Are you there Sue Anne? This needs your urgent attention.

Apropos my earlier message to you, I removed the pathetic PA from Royboycrashfan 's talk page and warned Crossmr against the PA along with a fair note. Please do read that note.

But he removed my first warning and also reverted back the pathetic PA comment on roy's user page ALONG WITH pathetic PA's AGAIN, in both edit summaries.

I gave him a final warning as he repeatedly violated NPA and would not cease and desist.

Yet he continued with his same unacceptable behaviour.

The edit histories of the talk pages of User_talk:Royboycrashfan and User_talk:Crossmr will make this very clear. He keeps deleting and reverting along with PA's in the edit summary inspite of being EXPLICITLY warned.

This is totally unacceptable. Please do take immediate action.

You know me, atleast a little. There is no way anyone can get away with calling me a vandal. You know I am not here to vandalize, but I have contributed meaningfully to a few articles whatever little time I have been on here.

Of course, there were a few misinformed civil issues along the way (which served to inform me about the policy on civility, NPA etc.), but after the block and blowing off a little steam, my behaviour has been perfectly good as can be expected of any genuine user.

even Vesther for that matter with whom I had a little argument would not call me a vandal.

Also there is another admin Nearly Headless Nick who has appreciated my edits to a certain page. 
Also have made a few edits to other articles the few times i was on.

But surely just because anyone is a very occasional user, that CANNOT be used as an excuse for letting anyone get away with PAs.

Also, NPA specifically states that earlier misinformed mistakes and behaviour CANNOT be used as an EXCUSE for a PA. 
If people kept harping on about old issues, it would become acceptable to attack anyone as everyone makes mistakes in the past.

Crossmr  just CANNOT be allowed to get away with his unacceptable MALICIOUS behaviour.

Please BLOCK him symbolically for whatever time you feel is right, to mainly PREVENT him and later forbid him from:

1. Reverting the pathetic PA on Roy's page along with the pathetic PA edit summaries.

2. Removing my very first warning message with a very civil note. I dont care about the second warning, but the first warning serves as a placeholder for record's sake.

Even after EXPLICIT and SPECIFIC warnings not to continue, he continued with his unacceptable behaviour and BLATANTLY violated NPA that too in edit summaries.
Even after being explicitly advised to assume good faith (AGF), he has failed to do so.

Cmon, for whatever you think of me (ur earlier silence), you KNOW I am not a vandal.

Please take appropriate steps as a fair and upright ADMIN.

I am logging off now, other stuff to do. Will log on tomorrow.

I do hope and expect you to symbolically block Crossmr, which will prevent him from continuing to behave unacceptably as he has blatantly violated NPA even after being repeatedly warned about it.

It's a good suggestion. I would go a little further and offer this version of the entire paragraph that circumvents any mentioning of the 'claims':

""""Although the empire had a multi-ethnic character during its history and preserved Romano-Hellenistic traditions, it became known to most of its western and northern contemporaries as the Empire of the Greeks due to the increasing predominance of the Greek element. The use of the term Empire of the Greeks (Latin: Imperium Graecorum) to refer to the Eastern Roman Empire also implied that in the West it was no longer seen as the Roman Empire. The authority of the Byzantine Emperor as successor of Roman Emperors, was challenged by the coronation of Charlemagne as Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Leo III in the year 800. Needing Charlemagne's support in his struggle against his enemies in Rome, Leo used the lack of a male occupant of the throne of the Eastern Roman Empire at the time to claim that it was vacant and that he could therefore crown a new Emperor himself. Whenever the Popes or the rulers of the West made use of the name Roman  to refer to the eastern Roman Emperors, they preferred the term Imperator Romaniæ instead of Imperator Romanorum, a title that Westerners maintained applied only to Charlemagne and his successors.""""

I'd leave the last sentence though since it demonstrates that there was still a certain ambiguity about how Popes and other western rules saw the Byzantine Empire.  """,0.0

Responses:
I have made no """"legal threat"""" to anyone. It is a matter of an apparent breach  of a moral obligation by Sven Manguard to me. I worked hard with Wikimedia Australia over a three-month period to develop an idea in great detail, which is complex and has many original elements. I conveyed some of the details to Manguard after he assured me he had no intention of developing anything remotely similar. I was then told by a third party that """"Sven grabbed me on IRC to tell me he is planning a similar project"""" and that Sven had said """"well, I'm going ahead with it"""". Manguard has since said on my talk page, """"you missed your chance, your partnership fell through, and if there is even the slightest chance of it coming to fruition, it's not going to be for several more months. I'm not going to drop my efforts, and I'm not going to wait indefinitely for something that at this point I'm pretty sure is never going to happen ..."""". Actually, the partnering institution had already agreed in principle, and there has simply been a delay in implementation. I have been led to believe that others in the WMF have been apprised of the idea; but I'm in the dark as to what level of detail he has divulged, and whether clearly identifiable details of my scheme have been or will be duplicated without attribution. If distinctive and original details are being conveyed contrary to his undertaking to me, it is a moral breach; and if they are implemented without attribution to me, that is also a moral breach; if this occurs, I believe I have a moral right to inform people of it. This is the gist of what I said to Manguard, but now I'm been accused of making """"legal threats""""; this is based on a complete misunderstanding. In fact, I don't have a legal foot to stand on in that respect, and he knows it. Why is this being construed as anything """"legal""""? For all we know, Manguard's ideas might be quite different; but he needs to communicate them as a courtesy as much as a practicality.I was the person who suggested publicly that Manguard and Adam be """"directors"""" at FSC, only a few weeks ago. I believe Manguard has done good work there, so I don't understand why this spin-out is happening. It has quickly morphed into accusations of """"gross incivility, threats of off-wiki harassment, and personal attacks"""". I see no evidence of gross incivility by me (aside from an unkind thing I said on his talk page yesterday—""""not mature enough""""—which I'm willing to withdraw), nor of personal attacks. Instead, I have endured major and repeated personal attacks on his and my talk pages. No one has mentioned those.This seems to have been mixed up with complaints about my reviewing at FSC: they are surely two different issues. If people are troubled by professional reviews of soundfiles, I think there's a big problem for features sounds. I have presented factual evidence and what I believe are balanced opinions, and have supported a few WP-produced files, too. I encourage WPians to present their own performances for FS promotion, just as our photographers do at FSC, but please let's review them professionally without fear or favour.  (talk) """,0.0

"""Danny you said above about my complaint of POV scriptures inserted: """"In one comment he claims it's POV to use scripture to validate JW beliefs then in the next he says they don't support those beliefs! Which is it?"""" It's both Danny! They are not mutually exclusive. You have inserted a plethora of scriptures to try and validate JWs' doctrines. You and others are well aware that the vast majority of Bible scholars do not agree with that use of the Bible and they say it's misused, and misquoted over and over by JWs. That is why scriptures should not be there. 1. The Bible does not back up JW doctrine, so it is not a valid reference, and 2. It should not be misused (as it is now) to manipulate the public into thinking that the Bible validates JWs' teachings. These many, many scriptures have only been inserted to try and influence the readers; they are not there for any valid reference, or a back-up to JW doctrine, they are just propaganda.

If they are to stay, then you, or someone, should put an equal link to discussions that state these JWs' doctrines are not majority scripture based, and there are plenty of sites to choose from. Balance is the key, if there are to be many misused POV scriptures over and over again, row after row, then there has to be for balance an equal number of links to scholarly discussion contradicting JWs interpretation of those scriptures, and how they in the vast majority do not back up JWs doctrine. At the moment, Danny, you are trying to turn this entire article into a Watchtower magazine, packed with misquoted scriptures and no discussion making any proven point that these scriptures are backing up JWs' doctrines. Just the usual dump a scripture and run routine, it's not acceptable Danny, you may think any form of propaganda is ok as your religion teaches that, but keep it in your own magazines, please don't infect a public domain with it (I'm sure this will fall on deaf ears).

You made another comment """"Either way, it isn't a point of view, but an indisputable fact that JWs use the Bible as the primary source of their doctrines and beliefs."""" Come on Danny, you know your comment is highly incorrect and very deceitful. Take a look at their predictions, where are they in the Bible, didn't Russell have a fetish for pyramids and made predictions based on their measurements? 

1. demonstrate where 1899, 1874, 1878, 1914, 1918, 1925, 1975 etc, are """"an indisputable fact that JWs use the Bible as the primary source of their doctrines and beliefs""""?
2. Or Where does the Bible divide 'major and minor' blood parts, and say one is ok, and the other a grave sin? I can't find that in my Bible, can you show me please? Or plasma is a sin, but breaking it down is ok, or that red blood cells are a sin to use, but using the 99% haemoglobin in them is ok? Or that animal blood is a sin, but processing cows blood into products is and using them is ok? You get the picture Danny, and there are pages and pages more that scholars agree have no basis in the Holy Bible are all. Please refrain from making silly emotional claims that will end up with egg on your face.

You say more: """"While many disagree with JW interpretation of the Bible, it is important that WP readers see how JWs use scriptures"""", except Danny, they do not see that, there are no justifying explanations, just a scriptures dropped in, and then run along to the next one before they have time to think. For each scripture, there should also be a link to a scholarly discussion that is contrary to JWs interpretation to give a rounded balance of coverage, if you oppose this, you have proven your motives are not pure, but agenda seeking for religious promotion, not balanced articles in a public domain, thus proving that these inserted scriptures are POV and should not be there. Why can't a belief just be """"they believe x, y, z.""""? You are not discussing scriptures and there is not room on Wikipedia for that, so why try and manipulate by dropping them in controversially, and then running away with no justification for they reference?  8th of September 2005

 Sepp Blatter accusations

""""Sepp Blatter believes he would still be in charge of world football if he had succeeded with a 'secret plan to award the World Cup to the US'.

The 79-year-old blamed American and Swiss authorities for forcing him to give up power by arresting several senior Fifa officials and threatening to prosecute Fifa as a mafia organisation.

The US had decided to pursue Fifa, he claimed, after it was beaten in the race for the 2022 World Cup by Qatar.

“It took a political dimension,” he said. “I am looking now to see what were the political reasons. The easiest thing would be to say [they are] bad losers.”""",0.0

"""::*Reverts back to old original profile* I have had a think about this since my last comment: Your assumption is that any editor that tries to enter an opposite viewpoint to that of TM is somehow also being """"disruptive"""" and “difficult”. This is far from the case although this is how it might seem without deep analysis. Looking at the last 2 days for example, myself and other (what you might describe as anti POV editors) have – following discussion allowed two “pro TM edits to be allowed back into the article despite the fact they may not be “resource compliant or NPOV (See for example Orm Johnson on “cults” where I made the revert!) Also notice that”anti” editors have disagreed over the wording of so called “anti TM” sources meaning that they became more neutral in tone (see physiology section.). However, this has not been the case with other “pro” editors”. What this means is that another editors – even neutral ones – come across as seeming otherwise 

Where different points of view exists this must be cited in the article – this is the nature of an encyclopaedia and has been since the first one complied in the Enlightenment. You are also correct that other factors of the Tm organisation do indeed need discussion; however, to me the most important is the research. This is because, reading this article, one would assume that there is a general consensus in the scientific community that TM meditation – or indeed any meditation –has large and demonstrate health benefits including, increasing your life expectancy, curing cancer, and prevent coronary disease! However this is clearly not the case. I understand that as webmaster to NSR  (and thank you for the honesty of at least adding this to your profile) this maybe difficult to believe as your much cheaper form of mediation relies on the research of TM to promote it – but the research that supports such findings is blatant nonsense and no such agreement exits within the scientific community. This needs to be highlighted I am afraid. However the TM organisation will try anything to deny this. .

"Appalling. 'F' for Fail ==

As it now stands, this article is grossly inadequate and misleading. The 'development' at the centre of a sonata structure is in reality a 'Durchführung'  i.e. a 'leading through' various keys. The word 'development' is a poor translation of this  and has generated a situation in which foolish people analyse a stretch of music not according to what happens in it, but in terms of what this wrong word happens to make them think of. As every German muscologist and textbook knows, the point of a 'development section' is *not* various varietites of 'thematic modification'  it is *tonal and harmonic instability* after the stability of the second-subject key and before the restoration of the tonic. Has no-one actually bothered to listen to what does   and doesn't  happen in the included extract...?!? IT'S MODULATORY, AND THAT'S ALL. 

This article is too deeply confused to be rescued. It should just be deleted. Hell, it doesn't have a single worthwhile source... or any idea about the original German terminology...  Pathetic...

Hello ChrisScorsese88, and welcome to Wikipedia. Your addition to List of Jessie episodes has had to be removed, as it appears to have added copyrighted material without permission from the copyright holder. While we appreciate your contributing to Wikipedia, there are certain things you must keep in mind about using information from your sources to avoid copyright or plagiarism issues here.

You can only copy/translate a small amount of a source, and you must mark what you take as a direct quotation with double quotation marks ("""") and a cited source. You can read about this at Wikipedia:Non-free content in the sections on """"text"""". See also Wikipedia:Referencing for beginners, for how to cite sources here.
Aside from limited quotation, you must put all information in your own words and structure, in proper paraphrase. Following the source's words too closely can create copyright problems, so it is not permitted here; see Wikipedia:Close paraphrasing. (There is a college-level introduction to paraphrase, with examples, hosted by the Online Writing Lab of Purdue.) Even when using your own words, you are still, however, asked to cite your sources to verify information and to demonstrate that the content is not original research. 
Our primary policy on using copyrighted content is Wikipedia:Copyrights. You may also want to review Wikipedia:Copy-paste. 
In very rare cases (that is, for sources that are public domain or compatibly licensed), it may be possible to include greater portions of a source text. However, please seek help at the help desk before adding such content to the article. 99.9% of sources may not be added in this way, so it is necessary to seek confirmation first. If you do confirm that a source is public domain or compatibly licensed, you will still need to provide full attribution; see Wikipedia:Plagiarism for the steps you need to follow.
Also note that Wikipedia articles may not be copied without attribution. If you want to copy from another Wikipedia project or article, you can, but please follow the steps in Wikipedia:Copying within Wikipedia.

It's very important that contributors understand and follow these practices, as policy requires that people who persistently do not must be blocked from editing. If you have any questions about this, you are welcome to leave me a message on my talk page.  Thank you.    """,0.0

Image Tagging Image:Rome.gif 

 This media may be deleted.

Thanks for uploading Image:Rome.gif . I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the copyright status is unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then there needs to be an argument why we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then it needs to be specified where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.

If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the  tag can be used to release it under the GFDL. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, consider reading fair use, and then use a tag such as  or one of the other tags listed at Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use.  See Wikipedia:Image copyright tags for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.

If you have uploaded other media, consider checking that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the """"my contributions"""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"Image"""" from the dropdown box.

Reverting vandalism is much easier than debating though, which is why I've assisted in maintaining the page. The biggest problem is that the definition of main event varies. For example, why is Chavo/Kane from WM24, a match never promoted by the company as a main event, listed, but not Flair/Michaels from the same show, which the company considered making the actual main event (and, indeed, several WWE folks said afterwards that it should have). Other examples exist. Why Kane/Undertaker from WMXX, but not Undertaker/Michaels from WM25, another match which was heavily promoted and considered for the final match on the show? (Presumably, it's because someone around here is a Kane fan) Because of these (and other) inconsistancies, we should limit it the actual final match on the card.  0422

 Self Contradictory and Unsourced 

The fundamental premise of this article is self-contradictory.

To summarize the definition given here: 

A """"hate group"""" is a group of people with an ideology that expresses opposition to other people with a particular characteristic, practice or belief system.

People who define """"hate groups"""" as ethically bad and which should be opposed or suppressed, are themselves a """"hate group"""", since by their own definition they are opposed to groups of people with a certain ideology, and often advocate government suppression of hate groups via the criminal code.

The recent coining and popularization of the term """"hate group"""" is a propaganda device using """"highly charged words"""" used by one ideological group to demonize a group holding an opposite ideology.  

Note, for example the Anti Defamation League mentioned on this page.  ADL is a group dedicated to the defense of Jewish people and culture, and has often worked to pass laws to suppress anti-Jewish ideological groups.  Arab and Muslim groups, on the other hand, refer to the ADL as a """"hate group"""" while themselves advocating the abolition of the State of Israel, etc.

Additionally the definition of hate group used here is not sourced.

In the pursuit of NPOV, it would be better to write this article about the use of the term """"hate groups"""" as a propaganda device, rather than allow Wikipedia to become a conduit of such propaganda.69.19.14.35  """,0.0

To repeat what I'd already said at ANI, I am not alleging a topic ban breach, except perhaps under the """"broadly construed"""" wording. I am stating that, based on the manner of this series of reverts on The Automobile Association , followed by this 'rewrite', and based on the fact that HighKing has yet to make any associated comment at Talk:The Automobile Association, instead choosing to treat this as an issue of """"vandalism"""", HighKing has inarguably ignored the warnings Cailil gave him when he re-enacted the BI topic ban about his future conduct. Those can still be seen on his own talk page under the """"Removals of the term British Isles (again)"""" section on HighKing's talk page, so he has no excuse for not remembering them. You're going to have to read that whole thread to get the picture, but it shows quite clearly that Cailil was quite explicit in what he expected from HighKing going forward, in addition to simply adhering to the topic ban: he must stop edit warring and start discussing, he must stop this behaviour of policing terminology on Wikipedia, he must stop introducing (and maintaining by reverts) innacuracies (his altered version of the quote is not in the source, so is clearly innacurate). Basically, he was telling him to just go and find something completely different to do than this, because it is of no benefit to the project. What he has done instead, is just transfer his focus from policing usage of the term 'British Isles' on Wikipeda, to policing the term 'Republic of Ireland', while mainaining the same bad behaviours - edit warring, lack of discussion, misrepresentation of sources, misuse of guidelines/policy, etc, etc. As an administrator, the onus is on you to step in and stop it. Five years is long enough to be still getting away with this sort of WP:TE in the way you have so far allowed him to in this case. You need to block HighKing now until he gives cast iron assurances he understands why Cailil wrote those things on his talk page, and tells you precisely how he proposes to avoid it in future. That's it. As far as evidence goes, short of me pulling out direct quotes of what Cailil said to HighKing, I don't see what more you need to see, to do what is required of you.   """,0.0

It seems obvious that the four constitutent parts are getting more than their fair share of the attention in this article.

Then it says that, historically, other divisions (county, parish, not to mention districts that succeeded the ecclesiastical districts, then ward and constituency) have been the subnational divisions.  It is anybody’s guess whether he latter are official divisions, relatively more official divisions than the vernacular ones of the 4 countries, or co-existing divisions with the 4 countries in the multiplistic complex arrangement that is the UK.  Moreover, despite the statement that there is """"no common stratum of administrative unit encompassing the United Kingdom"""", the structure of 4 (Scotland, England, NI, and Wales) is used as just such a common stratum to describe local government and to structure the article.

"Your actions against Eddiebo
GO FUCK YOURSELF DUMB CUNT, now that is grossly incivil when said towards a person, which I haven't yet, so don't block me (because I know you will). Occasionally putting the worlds most versitial word 'fuck' in a sentence isn't incivil it's just stressing a point. About Eddieebo's death threat to someone, I read that, you are one dumb cunt, seriously, you are fucking stupid. That was not a death threat, there are death threats and death threats, this is the former, where it says kill but everyone should know no-one is serious about it. Maybe wikipedia should wake up to themselves, unblock Eddieebo's account, he has made some useful contributions, sure he swears a lot while talking, but thats because people like you shit him up the wall to no end. Left-wing hippies who are all about the people except when that person is right of Ghengis Khan, like Eddieebo. Well done dickhead, now I know you'll block this account, if you do you'll just prove my point. Just like the stupid muslims who violently protested the comics depicting them as violent, you guys are that stupid. Have fun blocking my account numbnuts. I know you won't listen either, you only listen to things that support your way of thinking, you'll read this, find they way it violates the rules and block me, you won't actually take anything in to that blockhead of yours. People like you think your doing the world justice, but your really just fucking up free speech. He Eddieebo actually read and understood what you and others told him then structured his arguments around them and guess what, he shat on you, seriously, Eddiebo completely ripped you a new arsehole, so you chose not to listen and block him because he put the word 'fuck' in a few places and wouldn't apologise for the death threat which wasn't really a death threat. You do know those are the actions of people who know they are wrong but can't admit it, hey I reckon eddieebo and i can admit where we are wrong, unfortunately you can't, so you abuse justice. Are you in a Western Country? If so you are actually meant to hear both sides of arguments and have a structured debate with a fair judge finally making a ruling before any punishments are imposed, I don't think any of that happened.",0.42857142857142855

"The marvels and mysteries of cite web 

Hei, 
Sorry I didn’t respond earlier. Was through all the material on using  and the time got away. Only had time to run a quick experiment with ‘’cite webb’’ before going out to meet Herr Professor Omberg for breakfast, and then on to do what must be done for the day. But, now that there is time to write, this is what I understand: 

 Using the cite web template assures one adds a fair bit of relevant information so that the reference is more consistent 

 And apparently someone amongst our wikipedia friends “rides a robot” to identify new “cite web” templates and makes sure that they go into WebCite to request a permanent archive. 

Somehow – should the link rot, as it undoubtedly will sooner of later – someone will know how to retrieve the reference from WebCite and repoint the reference so it is still live 

If this is a correct understanding, then using  is a virtuous thing to do and I will do it. For this insight, thank you!

""" Bad crap ==

What bunch of crazies wanted connection to the Force to be mystical instead of genetic? Movies like these shouldn't be mystical! It's about the happenings in a fictional galaxy, not some weird spiritual garbage! The only time it should be spiritual is if it were referencing Christianity, and referencing it correctly at that!  01:48, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I, for one, am an atheist and don't believe in all that spiritual crap myself. However, I think that mysticism in stories makes them much, well… better. It also enhances the theme.   02:24, Jun 9, 2005 (UTC)

How does it do that?  15:26, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Scorpionman, what makes you think that a movie should only be spiritual if it references Christianity and not another religion? —  দ 07:34, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I suppose that depends on your point of view. I'm not relativistic, but when it comes to things like science fiction, there's no need for spiritual stuff.  15:26, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)

In fact, I was disappointed when I learned that the Jedi use some mystical substance that can't be measured scientifically. It would make more sense for me if they were just highly-trained concentrated people. -  14:21, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)

The Jedi don't really use the midi-clorians. The midi-clorians just connect them to the Force, and the Force is what the Jedi use.   23:04, Jun 20, 2005 (UTC)
By """"some mystical substance that can't be measured scientifically"""" I mean the Force. I'm quite disappointed by its very existence in Star Wars. -  06:46, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I don't really think it needs to reference ANY religion. Science fiction is science fiction! If you think it needs to reference Islam, that's your opinion.  03:30, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I don't think he ever mentioned Islam.   00:14, Jun 23, 2005 (UTC)

I am not sure to whom the anonymous editor was referring (I don't see any reference to Islam either), and I suppose this discussion isn't really relevant here anyway. But for the record, I have no problem with spirituality without reference to a specific or already-existing religion, especially in something like Star Wars where the connection of the """"humans"""" to us is obscure (since it takes place during ancient times in a distant galaxy). I was responding to Scorpionman's odd (in my opinion) comment that movies should only be spiritual if they reference Christianity instead of other religions. I personally think it's better to stay away from specific religions. —  দ 02:00, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I really would rather have it not reference spirituality, but my """"weird comment"""" stating that it should only reference Christianity is my point of view. I know not everybody agrees, but I really would rather it all be purely technological and scientific.  01:55, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)

The Force is a power that can not easily be conceived, my young padawan. We must learn to harness its energies, let it flow through us. Only then can we become one with the Force.   02:13, Jun 24, 2005 (UTC)

 Further on Amdo 

Hi, I appreciate your additions to the History section in Amdo. However, regarding the latest addition: """"According to [[Tibetan Government in Exile]], [[Chogyal Phagpa]], the head of the [[Sakyapa]] school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], became the religious instructor of Kublai Khan. In exchange, Chogyal Phagpa received the support of Kublai Khan and assumed political power over the three provinces or cholkas of Tibet.[http://www.tibet.com/status/3kings.html The Three Dharma Kings of Tibet] This intereaction called priest-patron (in [[tibetan]] chöyön) relation was the first in history of Tibet and was also developped under afterward circonstances[[Tibetan sovereignty debate]]."""" I wanted to query two things.

First, the Amdo article is about the Amdo region, not Tibet, and not the """"sovereignty debate"""". While I can see how the relations with the Mongols can be relevant, since the Mongols first incorporated Amdo into other commandaries/provinces, I don't think we need too much detail on the relations between the Mongols and Tibet - that is dealt with in other articles. Furthermore, it is bad form to use internal reference: i.e. another Wikipedia article cannot be used as a reference. Finally, this statement presents only one point of view when clearly there are several. I don't want the History section of Amdo to turn into a rehash of either History of Tibet or Tibet sovereignty debate.

I propose to cut the added paragraph to """", a relationship which the Tibetan Government-in-Exile now terms a """"patron-priest relationship"""" whereby Tibet exchanged political control for the power of religious instruction of the Khans.[ref]"""".

 The various local government areas pages only list them.  I was thinking something like that.  These three paragraphs are from a couple of papers I wrote, they can be incorporated into the article.  

The states (and territories) run the majority of the government in Australia and devolve some of this power down to local government, local councils.  Because this devolution of power happens on a state by state basis, in different states, the local councils have different powers.  Though generally they provide water, sewerage and look after local roads, with the states looking after health, education, police and so on.

Tasmania, like the other states, has a constitution.  Unlike the Australian constitution the Tasmanian one is simply an act of parliament, as such to change it requires no more then a majority in the parliament, not a referendum.  This constitution (among other things) establishes local government in Part """"IVA - Local Government"""" (Tasmanian Constitution).  However, this part while establishing the fact that councils will exist, leaves open how they are operated and what their powers are.  Both the system and power of the councils being provided by the """"Parliament ... from time to time"""" (Tasmanian Constitution).  It is the """"Local Government Act 1993"""" (referred hereafter to as either the 'LGA' or 'the act') that currently provides for the creation of the various councils, the role of the councillors, what power the councils have and so on.  

The act requires that the various councils """"provide for the health, safety and welfare of the community"""", """"represent and promote the interests of the community"""", and """"provide for the peace, order and good government of the municipal area"""".  Generally the act permits councils to """"do anything necessary or convenient to perform its functions either within or outside its municipal area"""".  Specifically, the act provides for the various councils to have the following powers (among others): to charge land rates, """"service rates"""", special rates and to levy fines (in relation to by-laws); and, to make by-laws in respect to anything the council has power to do.

Some which are outdated may not even exist anymore, or they have been revised to include new data. That's the proper way to do things. If QW were to trumpet new knowledge too  quickly, they would often end up having to backtrack, because most new knowledge ends up being a false lead that proves to be a disappointment.

Thank you for reviewing the request. Well, the report is rather motivated by 's highly uncivil threats and bad assumption, so I re-acknowledge of the 3RR rule here. (maybe ANI is a better place to report his rudeness) His first revert did happen several days ago without rationale for his removal of the part. After his revert was challenged today, then he declared to contestants to accept either his inclusion of other cases or exclusion of Fujimura. In my point of view, that is a very unwise way to cooperate with others who disagree with his edit because he can't own the article and demand others to follow his own rule. In the ongoing dispute, I got several inappropriate threats by him, and he even lied about my edit. So, I want admins at least give him a proper warning.

I'm happy to answer your questions, but I'm not exactly what your question is - what do you mean by """"moderated"""", precisely? All of the content you see on Wikipedia is contributed by users like yourself, making it a sort of very large scale collaboration project. So if your use of the word """"moderation"""" refers to the removal of vandalism, the answer is fairly simple: it too is all done by users, who keep a close eye on the recent changes around Wikipedia. There are some more complicated methods and tools that are employed to monitor these changes, but that's the simple answer. Is that what you were looking for?

 I hope you do not mind me asking but why is the name of the page the same as your username? You asked for help, well to wikify an article it means adding appropriate sections (which it has) and linking internally to other article which are relevant, for more info see Wikipedia:Wikify. For example in the character and history sections you could make an interwiki link on the word Villain by doing this: [[Villain]] and it would produce Villain. To link to an article with a slightly different word for example you wanted villainous to link to villain you would put [[Villain|Villainous]] and this would link the word villainous to villain.

Very strange.

You know what? Ashnard reminds me of Colonel Volgin. (You've played MGS:3 I assume.)
That's not good, by the way... do you like him too? Just picking on you, but still... it's a weird character to like soooo much. If it makes you feel better, I didn't like Ike too much, but don't you dare talk crap about Greil. Err. See you around, Ol' King Daein. Peregrine 

 Yes, I have played MGS3, I love that game, I am also quite partial to Greil (although I prefer to call him Gawain). Ashnard is quite like Volgin, but Ashnard isn't a bisexual pervert. So...Thanks for the comment, I'm really starting to get use to this place.  talk

If (1): As I have already clarified, the GA criteria indicate that those articles should be either improved to bring them up to legitimate GA status, or reassessed. CurtisNaito's track record of OWNership and edit-warring indicates that the former is impossible, leaving the latter option. Reassessing those articles would be in accordance with content policy, and I wasn't actually threatening to do so anyway; I was threatening not to do so. In my two years of arguing with CurtisNaito, I have in all but one occasion (the Emperor Jimmu article) chosen the carrot over the stick.
:If (2): You should express that opinion in an appropriate forum like an article talk page or the currently open History of Japan GAR. Blocking one side of a content dispute because you happen to agree with the other is inappropriate, especially when the other side has explicitly violated an ANI final warning numerous times over the past two weeks. (Note that I don't actually think this is why you blocked me. I'm grabbing at straws.)Sorry. Just noticed this.  (聖やや) 
If (3): You may be right, but look what I have had to deal with: CurtisNaito has requested four times in the last five months, on both ANI and ArbCom, that I be site-banned for disagreeing with his edits, even though pretty much everyone else disagrees with them too. If there's a hostile editing environment, I'm not the one to blame. And as in (1) above, it was not a threat anyway  I was offering a favour in exchange for CurtisNaito granting me the favour of not requesting that I be site-banned anymore. If this is what you meant, it's a good faith misunderstanding, and I will try to avoid such misunderstandings in the future, but I should still be unblocked.
If (4): Tell me the policy. I won't violate it again. I also won't appeal the block, though, since I've been here too long for ignorance of the rules to be a valid excuse.

 POV changes on Waco Siege 

Please read Wikipedia's neutral point of view policy, which all articles must follow.  Wikipedia is a neutral, verifiable encyclopedia; it is not a place to argue a particular point of view. Thank you. this serie of edits  appears to be an attempt to make the police force look like a military force, and try to make the force balance more balanced on favor fo the police. The substitution of """"National Guard members"""" for """"soldiers"""" was POV. And the addition of """"automatic"""" on national guard weapons and the addition of """"semi-automatic"""" on the davidians side is specially tendentious because AK-47 are not semi-automatic and you don't assert if those weapons were used by National Guard members anytime on the assault.

As an aside, you also change """"compound"""" for """"complex"""" and """"building"""", why do you do that? what is the source for that change? If you give no source, I might look at the sources myself and revert you if necesary   """,0.0

""":::::::::Hi Rhodes, 
Please read WP:UNDUE.
I've reveiwed the statement 'Dr. Michael Siedman a Michigan-based otolaryngologist who """"dabbles in herbal medicine"""".' and I believe it encourages a biased view against the subject. The subject in question has two degrees in the field of nutrition and two patents in a similar field. I appreciate the fact that the writer used the words the words 'dabbles in herbal medicine' while writing an article but using it as a basis for the doctor's description, given the majority of articles to the contrary, would be wrong and against wikipedia's policies.
Think what would happen if people chose to replace Bill Gate's qualifications in his wiki entry with some other article that described him as a man who 'dabbled into computers' just because a lone article described him in this light. If you have more than one article with a similar opinion then a case may be made. But basing an entire Wikipedia page on the opinion of only one article is a violation of wiki's rules.

Hello, Lmhirsch, and welcome to Wikipedia. Thank you for your contributions to the project.

You should probably check out Wikipedia's notability guidelines and this article about conflicts of interest while editing Wikipedia (since that article seems to contain information about you). This doesn't mean that you won't at some point be notable (again, check out the guidelines about this sort of thing), and if you are notable in the future, an article may be created about you; however, it would not replace the existing article. The new article would have a separate article name (such as Lee Hirsch (lawyer)) and then would be listed on a disambiguation page.

The existing pumps can be used with one regulator to adjust the capacity of pump/speed as per the supply of water in the bore wells which will maintain the continuity of flow; thereby the main principle of getting maximum water from the bore can be achieved i. e.

The COI tag, like most others, is a form of clean up notification. It's supposed to indicate that an article was authored by, or underwent a major edit by a conflicting party to other editors, who may then neutralise the content. It is not supposed to have full-time residence on the article once clean up has been performed and the editor/s with any COI cease to disruptively affect the neutrality of the article (which should really be brought to admin attention, not via a tag). Keeping it once the article has been made neutral is misleading and also makes Wiki articles """"ugly"""". There are thousands of articles on Wiki where the original author was closely-related to the content. Once an uninvolved editor steps in and makes the tone/content neutral the tag is no longer valid. Its purpose is to serve as a warning that the content may not be neutral to other editors. Given than a lot of editors have since taken control of the matter here, and are enforcing measures to prevent Dom and those closely related to Davina from introducing puffery, peacocking and any other bollocks, there isn't really any need to """"warn"""" anyone that the content may be untrue. I'm sure if or when Davina's meatpuppet """"fans"""" make edits they are quickly spotted, verified and removed if unsupported. As such, I recommend removing the tag, in due course, once the minor disputes are settled. Tags are aids for editors to develop the article as fore mentioned, they should not be used in the spirit of a warning system to general readers.  [Chat • RFF] """,0.0

Thanks for backing me up there, re: needing sources. I'm really not comfortable with even the existence of the article but haven't had the energy to do the research to prove it's not really a named region. Does anyone ever refer to Southeastern Oregon as a separate entity from Eastern Oregon? It's linked from the article about the current situation at Malheur, but I'm not sure we're doing our readers a service linking to that vs. linking to Eastern Oregon. On the one national radio story about it that I was paying attention to, they said the events were taking place in Eastern Oregon, which seems like enough precision for the casual readerthat is they need to know that it is the rural, conservative part of the state in contrast to Western Oregon. I'm not planning to wade into this until the situation has died down, but I'm curious what you and other WikiProject Oregon folks think about even having a Southeastern Oregon article. It's not like we have Northwestern Oregon, Southwestern Oregon or Northeastern Oregon articles.

You are right.  Gelato is simply Italian for ice-cream.  When I see it, I say """"gelato"""" in Italian and """"ice-cream"""" in English.  However, Americans think they are clever when they use foreign words, and they have decided that """"gelato"""" (or """"gelado"""" as they pronounce it) is some special thing similar to ice-cream but with less cream.  For the rest of us it's just """"a creamy brand of ice-cream"""" (una marca di gelato abbastanza cremoso) or """"a not so creamy brand of ice-cream"""" (una marca di gelato poco cremoso).

Here in Australia, it's even worse.  They say """"geladi"""", presumably because Italian ice-cream parlours have """"GELATI"""" (""""ICE-CREAMS"""") written out front, so they have decided that it is a special word for the product inside.

You'll see the same tendency in the word """"prosciutto"""".  People will actually say """"it's not ham; it's pro-shoo-do"""", which is bemusing to Italian-speakers.

"There are those sources who criticize Ramana Maharshi for a number of reasons, including that his state was delusional, what is seen as fatalism, on religious grounds, that he failed to take moral stands and seemed strangely detached on some world issues and believed there were greater powers governing the world, even that he was a tool of alien consciousness, etc. But I fail to see how claims by Alan Edwards that his failure to disassociate himself from political followers demonstrates political views has any particular value here. Ramana was distinguished by his openness to people of all sorts of views, his tolerance, his patience even when being hit by a thief, and his tailoring his responses to their perspectives to the point where there is seeming literal contradiction. It is well known that Gandhi sent some of his associates to Ramana Maharishi and that in response to questions about independence Ramana correctly predicted India would gain independence. But Ramana's attitude is best demonstrated by when people came to him to complain about perceived unfairness in the running of his Ashram and where he replied in so many words by questioning whether they had come to reform themselves or the Ashram. His responses to the first Westerner, a policeman who saw him back in 1911, offer no evidence of the orientalism during this period claimed. I do not see why we would add such poorly supported criticism based on his failure to distance himself from some followers just to have some criticism or how it would benefit casual readers.",0.0

"The other ironies of mentioning the 1958 Convention include the fact that Argentina never actually ratified that convention and that even if they had, geographic proximity was not, in and of itself, considered by that convention to be grounds to claim sovereignty over an inhabited territory controlled by another state.  Otherwise Japan would be part of Russia and Malta would be part of Italy and Sri Lanka would be part of India and so on through literally dozens of examples.  It's such a bad argument legally that I was concerned when it went in that including it might appear to discredit the Argentine position.  But if it is an argument made by Argentina and her supporters then it belongs.

I was trying to keep it more balanced between shipwreck and treasure, as they are equally important, but without the Jewel pics (as they have not emailed me back yet) perhaps it might be better to spread them around.

'Central estimates of the annual costs of achieving stabilisation between 500 and 550ppm CO2e are around 1% of global GDP, if we start to take strong action now.'
http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/CLOSED_SHORT_executive_summary.pdf

Why did you change the figure to 2%?

Kind regards",0.0

Yes, the money quote is that I'm fucking pissed off at the insistence of Richard James continually harrassing me, refusing to stop identifying my personal info. (as with posting my personal email above with website). I have vandalized nothing but to take a letter or two off of my personal name and words that lead to my personal info. in the slanderous and libelous and defaming posts of richard james. I don't give a shit that my project is not listed here. I found the whole process interesting and hilarious, though quite hypocritical. WHo can take the piss out of who here. THe article was about an art project, not me. I don't care that it's not there. It doesn't exist, nor does Bigfoot! His compromise was on day two of the original posting of the project article, a one man band who decides fist down who gets what and when, like a fascist pig. I could have campaigned for votes, but what the fuck...Before final vote and deletion, Richard James posted an article about me without my desire nor consent, and then deleted it in a violent fit of rage when I jokingly said the first article is dead at another's insistence that it should be deleted then at seven days. He's had the same hard-on ever since. As I said, I don't give a shit but that his posts are defaming, slanderous, libelous and outright insidious. His high and mighty accusational tone is what is weird and strange. All I have done in the past two days is to delete letters of my name and project, and the old username that I was attempting to expunge. Why?

"Which would be a perfectly true thing to say about Howard Dean, and probably belongs in an article about the association between mainstream Democrats and the Communist movement, if there is one. If there's not, no one's stopping you from creating one.

Donohue's willingness to find offense towards Catholicism at the slightest thing (a statue of Jesus made of chocolate, created by a Catholic sculptor, as a gift to the Church, is somehow offensive because of some Bible passage I must have missed about chocolate being created by the Devil) while himself constantly using terms of clear derision towards homosexuals, Jews, and Asians is a very important point, as Donohue's hypocrisy and selective outrage direclty relates to WHY the Catholic League is considered important. The purpose of the article should be directed towards answering the question of what the Catholic League means in American politics. That Donohue cares more about calling Democrats atheist anal sex fiends, so much that he would ally with open racists and actual anti-Catholics to do so, than he does about promoting what many others consider to be mainstream Catholic values is very relevant to why Donohue is important and worthy of an article here.",0.0

You say no transwomen believe this, it has been called a riddiculous straw man.

Read """"The theory that prenatally established brain and CNS   structures determine innate gender feelings and gender identity.""""  """"It appears that if those brain and CNS structures are masculinized   in early pregnancy by hormones in the fetus, then the child will   have male percepts and a male gender identity, independent of   whether the genes or genitalia are male. If those structures   are not masculinized in early pregnancy, the child will have   a female percepts and a female gender identity, again independent   of the genes or genitalia. As in the case of intersex infants   having ambiguous genitalia, there are undoubtedly many degrees   of cross-gendering of brain and CNS structures, so that while   some infants are completely cross-gendered others are only partially   cross-gendered.(verbatim)""""  This is basically the feminine essence theory. When one adds that there is only one way to be cross-gendered in the brain, and that cross gendering must be totally separate in any and every way from sexualorientation. That there is in essence one way to be feminine; that is the feminine essence theory.

Interestingly if I understood JamesCantor correctly in a conversation we had on my talk page.  This is very close to what he and sexologist like him belive. However they contend that the way in which a brain is cross-gendered depends on sexualorientation.  Thus take a homosexual male.  Homosexual males have been shown to think and have some brain structures like those of straight women.  A homosexual transsexual is just a case where there is more enough female brain structure present to make a person mentally female.  While non-homosexual transsexuals, if I understood correctly, also have cross gender structures in their brains, just not the same as a homosexual transsexuals.  The non-homosexual MTF transsexual brains retaining more masculine brain structure.  That is the crux of the problem isn't it now.  That Blanchard's theory not only contradicts the feminine essence/ female brain sex theory of MTF transsexualism....but it then says ok one kind of transsexual really does work that way.

So you haven't done your homework, you refuse to read or listen to the answers to your questions and then you delete the references that have them.  You are quite a piece of work.  What happened to freedom of speech and free open honest discussion where people can be swayed by reasoned thought?

I am curious what all the other wiki editors who have been following this think.  Of course it will be difficult for them to research the sources you have removed and now locked out.  How about that.  

Suggestion: if you were really as honest as you like to think you are, you would put both articles on the page for everyone to read and vote on.  Yours as it now is, and mine as I last left it.

It says in the instruction to new editors to assume good faith.  That has not been my experience of you, and from my point of view, you have now demonstrated that beyond any doubt.
There are other issues here.  Everywhere I look in wikipedia I see poorly written, out of date articles, or articles with messages requesting that someone update them.  I am curious how many others have had similar experiences to what I have had here and who have lost interest and moved on? Does anyone keep track of wikipedia's hit count and how it has changed over the years?  Or the number of active wiki editors?  I wouldn't be surprised one little bit to find out it both have leveled out and gone into decline.  If so, has it occurred to you that that might be a signal of some sort?
This issue also points out another major flaw in wikipedia; the fact that a single admitted non-expert in a field of study can override multiple experts from NASA, Lockheed Martin, JPL, etc., on a topic as you have done here. 

You have some serious issues here.  I will be interested in seeing how you resolve them, assuming that you can.  Or will this article remain as it now is, another stone in the constipated belly of wikipedia, for years to come?

I just had an idea.  I am going to put the article as I last left it right here so that the other wiki editors who have been following this can read and compare without editorials from either of us.  
It will be interesting to see if you have the courage to leave it alone and allow others to form their own opinion and do their own research.

A skyhook is a proposed space transportation concept that aims to reduce the cost of placing payloads into space. 

Skyhooks are often confused with an Earth surface to geostationary orbit space elevator, but they are different.  A skyhook is much shorter than a space elevator and does not reach down to the surface of the Earth.  A skyhook requires a suborbital launch vehicle to get to the bottom end of the skyhook, a space elevator does not.  Due to the much shorter length of the skyhook and the resulting reduction in strain, skyhooks up to 4,000 km in length can be built with existing materials, while an Earth surface to geostationary orbit space elevator cannot.Amanda S. Wu, Tsu-Wei Chou, """"Carbon Nanotube Fibers for Advanced Composites"""", Materials Today, vol. 15, July–August 2012, pp. 302-310   

The advantage of a skyhook it that the lower end of the cable is moving at less than orbital velocity for its altitude.  As a result, a launch vehicle flying to the bottom of the skyhook can carry a larger payload than it could going directly to orbit on its own.  When the cable is long enough, single stage to skyhook flight with a reusable launch vehicle such as a spaceplane becomes possible.  Reusability of the launch vehicle and an enlarged payload fraction makes for much lower launch costs.   Once the cable has become long enough the skyhook becomes cost competitive with what is realistically thought to be achievable using a space elevator (assuming a space elevator can ever be built), and the skyhook can be built.{{cite jour",0.0

 Anti-Aging (foto of something in Germany) 

There's a foto labeled """"Sign outside a modern anti-ageing clinic in Germany.""""

First off HESA is not merely """"some 3rd party statistics society"""", it is the recognised main source of data about higher education in the UK. And it gets its figures from the universities directly (with clear pro forma) - the differences between the HESA tables and the respective university publicity (Oxford is not the first institution where this query has been raised) are primarily down to how things are counted, including extra-mural students and whether part timers are counted per head or as a fraction (and more minorly over when in the year the figures are for). They're certainly not counting staff or academic departments. You may have a point about using a different HESA table but it should be standard across the board for UK universities for consistency and comparison - if we let each university article pick whichever table fits local impressions best then the information will be less useful overall.

Kaiser's logo is relevant to anyone who wants to know about Kaiser, it seems Wikipedia considers the identity of the CEO of an organization relevant, and their website seems almost required - if someone, for instance, came to Wikipedia in order to find the website, they should be able to do so moderately easily; Kaiser's website should, in an article about Kaiser, stand out from all other links in some way.

Unless you think you're a lexicographer, relying on the dictionary immunizes yourself from charges of POV.
Now that it looks like some reform is gonna stick, I am much less unsatisfied than I was when I came upon the article back in June or whenever.  But it is clunky, designed by committee.  I had hoped that enough of you guys would understand the importance of defining time, on the outset, as these two different (and not really competing) definitions, first as a phenomenon (where I drew every word out of the dictionary references, including """"indefinite"""" and """"existence"""", etc.) and then as a measurement (what Steve Quinn likes to call the """"operational"""" definition).  And I had hoped that, because measurement is done both with clocks we build (to measure time in material reality) and with our conscious experience (which is debated among philosophers and lay people as to whether or not that is contained in material reality or is somehow different) that you guys (with the exceptions of SQ and JW) would see the wisdom of not jamming them together in a run-on sentence and see the wisdom of setting up the topic in all three major POVs: Time as phenomenon, Time as physical measurement, Time as experience right away in two lede sentences.  Everything else in the article will fall under one of those three; """"religion, philosophy, and science... business, industry, sports, the sciences, music, dance, and the live theater"""".  I am convinced that the professor would grade my lede definition higher than what is there now, and far better than what was there before.  Too bad.  But the status quo isn't better than what existed before and since I was unsuccessful (even though everything is solidly referenced) in convincing you, I'll let it go.  Unless SQ or JW try to crap up the lede again, then I'll be back, and the rest of us also should be vigilant.  Maybe someday, this will be a good article.  But no matter how well the rest of the article is done, if the lede is crappy, the article as a whole cannot be """"good"""".

 Article Licensing 

Whenever I need a WikiVacation, sometimes I go back to working on articles that absolutely no one would think to write about so they leave me alone.  Anyway if you ever come back and have a moment to consider this, I've """"started"""" the  which aims to get users to release all of their contributions to the U.S. state, county, and city articles (if any) under the CC-by-sa 1.0 and 2.0 license (at minimum) or into the public domain if they prefer.  A secondary, but equally important, goal is to get those users to release ALL of their edits for ALL articles.  I've personally chosen to multi-license all of the  and  contributions under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike License so that other projects, such as WikiTravel, can use our articles.  I was wondering if you would be willing to multi-license all your contributions (or at minimum those on the geographic articles) so that we can keep most of the articles available under the multi-license.  Many users use the {{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}} template (or even {{MultiLicensePD}} for public domain) on their user page, but there are other templates for other options at Template messages/User namespace.  If you only prefer using the GFDL, I understand, but I thought I'd at least ask, just in case, since the number of your edits is in the top 100.  If you do want to do it, simply just copy and paste one of the above two templates into your user page and it will allow us to track those users who have done it. For example:

Option 1
I agree to [[Wikipedia:Multi-licensing|multi-license]] all my contributions, with the exception of my user pages, as described below:
{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}
OR
Option 2
I agree to [[Wikipedia:Multi-licensing|multi-license]] all my contributions to any [[U.S. state]], county, or city article as described below:
{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}

The previous comment makes several incorrect statements about Baybayin's status as a script, the origin of its name, and what """"Sanskrit"""" refers to. Baybayin is a single script, like Latin, Arabic or Devanagari in all their variations are single scripts. It is most definitely not a group or family of scripts; no separate """"Sulat Bisaya"""" ever existed, and authentic Kapampangan script was merely the most notable regional variant of Baybayin. There were no special regional variations despite the false impression given by inaccurately wirtten samples of Baybayin from various regions as written by foreigners not used to writing the letters correctly. Scott, Villamor and especially Santamaría have shown clearly that the handwriting of different people in the same region, even from the same document, shows moer differences than the so-called """"regional scripts"""" written in distorted handwriting by foreigners. Modern """"Kulitan"""" or """"Súlat Kapampangan"""" is the recent invention of one person who took a 19th century French visitor's interpretation of Baybayin letters as written in an unknown source or sources from Pampanga, and combined these with a structure derived from a combination of Kawi and Korean Han'gul. It is a modern constructed script with no relation to how it was actually written when it was used as part of daily life. The name Baybayin originated with Tagalog speakers, not the Spanish, who at first just called it """"sus letras"""" (their letters). Baybayin comes from a word that originally meant to put things in a sequence or a particular order.  Sanskrit is a language, not a script or group of scripts. All these facts can be checked in the existing literature. Anyone who wants to write an accurate article should consult at the very least Paul Morrow's web site """"Ang Baybayin"""", Santamaría's """"El """"Baybayin"""" en el archivo de Santo Tomas"""", Villamor's """"The Old Philippine Writing/La Antigua Escritura Filipina"""", and Marcilla y Martín's """"Estudio de los Antiguos Alfabetos Filipinos"""".

""" has existed on all continents. And because it is a general name, it should reflect general details rather than anything specific. This is basically why the term prehistoric religion is not used, because it is too general.   
Oh yeah and origin of religion is very precise.  I'm still waiting for a better title.  
yes origin of religion is not precise, this is why I changed the name to """"Evolutionary theories on the origin of religion"""". However if evolution is accepted as fact, then teleological arguments on the origin of religion cannot be considered scientific, in which case the evolutionary theories on the origin of religion and """"origin of religion"""" are the same.   
First of all I have told you a thousand times already that actual evolutionary theories on the origin of religion are like those of Boyer, Wolpert and Dawkins and they are miles away from what you have been writing about.  Also the logic you present above is simply not correct at all.  The fact that human physiology is a product of biological evolution does not mean that the origin of religion can be explained through evolutionary mechanisms or as a product of biological evolution.  Perhaps without the evolution of certain cognitive capacities human practices like religion would not be possible, but the origin of religion itself may be entirely """"social"""" or """"cultural"""" given a certain state of cognitive evolution.  If that were the case then theories of religion's origin would not be evolutionary theories at all, yet they would be equally """"scientific"""" and clearly non-religious in nature.  That is to say biological evolution itself is not necessarily causal of religion, even if it may be necessary to create a certain precondition (e.g. a capacity for symbolic thought) for religious belief.  

content dispute
We have a content dispute that is mainly between myself and you. Dbachmann occasionaly gets involved switching between sides. But essentially this is between me and you. This is why we are not making progress, because we do not have any editors who are willing to dedicate the time and effort to work on this this. Consequently you are taking advantage of this lack of editors and you are using an old AFD as your leverage, because you can run to any admin, who only know the rules and know little about content. This is unfair and unacademic and is very political. Dbachmann knows very well that the articles I created are valid. He has admitted that he agrees in principal with the ideas I have presented, but simply disagrees with me because he dislikes my demeanor User_talk:Dbachmann#origin_of_religion. I had worked on the article """"Origin of language"""" using the same approach. Before I started working on the origin of language, the topic was approached from a psychological or sociological perspective filled with archaic fringe and opinionated theories. I proceeded to add the evolutionary perspective to the article, after which Dbachmann reviewed the article with some refactoring he upgraded the article to B-class. I used the same approach on the origin of religion only to be met with some of the worst hostility to knowledge. As I often mention, you had even disputed the out of Africa hypothesis, or that grave goods are considered evidence of a belief in the afterlife . Here you are seen to be making up your own theories. So I do feel justified to doubt the credibility of some of your assertions and also some of the other editors. I have always asked admins and a lot of other editors to assist in dispute resolution, but many seem content with pushing buttons and chasing after vandals and boosting their egos by blocking people, they have no interest in content. So I propose to go for dispute resolution, if you think you have a case, you should opt for it. If you are afraid and want to continue using the archaic AFD as your silver bullet, then this dispute will needlessly continue. Of course the result will be blocks of which I am the top candidate, but what a waste that would be. Who would be there to provide education on grave goods.   
You've not described a content dispute but simply congratulated yourself, dismissed the behavioral policing of admins, and fabricated behavior on my part.

Admin input:
If you were in communication with an admin, and were actively working on it, you (or the admin) should have actually put a valid hangon message on the talk page. Quite frankly, I don't believe the draft article you're working on is ready to go for the following reasons:

Bolding is for the first use of the subject in the lead paragraph only 
References shouldn't be generalized like you've put them. Individual facts in the article should be footnoted to the references (see WP:FN and WP:CITET if you don't know how to do this)

Move the reasons why its notable (media coverage, awards) to the 1st or 2nd paragraph

I haven't got enough experience to know what might need to be done, and how far short it would be at the moment. Any pointers would be welcome.

I feel no strong urge to make a change. The source does say bug and not insect. Technically I see nothing wrong with saying insect because a bug is a type of insect.

I did not say what you repeatedly say I said. You have several times now said I should be blocked for calling somebody a """"cunt"""". You have repeatedly made false accusations against me without a single time providing a diff. I am well aware of what I have written and where it was written. I have not called you or anybody else such a word anywhere on Wikipedia. The most outrageous thing in the diff in which you were blocked for was not your reference to """"cancer"""". It is your persistence in spreading false and malicious commentary about me. In that diff you say When Nableezy had the balls to say that he knew someone was a sockpuppet but that he was keeping his mouth shut because he likes him it showed that he was here for one reason and one reason only. Post a diff that backs that comment up. Just one, try to find one. Later on you say this time he called people cunts. Could you please provide a diff in which I call people (pl) cunts (pl) or even a person a cunt? Of course you cant, but that doesnt stop you. I dont even care if you are blocked or not, I wanted an admin to make you stop making these outrageous accusations without providing any evidence. Earlier you made several allusions to various people who think I was socking. You back out of it by saying """"Im not the one accusing you, just other unnamed people do"""", as if that allows you to drop such an accusation with out one bit of evidence.The other problems with your comment aside, the accusation that you made that I """"breed cancer"""", that cancer being sockpuppetry, shows only how obsessed you are with directing fault to me. You think I am the reason NoCal or Dajudem socks? Really? I, hoping that I am right, will assume you say this because you are just unaware of the actual history, as opposed to purposely ignoring or distorting it. Much of this happened before my time here, but before I got involved in editing here I read a quite a bit of the history, through article and user talk pages and archives, AfDs, ANI, AE, AN3, ..., and the arbitration cases. So I have a certain familiarity with the actors of this play and know the story fairly well. Once upon a time, there was a user named Isarig. This user has had their account """"vanished"""" to . Some things I dont know, as the user's talk page is deleted, and others dont need to be discussed, but this user vanished at the start of the ARBPIA case. The user already had a history of socking, how much is one of the things I dont know. This happened late 2007/early 2008, with his last edit talking place on Dec 24 2007. NoCal100 was created Jan 3 2008. Canadian Monkey Dec 30 2007. Mr Hicks The III is an older sock, from Sep 2007. There were a few others created back then. All this before this monstrous creature you refer to as Nableezy arrived and caused this man to start socking.Now, as for your BFF (Stellarkid). The account Dajudem was given a topic ban after the CAMERA lobbying issue came to light in April 2008. One month later the Tundrabuggy account was created. One of the first things this account did was to go after, in a purely vindictive manner, one of the admins who had dealt with that issue. She, dishonestly posing as a new editor confused by the rules, was able to game the system into producing several blocks or bans against that admin. She followed him from article to article, going away from the A/I area into random areas such as Persian history. She was able to hide the fact that she was doing this for some time, until she was discovered as Dajudem's sock and blocked. One month later, a new account, Stellarkid, is created. Posing as a new account confused by the rules, this new sock proceeds to do the same thing she did with that earlier admin with a new target (guess who?). She is able to successfully get a ban placed against her target. When this account is discovered to be a sock, a new account (in fact several) was created. Three separate accounts were blocked last time around, including one with no edits just waiting to be put in to use. So Dajudem began socking prior to ever seeing me, yet I am responsible for her continued socking? And NoCal? I am responsible for dozen or so different accounts that I know that he has, and that isnt counting the ones from Isarig? How can you possibly blame me for the fact that a number of die hard members of the Defenders of the Glorious Cause have repeatedly socked?But back to the point, dont make accusations that you cant provide evidence for. Either provide a diff of me calling somebody a """"cunt"""" or retract the charge. Same for the accusation that I knowingly overlooked sockpuppetry because I liked a user. nableezy - """,0.2857142857142857

 The article started by simply mentioning that the individual began as a DJ in 1998 and that he played at raves, which did not seem very notable to me.

As to RoyBoy, he is not very good at checking his facts. Even a cursory Google would show that Jonathan Sarfatti and Jack Sarfatti are not the same person and live on different continents. Notice how silent the Great Mathematician Dr. Hillman is in the light of Nobel Prize physicist Brian Josephson's remark above putting him in his proper place and in Hillman's inability to respond to Sarfatti's detailed argument above. It is not enough to bluster """"it's nonsense"""". Burinski will also respond he is not on e-mail all the time. None of your facts check out. Everything Sarfatti has said is the truth and his arguments on the physics have not been refuted. You people not only have no respect for truth, you simply cannot even perceive it because this information is too advanced for all of you - even Chris Hillman who is not a physicist although he is a mathematician of sorts - he admits he is not even interested in quantum theory so he should recuse himself if he were really honest. Brian Josephson wrote the reality above.

Dear C.Fred, this is ridiculous. I'm just conveying a fact, and Wikipedia is blocking me as soon as I do. I'm like the boy that states the fact that the emperor is naked, and you're among the public that tells him to be quiet. Can you please tell me what I possibly can write about clades and cladistics that will not block me? Anything that isn't right on the point? Cladistic is is in fact a mental desease. Is it possible to say that a mental desease is a mental desease? At the same time as Object-Oriented modeling is making great progress in geographical information systems (like you can see on CNN almost every night illustrating statistics for US and parts of it) and in a multitude of other applications, the inconsistent, self-contradictory and empirically erroneous cladism holds its fort against it by oppression of its opponents (for example blocking me). I have supported my statements with facts, and none of the influential cladists even dare to challenge them. Gareth Nelson tried every night for at least five months without success. The fact that he even tried is a measure of the importance he assesses them. In this continuing blocking of me, Wikipedia at least has to set a time limit as to when it regards the facts I'm stating (i.e., that time is relative) as being generally accepted (among cladists?). This discussion is totally and utterly ridiculous. Cladism does in fact deny that time can be relative, instead claiming that it is relations that are are relative, that is, that relative is relative. How long do we have to continue discussing a paranoia? Why not just conclude that it is a paranoia? Cladists don't understand that it is they that conceptualize reality, but instead think they find concepts. They think things have conceptual labels all around them, that they are branded. It is ridiculous, ridiculous... 

I thus contest being blocked for telling the truth. I argue that if telling the truth in itself is a reason for being blocked, then Wikipedia can certainly not be allocated to the category 'encyclopedia', since the definition of this concept surely must include telling the truth (to the best of its ability). If Wikipedia contest this argument, then I demand a specification of which part(s) of it. (I, however, have no illusions. I expect this contest to lead to my blocking from this page too. I expect to be blocked everytime I tell the truth. It doesn't stop me. I will continue telling the truth until it penetrates cladists foggy brains, or at least diagnoses their foggy brains as the foggy brains they are. In the meantime, Wikipedia will have major problems trying to hinder their confusion to spread to phylogenetics, evolution, medicine and maybe even science itself. Cladism actually hates science in its traditional form, i.e., as described by Karl Popper, and is presently trying to roll out its confusional mat over it. Just read the """"explanation"""" of phylogenetics and you have to understand what I mean. It is totally impossible to make """"heads and tails"""" of. If it belongs in an encyclopedia, then I'm Santa, Cladism is not science, but rather a reaction against science). Consist (presently at 83.254.20.53  )""",0.0
"There are two criteria at play here: first, does it bear the Final Fantasy title, in any form or region? This covers most of what we've got. Second, if the first does not apply, does it feature a major appearance by characters or settings strongly associated with the Final Fantasy series. Kingdom Hearts does, since about half of the major NPCs are from the series. Ehrgeiz does, since it has several playable characters (one of whom is actually on the cover of the game) from Final Fantasy VII. Secret of Evermore might, as well: I was under the impression that the appearances were more along the lines of brief cameos that integral roles, but if someone wants to argue otherwise, I'm listening. Super Mario RPG does not fit under either of these categories: it was never called Final Fantasy: Super Mario RPG (or whatever), and it has but one piece of music to connect it to the series. –",0.0

 Untrue Wikipedia statements need correction 

 Wikipedia on  Nicolaus Copernicus now states:

Born 19 February 1473(1473-02-19),
Toruń (Thorn), Royal Prussia, Poland 
Died 24 May 1543 (aged 70),
Frombork (Frauenburg), Warmia, Poland 

The city of birth was Thorn Thorun in the country of Prussia. 

It was not Poland (even though western Prussia or Prussia Occidentalis or Royal Prussia or West Prussia, was for a time protectorate of the crown of Poland-Lithuania and Wikipedia also has much wrong onesided POV, (enforced by a large group of Polish speakers) in those articles). 

The part of Prussia where Nicolaus Copernicus lived, worked and died was the Prince-Bishopric of Ermland, Latin Warmia and the name of the city where Copernicus lived for most years and where he died was Frauenburg in Ermland in Prussia. Again , it was not Poland. 

Prussians in all parts of Prussia (western, eastern and Ermland) held continous PRUSSIAN INDIGENAT-Prussian citizenship - NOT POLISH.

Wikipedia article repeatedly disregard International Law in articles about history and people from east of the Oder-Neisse line, making everything and everyone east of the Oder Neisse appear as Polish. 

Wikipedia mainly reflects Polish POV most of it from books from Communist Polish Historiography POV. 

The irony is, that honest Polish writers distance themselves from the Communist Polish Historiography, yet Wikipedia has become Communist Polish POV's greatest perpetrator and now spreads it as """"universal knowledge"""" all across the globe by multiple mirrors. An Observer(70.133.67.155  )""",0.0

He told the New York Times. """"There are various interpretations possible: The big increase in hurricane power over the past 30 years or so may not have much to do with global warming, or the models are simply not faithfully reproducing what nature is doing. Hard to know which to believe yet.”

In 2005, a few weeks before Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, Emmanuel asserted in a paper that he had found statistical evidence linking rising hurricane energy and global warming.

His conversion is a very important new development in the climate debate, said Marc Morano, a top aide to climate change skeptic Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla.

""""First, 2007 turned out to be the ‘tipping point’ for global warming fears, and 2008 appears to be the year of vindication for skeptics as many prominent scientists reverse their climate views, more and more skeptical scientists speak out, and new data debunks man-made climate fears.

“Now another major scientist reconsiders his views on a significant aspect of man-made climate fears.”

Insisting on 'equal coverage' of women and men will result in unequal proportion of notable and non-notable people.

There are two pieces of evidence that suggest that the cause was carbon monoxide poisoning.  I made the identification of Malcolm's remains at the morgue in Chicago and when I did so I noticed that he had an unusual red skin color.  At the time I was unaware of how this might have arisen but it was so striking that I did comment on it to a number of acquaintances.  I learned later that this skin color is characteristic of carbon monoxide poisoning.  In addition, the person in whose apartment Malcolm was sleeping that night described to me several days later that leaking gas from the space heater in the apartment had been discovered on the morning after Malcolm's death; that the gas company had been called and that the gas had been turned off until the problem could be fixed.  The danger from such gas is due to the possibility of explosion, and to the toxic carbon monoxide it contains.- """,0.0

 Angolan Civil War 

Hello: having worked on Angola for more than four decades, I have over the last two years or so tried to improve articles on Angola in WP (several languages). I was thus delighted to see your recent work on the en:WP article on the Angolan Civil War, which is a period I have somewhat neglected with regard to the military side. I wonder whether we can agree on the following points:
 The civil war in Angola ran from 1975 to 2002. The war for independence stopped effectively in April 1974, although a formal peace agreement was signed in January 1975 only. What I call the """"decolonization conflict"""" is the fight between the nationalist movements & allies from April 1974 to November 1975 (independence). This conflict becomes a civil war after independence. Civil war can be divided in two periods: until 1991 (Cuban and South African military involvement) and 1991-2002 (external support only). I think this periodization is important, because it permits to specify the participation of other countries.
 There was direct participation of Cuba and SA in the fighting in 1974/75 as well as in 1975-1991. 
 I have never heard of the involvement of French & Morroccan troops: what are your sources? 
 The support of the Soviet Union consisted of air transport for Cuban troops, furnishing military equipment, and a few advisors, mostly in 1974/75, less in 1975-1991.
 Zaire supported the FNLA (logistics, equipment) and (small) contingents of troops, mainly in 1974/75, less so in 1975-1991 (when, as far as I know, the FNLA ceased it military activity as early as 1976/77)
 The US gave UNITA logistical, material and diplomatic support 1975-1991.
 China gave the FNLA some (unspecified) support in the early 1960s, and shifted this support (which then included military training in China for come cadres) to UNITA after 1966. This is uncontested  see e.g. John Marcum's book.
 Algeria supported the MPLA 1961-1974, mainly by hosting a pivotal group of MPLA exile cadres. I don't know about any further support.
 I don't have any sources on Libyan involvement.
 I am quite surprised at you mentioning the FNLC: what are the sources?
 Gabon and Côte d'Ivoire: I don't have sources, either.
 Mozambique: the FRELIMO regime has given """"fraternal"""" moral and diplomatic support to the MPLA from the 1960s onwards, but as far as I know, there was no military involvement (so much the less as there was a civil war going on in Mozambique as well).

Do you think you could answer to all this, on this page? Thank you in advance    """,0.0

I'm not sure and will think about it. , I'm doubt anything could be written about the SNPU that we couldn't fit into the Svoboda article, and so I tend to agree with you.

Nevertheless, we might all agree that far-right politics are in flux right now in Ukraine, and I wouldn't be surprised if many go the most far-right elements around Svoboda are now attracted to Right Sector.

Now these groups helped form Right Sector.

I think the Svoboda article could be improved by writing about all of this, and incorporating the SNPU material as well. It'll be easier a year from now when more academic material has been written about the current situation in Ukraine. -  """,0.0

 Crocus olivieri istanbulensis 

Dear Rivertorch,

This taxon is one on the three subspecies of Crocus olivieri.
Its correct name is Crocus olivieri Gray subsp. istanbulensis B. Mathew. I have corrected it. 

I hope the anonymous user will not change it again.

Best regards,  (To reply) 

Hi Réginald. If you hadn't arrived on the scene, I was going to ping you. I removed the Turkish image and link, since I didn't think they were germane, but I left it to you to fix the taxonomic details. Does Mathew's classification, as it appears in the article, contain all the known species of crocus?   

Hi River,
The page contains all the recorded species, but not the infraspecific taxa (i.e., the numerous subspecies). Originally Crocus olivieri subsp. istanbulensis was for this reason not included. For consistency reason including it required to mention also -as I did- the two other subspecies olivieri and balansae.
The issue is: if we want to be fully consistent we have to mention also all recorded subspecies (with their distribution as for that of C. olivieri?), among others the numerous subspecies of the variable C. biflorus. A niggling work! I am afraid that the page will become too scholastic.
Your advice about this issue?
Best regards,  (To reply) 
PS: You can find a quite complete list of species and their subspecies on the NCBI taxonomy browser. Type """"Crocus"""" in the """"search for"""" bar.  (To reply) 

Thanks for the link—that's a great resource. I don't think we should worry about its being too scholastic. My main concern would be with consistency: I'm not sure if there are comparable articles that also list all subspecies. The information about subspecies certainly should be available on Wikipedia, but should it go in the main article or in the more specific articles about each species (of which there are now only a few). I don't know.   
For consistency reasons I have added the other subspecies reported in the NCBI taxonomy and cited the source. I agree that additional paragraphs or articles should be written for the most representative species, in which a detailed description of their subspecies would then be done (as e.g. I have done in fr:Crocus).  (To reply) 
Okay. I'd be happy to help with creating new articles and refining translations, if you want to go that route. Just remember I don't know what I'm talking about ;-)    

Dear River,
I have removed again the the logo of the Sultanbeyli District Municipality, that User:Terzinator had added again to Crocus, explaining the reason for doing it (see User talk:Terzinator). Hopefully, he/she will not add it again!
Best regards,  (To reply) 
Thanks, Réginald. I don't do edit wars, so I'm glad there's someone else diligently watching the page. I see that the image appears to lack any copyright info or fair-use claims. I try to avoid any involvement with enforcement of image policies, but if it gets added again I will see if it can be deleted on those grounds.

 Christianity and its Polytheistic Attributes  

Here are some credible, scholarly sources, as requested, for the statement about Christianity and how it is believed to be polytheistic. I request that editors maintain an impartial approach when dealing with Christianity-related articles and other religious articles. I further request that editors acknowledge the polytheistic elements of the Christian faith, the controversy around the issue, and that Christianity believed to be polytheistic by some. 

It says in the American Encyclopedia (an academic accredited work): 

""""The belief in the Oneness of God – as a theological movement – began at a very early stage in history, and in fact it preceded the belief in trinity by many decades. Christianity developed from Judaism, and Judaism firmly believes that there is one God. 

The path that led from Jerusalem (the home of the first disciples of Christ) to Nicea (where it was decided in 325 CE that Christ was equal to God in essence and eternal nature) can hardly be described as a straight path. 

The doctrine of trinity which was affirmed in the fourth century CE bears no resemblance to the original teachings of Christ concerning the nature of God. Au contraire, it is the opposite, a deviation from that teaching. Hence it developed in opposition to the belief in One God… (27/294)"""" 

Will Durant, in his The Story of Civilization says: 

""""When Christianity conquered Rome, the new religion (i.e., Christianity) was infused with the blood of the old idolatrous religion: the title of archbishop, worship for the great mother, and an innumerable number of lords who gave peace of mind and were like who exist in all places and cannot be detected with the senses. All of this came into Christianity as the blood of the mother comes into her child. 

The civilized empire handed over power and administration to the papacy and the impact of the word replaced the impact of the sword. The preachers of the church started to assume positions of power. 

Christianity did not put an end to idolatry, rather it reinforced it. The Greek mind came back to life in a new form, in the doctrines and rituals of the church. The Greek rituals appeared in the rituals of the monastic saints. From Egypt came the idea of the holy trinity, the day of reckoning, eternal reward and punishment, and man’s eternal life in one of the other. From Egypt also came the worship of the mother and child, the mystical union with God, the union which led to Platonism and agnosticism, and the erasing of Christian doctrine. And from Persia came the belief in the return of the Messiah and his ruling the earth for 1000 years. 

Despite the element of atheism in the words of Durant, which is something that he is known for, and which is apparent in his claim that the idea of eternal reward or punishment came from the Egyptians, tracing the origins of deviant idolatry in Christianity is no longer a secret, and he is not the only one who has researched them. In his book Christianity and Idolatry, Robertson states that Mithraism, which is a religion of Persian origin, flourished in Persia approximately six centuries before the birth of Christ, and it reached Rome around the year 70 CE, where it spread throughout the Roman lands. Then it reached Britain and spread to a number of British cities. What concerns us here about this religion is that it says: 

-         That Mithras, after whom it is named, was an intermediary between God and man (for a similar doctrine in Christianity, see Acts 4:12).

-         He was born in a cave or in a corner of the earth (cf. Luke 2:8)

-         His birthday was December 25 (which is the day celebrated by the Christians as the day when Jesus was born)

-         He had twelve disciples (cf. Matthew 10:1)

-         He died to save the world (cf. I Corinthians 15:3)

-         He was buried but he came back to life (cf. I Corinthians 15:4)

-         He ascended to heaven in front of his disciples (cf. Acts 1:9)

-         He was called “Saviour” (cf. Titus 2:13)

-         Among his attributes is that he is like a peaceful lamb (cf. John 1:29)

-         The “Divine supper” was held in his memory every year (cf. I Corinthians 11:23-25)

-         One of his symbols was baptism

-         Sunday was sacred to them """"

The French Orientalist Leon Joteh, is of the view that:

Also please read this excerpt of what I wrote:

You can thank me later for it but I'll tell you Parseval's identity. It's more conceptual to think of L^2 the space of measurable square-integrable functions on [-pi,pi] as a complex inner product space (Hilbert space). The idea is that the space has an orthonormal basis (general orthornormal basis can be found by wavelets) such as {e^{-in}} for n an integer. And if f is a function in L^2 you can take its inner product against each of these functions and get """"components"""" of f. The point is, as you'd expect in any Hilbert space, the components are the only relevant data when it comes to taking inner products. So you can find the inner product (an integral) of two functions just by knowing their Fourier coefficients. Pretty cool math dude? So basically I advise you to find the Fourier coefficients of the function """"x"""" on [-pi,pi] and take the inner product of this function with itself and apply Parseval. The PROOF of Parseval is probably well beyond the scope of your education; you'll see it when you get to university. It involves proving the completeness of the trigonometric system (in the L^2 case) which can be done nicely with convolution but I'll save the details to your lecturers at first year undergrad. uni.

While Eläkeläiset is a humppa-band per se, humppa style of music is represented rather differently in Finland, where they are hard-touring dance-bands that compared to Eläkeläiseti are much more polished and suited for formal dancing occasions. Whereas Eläkeläiset by style is much more rockish, which is seen in their shows and fanbase.

 Głos 

Hello there. I was wondering if I could enlist that """"proficient nitpicker"""" side of your contributions on a Polish-related subject that I would stand no chance of approaching myself. While I was writing the Sămănătorul article a while back, I encountered a reference to Głos, and assume from the context that it refers to either an old avatar of the present-day magazine or a completely unrelated defunct publication. The article doesn't explicitly say either. Here's where you come in: in case it's the same magazine, could you add just a bit there on how old it actually is? and in case it's not, could you suggest under what title the potential article is likely to pop up when it does? Many thanks in advance.

Hence, Congressional relocation funding. So, the bottom line was money, and questionnable technical feasibility. The study is probably cited in the hearings for the funding legislation.
Keep in mind there are hundreds of miles of old underground mines under Centralia, too deep to strip mine from the surface, too many surface openings to plug, and the smoke and steam are lethal to humans and other living things. That's why people needed to be relocated: living in Centralia is hazardous to one's health. And when coal is burned, it loses 90% of its mass, so the ground above often subsides, opening new pathways for air to enter and fuel the fires. There have long been reports of more people living there than should be, possibly including some who were paid to leave.

 Up to your old tricks I see 

Thankfully I have not had the displeasure or the need to smell your odious stench on this site for a while as thankfully wikipedia is large enough to avoid contemptible creatures like you.

However I notice we have crossed swords again with you crying out your age old mantra - like the fucktard you are - it's """"unsourced"""". Well done, fucking well done, you are so pig-shit thick and lazy rather than 1. do a little bit of work and find some sources yourself, you just delete stuff because it takes less effort, or 2. assume good faith. Most people don't make stuff up that they add. If you had one iota of sense in that pig-shit brain of yours, you would at least do a quick internet search to check the facts before having a WP:OWN fap and then deleting anything that you like. 

Personally I think, and I have said this before, you make absolutely no positive contributions to this site. Just looking at your edit log clearly shows you generate nothing or even bother to write something = er this is an encyclopedia. If you had your way, it would be whittled down to nothing. You have got talent or knowledge except self-importance because it's easier to be a fucking Rules Lawyer than an editor. 

I have nothing but the utter contempt for you because you cannot even do the most simplest of things and look up something. If Wikipedia is measured by the likes of you, then it's stands by the lowest common denominator: ignorance. Your application of sourcing is so fucked up and arbitrary it's laughable. Are you the sort asshole who needs to see it on the news to figure out the Pope's a catholic? etc After seeing what you have been up to butchering articles like a retard with a paper cutter, I pray to all things dark and evil that you will eventually fuck with one of this site's even worse self-important cunts.

 Hu12 administrator apparent libel and abuse 
Report to a Chair:

Hello, this is a request to review an apparently libelous and abusive comment made about a living person at the talk page for Mount Hood, done by administrator Hu12.  Toward the bottom at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Mount_Hood#Climbing_Records  

The issue stems from, as you'll see in the article's history section, my interest in adding a simple climbing record listing for Dan Howitt, with the press article references.

Hu12's post:
After going through the """"google results"""" (a disturbing education of sorts), there appears to be a long line of aliases for Dan Howitt, posting over various websites and forums promoting himself and besmirching the characters of fellow climbers and related. Appears this is an attempt to use wikipedia to import offsite conflicts and further an adjenda. It has been removed. I'd suggest that Dan Howitt  read the following, Wikipedia:Wikipedia is in the real world and Law Of Unintended ConsequencesHu12

My reply:
Please remove Hu12's Libel and Vandalism above and please report this user's abuse to Wikipedia administration. Also, Hu12 of the """"google results"""" you searched most are in support of Dan Howitt, with tons of his official summit photos on Rainier, Adams, Hood, Shasta, and listings of his timing officials. You strangely give weight to the abusive chat-site gossip and unsupported libel, and your own post above is of that nature. Chat-sites with this sort of conduct are sad. I'm reporting your libel and abuse to the wiki administration.Saffron1x (talk) 

Note Hu12 cites a link above as support for his allegations of Dan Howitt.  In reading the chat-site thread, and note it's a mere chat-site and has a lot of personal attacks, gossip, unfounded content, libel, etc, you will, nevertheless, find considerable support for Howitt including climbing record photos, timing officials names, etc.  Hu12 emphasizes the allegations about the use of aliases, and this is gossip and unsupported.""",0.0

I'm not sure the etymology of the word has much to do with it; the idea of religious police is pretty common on one level or another in almost all Islamic countries. It takes various forms depending on what the government decides to do, naturally; the more religious-theocratic the government, the more likely it'll be a full branch of the police or even its own group. Take its incarnation in Saudi Arabia and compare it to the village enforcement groups found in northern Pakistani villages, for instance. Or the versions in Egypt and Yemen, which have (at least at this point) more to do about making sure that the only version of Islam practiced is the state-sponsored one. Overall, the fact remains that MANY Islamic nations have religious police of some form or another, and leaving out the fact that it is NOT an institution unique to Saudi Arabia is inaccurate, as is claiming that it """"only"""" exists in Saudi Arabia and Iran.

The point is that the vowels in man and noun are raised in AusE according to Felicity Cox (2005), and the phonetic transcription for that IDEA example I gave you transcribes man as , and indeed it sounds like that to my ears, although that speaker did seem a bit broad.  It's not that uncommon for vowels to be raised before nasals.  Take for example the pin-pen merger in Southern American English and in southwestern Ireland or the non-phonemic æ-tensing that takes place in accents that have undergone the Northern cities vowel shift.  The only reason I brought this up is because I imagine it is very noticeable to English ears (it's even noticeable to my American ears).  Many English people might pronounce man as , which sounds quite a bit different from .  You're the Aussie here, so I'm sure you can verify this by simply contrasting your man with your bad (in this case both would have a long vowel, so try to listen for the quality of the vowels) or your noun with your loud.

PMK, first something personal - I think that I am familiar with a part of the problem. I have been in Gora (and I don't agree that they are Macedonians, Gora even is outside of the region of Macedonia), I have been in Reka, in Plasnica and Lisichani in Kichevo region (where the Turkish influence is very high) etc.
I can not accept your POV, that Pomak or other names are offensive. You should provide sources about this claim. However, let us imagine that these names are offensive - look the text in the article after Torbeš: (the latter name is slightly pejorative). What exactly is the problem to make such formulation for the other alternative names?
The term """"Pomak"""" is exonim for more of these communities. Pomak was accepted only from some Slavspeaking Muslims in Tikvesh and in Aegean Macedonoia, but now the biggest part these communities are displaced from the region of Macedonia. This was one of the reasons for my proposal for a compromise, when I added """"in historical context"""". However, I'll repeat that for all of three alternative names we have a serious scholar reference.
I think that it is good idea to add """"Apovci"""" as a regional name of one of this community.
If you have a relevant reference, that the term """"Tatars"""" has such status for Bulgarians (as Pomaks, Bulgarian Pomaks and Bulgarian Muslims for the object of this article), we can discuss it. We both know that the term """"Tatars"""" for Bulgarians is only propaganda, but if you'll find reliable sources for other uses of this term, we can examine them.

Reply from ColonelHenry
I have been pissed this week, I admit. Why?
 First, last week, I get harassed by one hypocritical """"rule nazi"""" editor taking things too far (SummerPhD) so when I pointed out her similar shortcomings and intransigence and said frankly """"this user is an asshole"""" and explain why and state """"this is the kind of user that drives editors away from wikipedia"""" I get blocked for 24-hours.  I say """"asshole"""" once, I get blocked.  She calls me a """"dick"""" over a dozen times, and gets warned.  Go figure. I hate nitpicking rule nazis because they end up proving themselves to be hypocrites, and unfortunately without fool other meek fools who tend to be admins tend to side with the rule nazi.
 In the midst of that Daniel Case continued to plow ahead insisting on a rushed revision of ALONJ that no one else raised as a concern (so, not immediately dire) after being asked first politely and respectfully several times to """"wait until after TFA"""" and he still ignored it.  If someone politely asked me to wait a few days before doing a drastic edit on an article they worked on that was getting a little attention, I would...because I find it akin to telling a concert pianist to change their entire concert programme an hour before the recital. Only when I responded in anger did he pull back on the reins and realize """"hey, maybe I should wait till after TFA.""""  A little deference on his part would have gone a long way.  I'm not averse to his edits, but seriously, after TFA would have been more than fine.  I considered it insulting, and his refusal to listen to a polite request stated by both myself and the other major contributor to the article was considerably disrespectful.
 And then when the article I've worked on becomes TFA we get inundated with constant vandalism and petty edits that were not necessary (i.e. people like you, Kevjonesin, insisting on 19th instead of nineteenth).  Is that really a necessary place to make a stand and pick a fight? Seriously, don't you have better things to do with your time?  I'd rather argue over an analysis of Hegel's influence on Nietzsche's """"Will to Power"""" or Hindu mysticism in Eliot's Four Quartets than bicker about things as meaningless as whether honour should be spelled -or or -our.

As for why, I like """"nineteenth"""" as opposed to 19th, several style guides (including Chicago/Turabian) advocates it, and growing up I was taught that all numbers under 20 should be spelled out. Whether cutting two dozen letters from an article going to 19th and 20th is going to make a difference for """"brevity's sake"""" on a 40-page article, is a lame claim and frankly a waste of time for both of us. I like the aesthetic of it spelled out, it's allowed, and the option of spelling it out is a bonus in an article to avoid confusion with too many other numbers.  When considering such an unnecessary subjective edit, deference should be made to style set by the editors who spent months on an article...and when nothing is wrong to it, deference is entirely warranted.  That isn't ownership, it's just courtesy and good judgment. After all, if I stood in your yard while you were painting your house gray and proceeded to insist you to paint your house orange, you'd tell me to """"kick rocks.""""

As far as I'm concerned, this is over. Move on. I am not addressing this any further, because nonsense like this keeps me from contributing and convinces me to leave Wikipedia again, and this time for good.

 One Buzzfeed article has suggested that this accolade has since been surpassed by Desperate Housewives. However, this claim has not appeared in any other mainstream publication and it has not been discussed by cast or crew of either series. While several of the main cast members of Desperate Housewives are female, two male actors, James Denton and Ricardo Antonio Chavira, have appeared in every episode of the series. In the title credits, the mixed-gender cast is credited together; in the first season, the series is billed as 'Starring Terri Hatcher', [et al], Steven Culp, Ricardo Antonio Chavira, [...] and James Denton'. By contrast, only female cast members, Holly Marie Combs and Alyssa Milano, have appeared in every episode of Charmed and have been credited as main cast members in every series. The introductory credits bill the series as 'Starring Shannen Doherty, Holly Marie Combs, and Alyssa Milano' (for seasons 1-3) or as 'Starring Alyssa Milano, Rose McGowan, and Holly Marie Combs as """"Piper""""' (seasons 4-8), followed by supporting and guest actors. While several published monographs, including the Handbook to Life in America by Rodney P. Carlisle (Rutgers University) and the Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World, have analysed Charmed as 'the longest-running show in history featuring female leads', no reference to this accolade in relation to Desperate Housewives has ever appeared in print. Aaron Spelling, Brad Kern, and the cast members, Milano, McGowan, and Combs, have all publicly recognized and discussed the accolade.

 Logic is a central area 
I quoted above from Syracuse University's web site  the """"four core areas of philosophy"""" that students must study are The History of Philosophy, Ethics and Moral Theory, Metaphysics and The Theory of Knowledge (Epistemology), and Logic. Now from Harvard University  basic required courses are an introductory course and one each from 1. Logic, 2. Contemporary metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy of science, philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, 3. Ethics, political philosophy, aesthetics, and 4. History of ancient, medieval, or modern pre-20th-century philosophy. Stanford University  basic required courses are an introductory course and one each from Logic, Philosophy of science, Moral and political philosophy, Metaphysics and epistemology, and History of philosophy. Major research universities seem to agree that all undergrad. phil. majors must take a logic course (and, incidentally, that metaphysics and epistemology can be lumped together at this level). While what undergrads. must take is hardly the be-all and end-all of phil., it certainly indicates to me that logic is a major area in the minds of academic philosophers. I also consider """"The Development of Logic"""" by Kneale and Kneale  to support this position; from pg. 1 it puts """"not simply valid argument but the reflection on principles of validity"""" in the context of Plato and Aristotle. (Of course they also discuss it in the context of math.) I contend that logic is a central area of phil. and merits conclusion alongside ethics and metaphysics/epistemology as the three major areas of phil.  """,0.0

Suggestions

(1) Might it be useful to """"update"""" Wittgenstein's contributions to various academic and philosophical inquiries? It seems that Wittgenstein's use of language games and place of language in experience has experienced something of a revival among some postmodern academics. 

In particular, his own transition from """"representational"""" to """"lived"""" semiotic is in itself interesting as a presage of the movement from a """"representational"""" to a """"community"""" derivation of language / meaning. 

I'm no Wittgenstein expert (just stumbled upon this interesting, if frustrating, discussion) and any credentials I might have had to the """"philosopher's club"""" have probably long expired, but a part of my doctoral work did float in and around meaning, words, classification and the uses we make of themvia semiotics. Thus I am eminently unqualified to write such a piece, though I can see a hole on the bookshelf where something like it might just fit. 

That is, philosophy did not end with Adorno, or even with Habermas. Some young buck out there, can you tell whether this connection (Wittgenstein's work on language and postmodern approaches to community-as-language) has developed at all in contemporary (21st century) philosophical work? 

Might be nice to see something pragmatic as well as historic. . .(of course they are not mutually exclusive. . .)

(2) On the issue of Wittgenstein's alleged personal quirks:

Given the absolute delight with which students of philosophy embrace all that is eccentric in the lives of the authors with whose works they are cursed to try and read (see Philosopher's Song. . .any campus)

and 

the somewhat unsettling popular idea that the most brilliant men (almost always men) are proportionately looney (perhaps explaining the less-brilliant lives of mostly normal people?) as well as

the difficulty of actually nailing down with precise sources most of what happened in Europe during either of the """"world wars,"""" but in particular the secondthere was an awful lot of bombing and burning by both sides

it might be difficult to come up with primary source material that would either confirm or deny even positions held forth in academic lectures but unpublished, let alone personal eccentricities (after all, if the people writing about these eccentricities were themselves brilliant, their own opinions of normalcy should be correspondingly suspect, see the """"it takes one to know one"""" argument)

So

perhaps we should cobble together a """"tribute"""" page to which all of the strange and probably unprovable and just as probably unimportant traits, stunts, personal traits, learned tricks and inept relationships of all such """"brilliant but eccentric"""" wiki subjects can point?

Thus the eccentricities (which, if not so important, are entertaining enough that folks will be motivated to search dilligently for evidence enough to warrant a smirk) can be acknowledged with a neat and proper cite through a proper point to another wikipedia page

but 

the """"eccentricities"""" page itself would be self-evidently immune from the precision of source usually required of biographies of thought, (by the way, why is it we assume that someone's date and place of birth is important to the formation of their intellectual ideas?) 

and would be a riotous read. (potentially Wiki's most commonly cited article)

This might satisfy both the """"biography of ideas"""" and the """"biography of real peoples behind the ideas"""" folks by allowing the hint or shadow of perhaps something utterly crazy to fall across the screen without an actual commission of the crime of citing one wack-o's account of another wack-o (non-traditional spelling intentional).

Paradoxically, this page might already exist, and merely lacks more """"slept with sheep but only within a platonic framework"""" entries in order to accumulate enough word-weight to produce a big enough ripple when it is dropped into the swimming pool of ideas. After all, it wouldn't probably be listed where any boring (and thus non-brilliant) person might expect. . .

 Spam? Where? 
You keep on mentioning that when 195.64.95.116 is linking to this webpage it is considered """"spam"""". You even see this to be reason to block this IP for a week(!). Please define what you think is spam, because where I come from his/her linking to this particular website is anything but spam. I happen to be a member of some mailinglists (yahoogroups actually) on which Julius has written an enormous amount of very good articles on MP3 and stuff relating to audio-engineering, in Dutch. Many of the info he, his cousin and/or some others have put on this particular site, I see no reason for them to be needing any more visitors to this webpage than it already has; there are no popups, not even google-ads on it, so really, get your act together: This has NOTHING to do with spam. In fact, when I looked into this IP-address you blocked, I found that it resolves to """"jult.net"""", not to jthz.com, and even though it might be used by Julius, who is also one of the creators of the page you regard as spam, I still don't see the connection to """"spam"""".
Being able to use your admin-tools does not mean you need to abuse people on Wikipedia. Grow up!  
Note that Julius is even one of the people behind blocking/fighting spam; see example here, so you better do your homework first.  

 Still the same threats from the jealous little man with the minority complex? 
I read this nazi-like threat on the talk-page for my IP-address;
I thought you quit. If you don't stop spamming the MP3 article with links to your own website I'm going to block you from editing.  

1. I quit what? I never started or ended anything.
2. It's not spam and it has never been spam (and you know it isn't, your beef is something else, I don't even know what it is). Links YOU left in there ARE spam though, but you seem to be blind to those, so I will remove them for you.
3. Our webpage reaches more than 200 audio-enthusiasts daily, because it is informative on the subject, and has been since 1997.
4. If you keep on threatening me in this ridiculously nazi-manner of yours, I will report your behavior to those in charge, and we'll see about you being able to block perfectly valid links from being on that page. On top of that I will annoy you where and however I possibly can without breaking the law, your stalkerlike behavior is quite sickening and needs to stop.

"Punti and Cantonese 

The term Cantonese is the result of poor transliteration in English. Canton is the English word for both Guangdong (province) and Guangzhou (provincial capital of Guangdong). When the word Canton is made into the English adjective Cantonese, it could mean Guangdongese and Guangzhouese. The language people commonly refer to as Cantonese is in fact Guangzhouese. Taishanese people speak Taishanese, a language that is unintelligible with Guangzhouese. Many Taishan people in China still do not speak or understand Guangzhouese. This is the norm in the whole of China concerning regional spoken languages. It is acceptable to say that Taishanese is one of the Guangdongese languages, but then so is Hakka. The conflict is thus not a conflict between a Cantonese (meaning Guangdongese) speaking people against a non-Cantonese speaking people as both peoples spoke Cantonese meaning Guangdongese, be it one spoke Taushanese and the other Hakka. Neither party could also be described as Cantonese (meaning Guangzhouese) speaking people as neither were Guangzhouese speakers at home.

If not about language differences, then what was the conflict about? The conflict was simply a conflict of economics. The Hakkas were seen as late comers who stole the show in a declining economy.",0.0

Speedy deletion of Kobus van Rensburg
 A tag has been placed on Kobus van Rensburg requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page that has been nominated for deletion (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. Lastly, please note that if the article does get deleted, you can contact one of these admins to request that a copy be emailed to you.   gabsadds """,0.0

 FISHERQUEEN ( Actually A TRASHY DUSTBIN ) IS BLOCKED IN LIFE FOREVER AND FOR LIFE INDEFINITELY 

 FISHERQUEEN IS ACTUALLY A TRASHY DUSTBIN WHO IS BLOCKED IN LIFE AND FOR LIFE INDEFINITELY

It can be so obviously seen that you have no life in reality and hence you carry on with editing pages on Wikipedia,which is another big joke, like you. In fact, it is jokers like you that make Wikipedia an unreliable piece of crap that the world laughs on. You thought you can block users who edit articles that are wrongly written to project a """"good"""" image like that C-grade item song sleaze actress Payal Rohatgi. On the account of hello5678, when I edited to write the truth, since I work with the media and knew the actual truth, you did what you knew best - to block accounts and even have the foolish audacity to write that it did not seem I was a journalist. Your block anyways went futile ( like all your remaining blocks on other users go, and future blocks will be going ) since as I had said, there are a million computers to comment and reply from. It just depends on my wish if I want to respond to idle losers like you and whether I have the time to do so. Once and for all, I am doing it this time, and won't remove time for worthless people like you again.
 
You had some advice on how I should spend my """"blocked time"""" by reading WP:Dispute pages on Wikipedia so that I have better ideas on dealing with disputes. Actually ,you need better ideas to deal with life. I am not foolish like you to spend any amount of my time bothering about rubbish written by stupid people like you who have no work in real life and spend days editing pages on Wikipedia/ Scribblebook that no one bothers to read. Some people are just unfortunate like you and 2over0. And if you are troubled by my calling that actress """"sleazy"""", then that's your problem. Cos that's the only work she has done and the press uses precisely that term while referencing her work. You also spoke about writing """"accurate"""" information on wikipedia. Ironic, when you don't even bother finding out what is accurate, and spend endless hours blocking, and acting admin as if it is an important position in your life. Oh wait, that may be the only position you probably have or will have ever in your unfortunate life.
 
Carry on with your scribble game. And if you feel threatened by media exposure, then that shows you knew you were wrong. It's only when people are wrong that they feel threatened. Pity your personality. Also, you ended by writing that """" it's clear you aren't a journalist, and have no means of carrying out your threat """" - LOL. Sad, that you lived in that illusion. For JOKERS like you who are totally idle,and who scribble away in virtual pages on Wiki-scribble-pedia, will obviously withdraw from the truth. You yourself have no idea at all if I am a journalist, and you write that it's clear that I am not. Well, you are also inane and a clown to fool yourself. I had all means, and the said article has already been published. I had NO TIME to let you know, since I am a busy person, unlike you and do not find time to come scribble on virtual pages that clowns like you , 2OVERO, 2/0, AKERANS, MANAGERARC, FISHERQUEEN (yeah, we named you again - Suck it up),  KURU etc. do all your life. You will find that information, depending on which Godforsaken part of the world you live in.  And like last time, you can go ahead and block me this time too. For , no one cares two hoots for your silly blocking games. We do have a life, unlike losers like you. Maybe its time for you to go fish in real life, so that you can come anywhere remotely close to having a life - LOL.
SO, LOSERQUEEN, GROW UP and GET A LIFE, You IDLE CLOWN OR ELSE, YOU WILL REMAIN A LOSER ALL YOUR LIFE. WHO CARES ANYWAY WHAT INANE, PUERILE LOSERS LIKE YOU DO IN THEIR LIVES. Cos all you know best is to play edit and block games on your scribblebook called wikipedia. Scribble on cos anyway no one cares and I most certainly don't. Time for you to go fishing then, LOSERQUEEN. And I wont bother to check any replies or anything else ever, cos I dont have time unlike Idle LOSERS like you, Loserqueen. You are no where near a queen, but certainly are a huge ,filled with trash, dustbin. Pity you, unfortunate daft-LOSER- DUSTBIN.

Nice Try

The Idea of wikipedia is to present facts, not your opinions about the incumbant Mayor or the attempted highjacking of the Democratic Party. Granted you have a problem with Mayor Longo, as you make this clear every time you open your mouth at the Council Meetings (which provide for great entertainment as you seem to enjoy making a fool of yourself). Your opinions on red light cameras are off base as your candidate has yet to come up with a better solution to raise funds to get us out of fiscal emergency. In fact, Mr Wagner has no plan at all except to claim he will stop forclosures in the city- this is a national problem that the federal government cant stop let alone the would be Mayor of Garfield Hts. Mr Wagner goes around telling people whatever they want to hear in order to get their votes. Including but not limited to offering political patronage jobs to anyone willing to support him. Mr Wagner has been long known for playing dirty tricks as well as insulting his peers and the Mayor himself. The recent theft of the name of the Democratic Party orchestrated by his stooges such as yourself and """"Mr Lamoron"""" can only serve to harm his popularity and candidacy. Your candidate refers to his opponent as an """"uneducated union thug"""" while he proves himself to be an overeducated fool. At a recent Council meeting you were heard uttering """"its on"""", what is? more foolish self serving antics directed at slandering the name of the official democratic candidate? While you do not have the courage to run for office you can only hope Wagner wins this election so he can offer your wife the position of Economic Development Director, as this has to be the only reason you would campaign for someone of his calibre. It doesnt take much to open a user page, unless your afraid of the response you will get by offering your support to a self serving looser  """,0.0

So here is a section, for discussions regarding the people on the mosaic and infobox simply to prevent another huge edit war from taking place. 

So, I have added Sultan Kudarat in favor of José María of Manila, since is he the only Philippine national hero from the Moro region. Additionally I have also added Said Basher albeit he is a national Islamic imam, in to accompany the existing Roman Catholic priests (San Pedro Calungsod and Francisca del Espíritu Santo Fuentes). This equalizes it, two Roman Catholics and two Muslims.

Your rules are not to be enforced according to a draconian, egregious methodology

I really didn't believe I could get caught, however, I did. I am deeply sorry to have the community distrust me again. I have taken a month to think about what I have done and I am sorry to have done this.

I didn't know of the rule then, however, I agree that I should have been blocked for the other user I used to help promote the project. Now looking forward, I want to come back and continue to expand numerous articles as I was doing. I had expanded two articles in one day, I also had another Selena fan helping me with the Amor Prohibido page. I was teaching him the ropes of Wikipedia. I don't mind being mentored, however, Robert is the only person who stood by me. The last two came and go. I will admit, that I have some maturing to do if not a lot... however, Wikipedia is a community of people coming together to create a comprehensive site for information.

I hope I can come back, I know that my English isn't the best even though I am a native speaker. Not everyone is perfect, and everyone has a strength... my strength is expanding Selena articles. While growing up with a family who had loved her before she was murdered and growing up with my mother who continued to play her songs, I grew to become very intelligent in Selena information.

Speedy deletion of Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Mantin
 A tag has been placed on Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Mantin requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section G12 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be a blatant copyright infringement. For legal reasons, we cannot accept copyrighted text or images borrowed from other web sites or printed material, and as a consequence, your addition will most likely be deleted. You may use external websites as a source of information, but not as a source of sentences. This part is crucial: say it in your own words.

If the external website belongs to you, and you want to allow Wikipedia to use the text — which means allowing other people to modify it — then you must include on the external site the statement """"I, (name), am the author of this article, (article name), and I release its content under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 and later."""" You might want to look at Wikipedia's policies and guidelines for more details, or ask a question here. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. ♠Dil  """,0.0

 criticism of jesus/plucking eyeballs out/slavery 

Jesus has been criticized as vindictive, intolerant, prudish, and unkind. Several scholars have noted that he appears to condone slavery.
 
−TABTAB 
−TAB
The cardinal Avery Robert Dulles stated that Jesus “said not a word against slavery as a social institution"""", and believes that the writers of the New Testament did not oppose slavery either.  In his paper published in Evangelical Quarterly, Kevin Giles notes that Jesus often encountered slavery, """"but not one word of criticism did the Lord utter against slavery,” and argues that Jesus must have then condoned it.  
 
−TABTAB 

How come the Catholic removed this section in his words """"because it didn't appear to be criticism"""" is this a joke?  
−TAB
Friedrich Nietsche argued that “a war was declared on passion” in the Sermon on the Mount, in which Jesus says of sexual temptation: """"If thy eye offend thee, pluck it out."""" According to Nietsche, “Destroying the passions and cravings, merely as a preventive measure against their stupidity and the unpleasant consequences of this stupidity, today this itself strikes us as merely another acute form of stupidity. We no longer admire dentists who """"pluck out"""" teeth so that they will not hurt any more…. the Christian who follows that advice and believes he has killed his sensuality is deceiving himself: it lives on in an uncanny vampire form and torments in repulsive disguises.”[Friedrich Nietzsche, 1878, Human all too Human: A Book for Free Spirits, The Wanderer and His Shado, aphorism 83] """,0.14285714285714285

Disgusted
No word can better describe how I feel about Wikipedia right now than """"disgusted"""".  I have deactivated all of my tools and bot tasks indefinitely, until such time that I decide how I'd like to proceed.  | yak _ 
Scotty, you are a great asset to wikipedia, and it would be a very large negative if you left,   
I agree fully!   
Concur.   
As do I. I appreciate that we haven't always got on, mostly in  rather than unofficial capacity, but as my comment on Drmies talkpage makes clear, I consider you one hell of an editor. I don't want to see you mocked or belittled for the sterling work you do, and I certainly don't want to see you leave.   
Scotty, I don't want to see you leave either, but what you said (about """"my entire existence"""") belittles my contributions in an unacceptable manner. I got fucking blocked for responding to your sneer, so eating some crow on your part is no more than fair, it seems to me.   
Drmies, come on. You guys just got blocked (and unblocked) for going at each other. Is it really necessary to keep poking? You both think you were justified, you both think the other wasn't, lets just let this die before it flares up again for round two.   
Fluffernutter, I don't think this needs mediation, thanks. Scotty is a big boy and so am I. We disagree over something, and we could have handled that very well, I suppose, until someone came in between and started throwing blocks about. Scotty, I'm sorry for what I said: you hurt my feelings and I let it be known. I'm not going to come back here since I don't want to bother you; you can always drop me a line on my talk page and you're welcome to leave a TB template as well, pace DNTR. Take it easy,   

Taking occasional breaks is healthy and encouraged. Just don't be a fucking diva about it, please. Editors have placed trust in you to be a reliable bot operator and tool maker.   
 Suggestion: replace that second sentence with """"But remember, """" for intended effect and best results.   
Believe me Scotty I know how you feel. I fell into the same trap this time last year for a much less and never recovered and I know you are familiar with that whole kerfuffle. I have gotten to the point now where I rarely edit article here anymore. The only difference is that I wasn't an admin. I hope you don't completely give up on this place like I did! I'm also glad someone had the good sense to undo the block.

But while I don't assume that Israeli soldiers never target civilians with intent, I likewise dont assume that they never do. I have seen too many videos of Israeli soldiers behaving in a brutal matter to Palestinians who are already on their knees with their hands up to think that it never happens.  And likewise I dont think that a pilot fires on a building with civilians knowing it is full of them and only them, but I dont that their superiors would never order it without their knowledge.  Atrocities happen, oftentimes unintentionally, others with full intent, like My Lai Massacre, Sabra and Shatila massacre for which high ranking officers were held at least indirectly responsible, and many others.

 South Korea started the war 

The events now taking place in Korea broke out on June 25 as the result of a provocative attack by the troops of the South Korean authorities on the frontier areas of the Korean People's Democratic Republic. This attack was the outcome of a premeditated plan.

From time to time Syngman Rhee himself and other representatives of the South Korean authorities had blurted out the fact that the South Korean Syngman Rhee clique had such a plan.

As long ago as October 7, 1949, Syngman Rhee, boasting of success in training his army, stated outright, in an interview given to an American United Press correspondent, that the South Korean Army could capture Pyongyang in the course of three days.

On October 31, 1949, Sin Sen Mo, Defence Minister of the Syngman Rhee Government, also told newspaper correspondents that the South Korean troops were strong enough to act and take Pyongyang within a few days. Only one week before the provocative attack of the South Korean troops on the frontier areas of the Korean People's Democratic Republic, Syngman Rhee said, in a speech on June 19 in the so-called """"National Assembly"""" where Mr. Dulles, adviser to the U.S. State Department, was present: """"If we cannot protect democracy in the cold war, we shall win in a hot war.""""

It is not difficult to understand that representatives of the South Korean authorities could only make such statements because they felt that they bad American support behind them. One month before the present developments in Korea, on May 19, 1950, Mr. Johnson, chief American administrator of aid to Korea, told the American Congress House of Representatives' Appropriations Committee that 100,000 officers and men of the South Korean Army, equipped with American weapons and trained by the American Military Mission, bad completed their preparations and could begin war at any time.

It is known that only a few days before the Korean events, the United States Defence Secretary, Mr. Johnson, the Chief of the General Staff of the United States Armed Forces, General Bradley, and the State Department adviser, Mr. Dulles, arrived in Japan and had special conferences with General MacArthur, and that afterwards Mr. Dulles visited South Korea and went to frontier areas on the 38th Parallel.

Only one week before the events-on June 19-Mr. Dulles, adviser to the State Department, declared in the above-mentioned """"National Assembly"""" of South Korea that the United States was ready to give all necessary moral and material support to South Korea which was fighting against Communism.

These facts speak for themselves and need no comment. . . .

The United States Government tries to justify armed intervention against Korea by alleging that it was undertaken on the authorisation of the Security Council. The falsity of such an allegation strikes the eye.

What really happened? It is known that the United States Government had started armed intervention in Korea before the Security Council was summoned to meet on June 27, without taking into consideration what decision the Security Council might take. Thus the United States Government confronted the United Nations Organisation with a fait accompli, with a violation of peace.

The Security Council merely rubber-stamped and back-dated the resolution proposed by the United States Government, approving the aggressive actions which this Government had undertaken. . . .

The illegal resolution of June 27, adopted by the Security Council under pressure from the United States Government, shows that the Security Council is acting, not as a body which is charged with the main responsibility for the maintenance of peace, but as a tool utilised by the ruling circles of the United States for unleashing war. This resolution of the Security Council constitutes a hostile act against peace.

If the Security Council valued the cause of peace, it should have attempted to reconcile the fighting sides in Korea before it adopted such a scandalous resolution. Only the Security Council and the United Nations Secretary-General could have done this. However, they did not make such an attempt, evidently knowing that such peaceful action contradicts the aggressors' plans.

""":It is neither more historically correct, nor more professional. Scholars routinely use the term """"Nazi"""". You cite the Encyclopedia Britannia as evidence of your claim. But, in fact, the Encyclopedia Britanica uses Nazi an order of magnitude more often than National Socialism. In the online version of the Encyclopedia, there are 10,200 references to Nazi and only 1020 references to """"National Socialism"""". And in the title of the entry for """"National Socialism"""", they write """"also called Nazism or Naziism"""". 

Your claim that use of the term """"Nazi"""" is amateurish is a slur on the overwhelming majority of scholars who routinely use the term. The claim that """"National Socialism"""" is a """"more full and correct designation"""" is inconsistent with the fact that the two phrases are synonymous. And while it is true that """"Nazi"""" can be used as an epithet, so can """"dog"""". Do you also recommend that Wikipedia refrain from using the word """"dog"""" to describe dogs? 

It is interesting that you use Linder as support for your argument. The particular passage that you link to is an explanation by Linder as to why he will use the term """"Nazi"""" rather than """"National Socialist"""" throughout his book. I fail to see why this is evidence that Wikipedia should do the opposite.

I am curious about your statement that use of the term Nazi arises from a deeper intent by political opponents to give a skewed view of their politics. What part of Nazi politics do you feel has been skewed by their political opponents?

"Agnes of Aquitaine 

Hey David.  If you have time for an article can you create one about Agnes of Aquitaine, the second wife of Ramiro I of Aragon and the daughter of William VI or VII of Aquitaine?  But you would have to be a little creative about naming her because there is already a Agnes of Aquitaine, Queen of Aragon and Navarre and a Agnes of Aquitaine, Queen of Aragon, and this Agnes' birth and death date are unknown.  
Just doing that.  I'm going to clean up the entire list.  
Just create a stub. Check Isabella of Urgel's article, it's as short as Agnes' article will be and she had a son who was king.  
Thanks David.  You did a fantabulous job. You probably should change the first paragraph to show how her indentity is disputed and how the indentity of her father is disputed between William VI and William VII.  
I don't know. I wish he'll take it less seriously, I mean I can't put any dates that are historically guessed.  He and Srnec are the same.  He seem to only altered Agnes' page but Ermesinda's page seems pretty intact with a few arrangement changes. BTW have you checked any of my new lists, you can check some out at Category:Lists of countesses, Category:Lists of duchesses, Category:Lists of princesses, and Category:Lists of queens.  
I moved it. As for Majorca, it'll be finished after I added the independent queen consorts.  Do you think another page should be created for Agnes of Aquitaine, Countess of Savoy since Agnes, wife of Ramiro I of Aragon isn't really even on both Agnes?  Agricolae removed all the children of the Savoyard Agnes of Aquitaine.  
Yeah I saw that connection of Bertha and Agnes, but we can't be sure if there were one or two Agnes.  We can just say how they may be the same person.  
I don't really care anymore, he must have been easedropping into our conversation.  I hate arguing because in the end I always lose. One bad thing about me is that I'm a pushover.  Well List of Majorcan consorts is done, in time I'll create another section for the titular queen consorts and another section for the Ladies of Balaguer.

In particular the three-revert rule states that making more than three reversions on a single page within a 24-hour period is almost always grounds for an immediate block. If you find yourself in an editing dispute, use the talk page to discuss controversial changes. Work towards wording and content that gains consensus among editors.

Card rule
Excuse me. I read the talk page. You said and I quote """"If the style is listed on a card as its own style when the routine is drawn or when the routine is announced, I treat it as its own style. If the label is only used in passing, it goes in the subsections."""" That's why I moved """"Pas de Deux"""" to it's own row because Katee and Will in season four (U.S. version) and  Melissa and Ade in season five (U.S. version) did a pas de duex; it was on the card. Wake up. I was following your guidance. Why would you change it? Why would you react negatively to edits that are consistent with the rule you made up. Speaking of rules, I don't know where you got this sense of entitlement from because you do not WP:OWN the page. I went along with it for the sake of consistency but you clearly don't care about that because you reneged on your own rule when you undid my edit. 

Categorization
Don't patronize me and say that you appreciate the attention I'm giving to the page because if you did you wouldn't have reverted all my edits. The changes I made were not subjective. African dance is not jazz. How the show presents dance versus this page being a primer on dance is a non sequiter. African dance comes from AFRICA, not from jazz dance. How in the world is that subjective? This is obvious. You changing it back to being from jazz dance is actually what's subjective. Funk is STREET. Do some research. Electric Boogie is not a separate sub-style of Electric Boogaloo. It's more like a nickname for Electric Boogaloo, i.e. Michael/Mike, Jennifer/Jenny. So I don't understand why you would list this as a sub-style/variant of Electric Boogaloo. To be completely honest """"Electric Boogie"""" is actually a song. People do the Electric Slide dance to the song """"Electric Boogie"""". Think about the laymen who are reading this page. Because of your suborness, they're going to walk away thinking it's actually a separate dance style when it's not. Nothing that I've said above is subjective. It's based on facts. How can you to call my changes ill-advised and subjective while at the same time claiming the content you added was implemented """"in such way that WP:OR and needless debates on what divides styles does not occur."""" Are you serious? The wikilinks I provided at the beginning of this paragraph has citations in those articles proving that what I'm saying is true. The dance styles table in this article has ZERO SOURCES. This is a classic example of WP:OR and a lack of WP:NPOV... and being subjective.""",0.0

Read the two sources given. They are very good biographies.

 Reply Dear you are right in your argument.

The User   Walkie-talkie is coming out with some crasy arguments that there is nothing even to discuss about the """"Terrorist category"""". I don’t know whether he is thinking Wikipedia should be monopolized by the fascist Sri Lankan killers who are some or other way marginalizing the Tamils in Sri Lanka since the independence. He is talking about commonsense. I don’t think so even he has an iota of that.

If Anton Balasingham could be named as the chief strategist and the chief negotiator or the apologist of one of the most barbaric terrorist groups, what about the following atrocities against Sri Lankan Tamils since the independence by the Sri Lankan State. 

          Genocide '83

TABSRI LANKA ACCUSED AT UNITED NATIONS

State Terrorism in Sri Lanka

If you go through the above incidents you will come to know they are many times worse than the highest number of suicide attacks which were targeted against innocent civilians by the LTTE.

I couldn’t understand what is the importance of that banning in 20 countries when hardly most of the countries civilians had not been killed by the LTTE attacks and the LTTE's activities are expanded into those countries only to the extent of fund raising from the expatriate Tamils.

He was the political adviser not the adviser to LTTE leader to carry out suicide attacks or to scheme military activities.

Composing the LTTE leader's annual speech or representing LTTE doesn’t qualify him for the """"Terrorist Tag"""" at all.

Why the talks failed every time was mainly the hardliners in the South and not by any of the Tamil groups or LTTE.

It is so stupid expecting he definitely knows all the crimes being carried out by the LTTE when he was utilised by the LTTE only at theoretical level and for negotiations.

I don’t know why that particular wikipedian feels sorry for him. For what?
Here anyone can comment independently and dragging a wikipedian to discuss with some other wikipedians is not acceptable. Then he can come out with his opinions here.

 The Treaty of Limerick 

It is sometimes forgotten, that with Sarsfield and the other """"Wild Geese"""" gone,and with the Treaty of Limerick broken, one of Western Europe's most savage bodies of legislation (with the possible exception of laws designed to persecute the Jews)collectively known as """"The Penal Laws,"""" was introduced, designed to reduce the Catholic Irish to a stte of abject misery. Any reputable historian of 18th century Ireland can be consulted and the worst horrors of that legislation examined! The repeal of the last of the Penal lawswas only completed in 1829, when the Catholic, Kerry barrister, Daniel O'Connell took his seat in the House of Commons (Catholic Liberation).

Also, the use of wiki voice to imply certainty regarding the reason for her arrest is inappropriate. I don't know why your not seeing that. Your third quote removes the unintended implication, but retains the unwarranted and somewhat offensive authoritative tone regarding the reason for her arrest.

As the coward has deleted my honorable challenge, restate it here:
Your insipid attempts to delete the l0de radio hour page disgust me, you miserable shell of a half-man. Consider yourself formally challenged to an honorable duel in international waters, which I have no doubt you will slink away from like the cowardly reptile you are. Without true conviction behind your statements, you do not even deserve to have a tongue, and I yearn for the days of old where speakers of untruth faced searing-tong glossectomy and abacination. Your furtive and manaical attempts to discredit those voting to keep exposes you as little more than a drooling ocd-riddled schizophrenic and I heartily encourage you to wash your hands and pick viciously at your many pustules and then wash your hands again until the vicious cycle exposes bare skull. The stove is on. DONGS. 
dongs
Response from coward begins:
Fine, I accept.  As challenged party, I have choice of weapons and conditions.  I chose pistols, and we will fight at a distance of 15 cm.  The fight will tak place in three weeks time 205m off the east coast of Newfoundland.  Acceptable?  30 June 2005 14:02 (UTC)
Response from coward ends.
dongs
As you are ignorant of even the most rudimentary conventions of honorable duelling it is my duty to inform you that it is the challenger, not the challenged who determines distance, as stated in rule #16 of the Codo Duello. You must also elaborate on the pistols to be used, otherwise I will assume any caliber semi-automatic is permissable. As you have chosen the grounds, you are also responsible for providing the boat on which the pistol duel will take place. If you are unable to find a boat with a large enough deck to accomodate an honorable duel (at least twenty paces of unobstructed space in a corridor ten feet wide) another option is that two smaller boats may be used, in calm seas. Inflatable rafts and non-motorized dingheys are not acceptable. I must commend you on selecting a cowardly weapon which greatly complicates the relatively straightforward process of an at-seas duel, you perfidious poltroon. Should you miraculously acquire vertabrae between now and the chosen date, I will gladly agree to a change in weapons, especially to epees. The time is acceptable to me. Please note that duels cannot take place within the jurisdiction of Canada, and therefore must take place at least 200 nautical miles (not standard miles) from the continental margin, to avoid breaking laws which expressly forbid dueling. 

I await the duel eagerly. Please offer my advance condolences to your family members.

 My Two Cents 

 Political correctness will be the end of our world as we know it. This is sad that political correctness has come to this level. It is causing our society to reward failure and condone criminal behavior. This is sad. We might as well change the constitution and exclude freedom of speech. This is next. Truly sad. Truly sad, indeed. 

 Also, regardless what you want to refer to the chinese as, china is the reason why the US's economy is in the crapper, and why our unemployment rate is higher than it has been since the early 1980's. We have made """"those people"""" rich while our economic infrastructure is crumbling. Open your eyes!

And for those reasons, I despise China as well as the politically correct.

 Niggardly 
It is apparent by reading wiki's page on the """"controversial"""" word """"niggardly"""", that stupid people and words do not mix. It has been said that most people never pick up a book after leaving high school. Proof of this exists in the fact that this word can be taken so blatantly out of definition, that persons are asking that it be banned from the English language. As I said, idiots and words can be a dangerous combination.

What is even sadder is that I expressed this comment on wiki's niggardly page, and was accused of vandalism, yet others posted similar comments. I must of hit a nerve with some """"idiots"""" who don't have a large understanding of the English language and it proper usage. LOL!""",0.2857142857142857
"""I disagree. The minority view in question regards the group of people to whom the term is being applied. You cannot use the 50% plus 1 whenever it is convenient. Minority views are also relevant, and in this case it is a matter of defining the subject by both sides. Please don't turn this around as if I was pushing for the ELF views on the lead of the vegetarianism article. You are the one who is pushing a POV. The FBI is not an authority on terrorism. They cannot define who is a terrorist. That is why we have guidelines such as wp:terrorist and the article on """"terrorist organizations"""" merely points to who classifies who, instead of categorizing through verifiable sources. There is not authority on terrorism, and your version of the article is totally unacceptable. Notable authors such as Noam Chomsky think that the state for whom the FBI works is terrorist and you don't see me pushing for such sort of classification.

 My Conrtibutions to Shady Records

 Alchemist 
Luis Resto
Rikanatti
Eminem also acts as a producer for the label, and since he is the founder, CEO, and signed to the label as its main artist, I would presume that linking references for him as a producer is frivalous and uneeded. 

Now, The Bass Brothers and Eminem have ended their working relationship. We have multible sources for this including when Em purchased his new studio, and F.B.T sued Interscope/Aftermath.

However, with that said, we have no additional proof that DJ Head has ended his working relationship with EM. We have no source saying that he has, and unless you supply one, we're going to be leaving him in the active section. Just because a producer didn't release any tracks for the label in a while does not constitute their absence from the label.

So Please, Let me re-add Alchemist, Eminem, Mr. Porter, Luis Resto, Rikanatti, and DJ Head to the production list, and let us move on with our lives. No need to keep pricking this crap in the butt.

Also, """"DJ Green Lantern"""" should not be under the """"former artist category."""" If you leave him there, you're going to have to add the other Producers/DJs onto said list when and if they leave the label.""",0.0

Still The Achilles' Heel of Wikipedia.

Maybe someone who checks in on this talk page might now where to go with it?

First, a public reply to Dragons flight, (and maybe his own sockpuppet """"Freestylefrappe""""):  Hardly a """"sockpuppet"""" when I used the very same name....  followed by a """"2"""".  Or are you talking about blocking Pgio """"too"""", who simply agreed that someone here is quite a J_rk?  I asked so clearly that you wouldn't take away WMC's opportunity to block me himself....  I would have been proud.  But you knew that too, right?

Wikipedians: I freely admit, that my own level of civility here has lowered....  even against my own admonishment to others to avoid such behavior.  All I can say, is that it is a VERY difficult dynamic to avoid when some here play by such despicably manipulative and base rules of engagement.  I'm thinking of that dichotomy between people who claim that their Ends or so worthy, that they should get a pass on their occasional stray from acceptable means, vs. those who retain some hold on the idea that they will be judged by their Means, no matter the final outcome.

This is made all the more difficult where users such as Admin WMC, who know full well the self imposed limits of their opponents, demand verbal civility on one hand, and yet play such extensive games of """"pretend to forget"""", """"I didn't see that"""" written ten times before, and ALWAYS selectively choose the lowest hanging fruit in a nest of specific challenges to their type of behavior, contributions, and edits.  

Worldly people understand the sensitive nature of situations like these.  Educated people (especially those through the School of Hard Knocks) know that these situations are more often set-ups, initiated by the manipulator.  The manipulator has at least learned the fine art of camouflage where they can hide very well 'in plain sight' flying the banner of Democracy.  Failing to acknowledge this simple possibility, marks one as either the manipulator, or just a pseudo-intellect.

As I've said before, and will say again....   If users like WMC were genuine, they'd acknowledge human fallibility and the basic rights of dissident opinion.  Doing so, WMC would quickly gain my support of his presentations on mainstream understanding.  He gets that part right VERY OFTEN and has demonstrated a tenacity to seeing his POV upheld.  Good for him, and why I have absolutely no trouble with his dominance over others trying to write articles presenting such information.  Yet why?  Why does he refuse to acknowledge his lack of verse in material outside of his very public field of knowledge?  Why does he go so far in his chilling drive to stifle the good faith presentations of non-mainstream fields?  

Please, I'm not just talking about aether theories alone.  The electric fields have plenty to say about corollary/causal dynamics in cogent presentations about a very possible relationship to atmospheric phenomenon.  Damn if WMC shouldn't be reading some of that stuff instead of JUST pointing out how it's counter to the formulas used in current Climate Models.  I mean, just forget about the LONG history of trial and repeated errors in aether postulation, the mysteries of electricity still surround us and we would all benefit by keeping an open mind about that.  

In the least, do we really think it wise to insist by near constant omission, any possibility that Birkeland or Alfvén currents effect our conductive atmosphere.  I'm not saying that WMC's models need to be trashed or even that he should modify them this afternoon, but it's highly suspicious that he suppresses the postulations and formulations from even the notable sources working on competitive modeling.  It is so suspicious, that is why I question his objectivity, and point out that he IS a PAID agent of tax dollars vested in a particular model. That he doesn't acknowledge and recuse himself, is just annoying to say the least.  That Wikipedia doesn't impose some boundaries on this user's blinding conflict of interest, casts a far greater doubt upon Wikipedia NPOV all together.  """,0.0

Why reiterate """"civil disorder""""?

The law already contains codes against """"civil disorder"""", so by saying """"enforce the law AND reduce civil disorder"""" one is reiterating the point. Why?.

Generally speaking, a personal site isn't accepted as the only mark of somebody's notability.  A lot of people have personal sites, and they aren't notable for it.  The best thing to do would be to find a couple of other sources about Hammond, talking about his project, and link those; newspaper articles work, as do gallery notices and exhibit reviews.

Nordic cinema
HI. These are exciting times are they not? What I had in mind two years ago on here seems to be gradually taking shape. The project is better and more organised than ever.

Who;d have ever though in the olden days we would have a half decent article on a] a 1911 film and b] a silent danish movie. If we can add such content en masse which are of s similar standard this project will devleop massively. Some day we'll have every notable film from every country, and up to a half decent standard (hopefully). I;m keen to encourage editors to edit Latin American film although this seems to be a sadly neglected part of films on here. I;ve proposed a new project but I doubt I'll get anybody to follow it as most interested editors are likely to be working on spanish wikipedia aside from the one or two film buffs we have on here.

To further elaborate:
Besides being inconsistent, your criteria are arbitrary.
And they are your criteria. You've got a serious problem with ownership of this article; it's very nice that you've done so much work on it, but if you want to enforce your own version on everyone else, Wikipedia is not the place to be publishing.
How ironic that you're complaining about me removing """"relevant cited information"""" (ie. one guy's opinion) from the introduction while you are at the same time removing relevant cited information from the body. Scholars describe it as a genre. That is enough.
You claim that adding this genre makes the list useless to the reader, but that's a very silly claim, because quite the opposite is true: suppressing genres because of the opinion of one writer (or really, because of the opinion of one editor) makes Wikipedia a less useful and trustworthy reference. In Rescue opera, we can go into detail about scholars' thoughts on its coherency as a genre, but the list structure of this article is not set up to deal with competing theories: Charlton's opinion that everyone else is wrong has no place here, and certainly not pride of place.
""""As already explained..."""" - that's rich. You pretend that there was some kind of consensus which I'm violating, when the talk archive you link consists of you, you, and more you; indeed, when Talk:Rescue opera contains more users supports its description as a genre.

I have been told, and have confirmed, that you removed the image referenced above, including the link to the article """"Hans Baruch.""""

I have made several unsuccessful attempts to send email to the appropriate authorities at Wikipedia notifying them that the photograph was taken by me and that I have always considered the image to be in the public domain. The photograph was taken by me well over 40 years
ago and Research Specialties has not existed since 1965.

I hereby release all rights to this image to be used by Wikipedia for any purpose whatsoever.

I would very much appreciate it if the image were restored to the biographical article as well as the image by itself.  This photograph is an essential part of the story of the development of the Robot Chemist.

Am I doing this correctly?  If not, would you please send me the correct methodology for accomplishing the requested restoration?

Thank you for any help you can give in this matter.

Siincerely,

Hans Baruch (ex CEO of Research Specialties Company)

 Appeal 

I think your treatment of me has been a little unfair. In 7th grade, I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn't do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area. An IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test.
My mother's boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer, but I've met lots of other engineers who aren't as good as me at physics, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it. I'm also pretty good at engineering. I don't have a degree, and other than physics I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan).
I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I've come across. Every question of existentialism which I've seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven't been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I've considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is.
Psychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there's no aspect of psychology which I don't have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud's theories.
I'm a good enough writer that I'm writing a book and so far everybody who's read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that's not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I've heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it.
I don't know if that will suffice as evidence that I'm intelligent. I'm done with it, though, because I'd rather defend my maturity, since it's what you've spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code.
I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn't just faking it, I'd even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions, it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them.
I don't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. I don't have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don't care what a person's fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don't have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that's not really an impressive moral, but it's unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things. I love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone.
I'm pretty much a pacifist. I've taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I'll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don't attack, I'll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don't fight back. I've therefore never had a rea",0.0

"Solutions and suggestions ... 

 asked for a third-party opinion, so here goes:
 This long-running discussion makes me think of a few things in general:
 Michael is a newby, so the wiki policy of don't bite the newbies seems to be relevant, and it looks like for the most part,  is sticking to that, apart from personal comments about Michael's English. I can relate to the fact that it is sometimes hard to figure out what someone's point is, and that may be what Kwami was trying to say about Michael, but I think it's out of line to say that someone's English is non-native, or that someone's knowledge of Arabic is similarly less than desirable. So my point on this one is this: stick to the point and leave personal comments out.
 Sometimes, discussions about articles and edits get pretty heated, even without personal comments. If you can't handle it, take a wikibreak. This is what I do, and it works for me.
 Divide up the topics for discussion - it makes it much easier for people to comment without having to read lots and lots of stuff they aren't interested in. For example, if I want to comment about /el/ and /ba'al/, where in that long discussion would I want to put my comment?
 I think one of the best things that can be done for this article is to divide it up. Put the meat of the Wadi al-Hol in an article by itself, and the Proto-Sinaitic script information in its own page. What remains of the Middle Bronze Age alphabets is a general summary of why these two are thought to be related, plus thumbnail sketches of the content of those two articles, with appropriate Main Article type links. I think this will focus the discussion. For example, if Colliss has written about one but not the other, all refutation and support of Colliss's arguments will be guided to the right discussion pages.
 This topic is one of many that has scholars screaming at each other. There are ways of summarizing the opposing arguments that allow casual readers to understand the controversy without getting information overload.
 In relation to both of these scripts, the article suffers from a dearth of citations, appropriate or otherwise. The various assertions are interesting and serve as a stepping-off point for finding the actual sources, so I would oppose the deletion of every single unsupported citation. After all, it was only a few years ago that Wikipedians started to insist on citations - before then, there was a whole lot of original research, some of which still persists without proper citations.
 I for one would like to know how many examples of these inscriptions have been found. From the current state of this article, it seems like there is only one of proto-Sinaitic (which was found in two locations, which can't be right) and that there are only two Wadi al-Hol inscriptions, which we can see in the illustration provided. There is also a citable reference in some National Geographic website about Semitic anti-snake inscriptions in part of Unas's tomb in Giza. Maybe that should have its own page, too, with an appropriate link.
 I don't buy this business about Arabic being irrelevant. It reminds me too much of how European researchers dismissed all Arabic scholarship about the Arabic language itself. However, any references to Arabic in an article on a topic from the Middle Bronze Age have to keep in mind the huge time difference. For example, the hamza was a much later development, so it sheds about as much light on Wadi al-Hol as the development of the letters J, V and W.
 I don't accept the table at all - the article is about an intermediate step that is not represented in the table. The table represents conjecture about connections between two known endpoints, Hieroglyphic and the Semitic alphabet (for lack of a better term). Besides, if the hypothesis is that the proto-Sinaitic script evolved from hieratic writing, then why is that script not represented in the table?
 I don't accept the business of naming these letters. Unless there is evidence to show that these symbols even had names at the time they were used, the names are anachronistic. If the names were in fact attested at a different time in a different script, the person promoting the use of the names has a big burden. In terms of Wikipedia, all we have to do is say that a particular citable scholar has made the connection, and if the connection is disputed, we can point to a citation that says that too. It is our own editorial discretion that says how we portray that dispute, for example,
 A says X, but others disagree, for example, B.
 It is not clear whether X is true, as claimed by A, or whether Y is true, as claimed by B.
 Scholars disagree on whether X is tr",0.0

I think that someone is being a little silly and saying that because one vegetarian did not eat grains, etc. it is necessary to define it as optional. I think that this is wrong, because:
Nobody claims that nuts and grains are not vegetable.
I have not heard anyone claim that a diet of nuts and seeds is non-vegetarian.
If we include this we would have to add lots of other exclusions, for example many Jains don't eat root vegetables, some Hindu groups avoid """"hot"""" ([[Guna|rajistic]) foods such as chili, pepper, mustard, etc.

Personally I'm not as it really seems like we're portraying Donohue's characterizations as valid. Give Donohue (which essentially is the Catholic League) credit as he is a seasoned p.r. and talk show veteran and seems to know what hot buttons to push and how. However if we are going to give him a platform I would feel better if we broke down the section into the major points with balancing statements so the readers can easily see the issues dissected and addressed. To me the section feels like a several-headed beast each adding a sentence onto the next with the net result of confusion. I suggest sections including one devoted to just the League's issues (if it's just them) so we don't infer because the League said X then Y happened. In my opinion Donohue speaks as if he's representing Catholics and is actually seen by many Catholics as an extremist (I'm not sure if right-wing is accurate) who's actually feeding anti-Catholicism by perpetuating stereotypes in pop culture arenas while ignoring concerns of mainstream Catholics. I may not be wording this in the best way but I think the gist is there. Benjiboi,0.0

[edit] Gundagai
Ms Gundagai, normally I would be thrilled to be the centre of so much attention (so far all your edits, except those to your userpage, have been devoted to me), but article talk pages are for discussing the article, not for making personal attacks on other users. If you wish to give me feedback, I would be most interested to read it. The appropriate place for such postings is my userpage, not article or project space.
If you truly object to editors """"fiddling...and inteferring with some else's words,"""" then you might want to consider whether Wikipedia is the right place for you. Every time you make an edit, you acknowledge acceptance that your edits may be edited any number of times by any number of people. At the bottom of each edit page is this statement: """"If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed by others, do not submit it.""""
I strongly caution you about continuing to make personal attacks on other users. The community condemns personal attacks, and should you choose to continue making them, it will result in further and longer range blocks. It's very easy to avoid such blocks by simply commenting on article content instead of editors. I'm sure we can all work together constructively and productively if we refrain from making comments about other users.
I am very pleased that you now have an account and I think this is a sign of good faith on your behalf. So thankyou for that. I hope we are able to get these issues resolved so you may be able to enjoy contributing to Wikipedia. Sarah Ewart (Talk) """"""",0.14285714285714285
"""

I think that one of the confounding issues is what to name what Einstein called """"spooky action at a distance."""" The idea of action involves the application of some force over some amount of time, and our ordinary idea of """"causing something"""" involves exerting force on some system to influence its behavior. But entanglement is exhibited without the lag that would be required were interactions at a velocity ≤ c, so something is going on that is not """"causal"""" in the usual sense. On the other hand, before one or the other entangled twin particles is measured, they both have the freedom or the potential to manifest either spin, and after one of them is measured and must manifest a spin then the other no longer has the freedom or potential to manifest any spin other than the opposite of the one that was first measured. So something has changed, and it strikes me as creating an intellectual smokescreen to say that there is only some kind of abstract """"correlation"""" involved. Like the """"collapse"""" of a wavefunction, we have no idea of what is going on or how to describe it. All we know is that it happens. It also strikes me as possibly significant that the time sequence may not be clear. From my frame of reference, electron A is observed first, and electron B is observed second. Someone else, in another frame of reference, may see electron B as being observed first and electron A as being observed second. There are also phenomena within the same frame of reference that we call retrocausal. We have no way of knowing that the discovery of the polarity of photon B at time T+n determines, retrocausally, the polarity of photon A at time T. If we say that these changes are not local, that must  (I think) mean that they are not local in space-time. So, in a sense, I end up arguing against my own discomfort with the idea that there is """"only"""" a correlation between the discovered states of any entangled twins. 

If you are finding what I just wrote confusing, imagine what the whole discussion will do to someone who has just heard an intriguing mention of quantum physics on TV and has come to Wikipedia for more information. We need to be very careful to make our vocabulary and explanations such that our article can be processed by such readers. Lack of appropriate words is a big challenge.  """,0.0

In fact you article was puclished in 1997 and does not refer to him as the current manage. Your second reference is for 2006 which is 2 years past the date of 2004 I reference and well into a 2 year family dispute. Bottom line is that all recorded material dating between 1989 and 2004 list Susan stein as manager and contact for bookings and all things related to Dana.

Finally in regards to BPAtterson (p)and(c)with release dates are stamped on all CD's and artwork.

You used this non-sequitur as your basis for reversion.  And to this day you are persisting in it.  Yet again another example of a huge logic disconnect that permeates this entire exchange.

As for the meta-discussion (the discussion about the discussion), Andy's revert was based upon his assessment that the issue needed to be discussed before such a change could be accepted.

"Actually Christmas Day isn't a Bank Holiday either.

When that act was passed, Good Friday and Christmas Day were already established as days of rest and Christian Worship and thus did not neet to be included in the Act.  Although there have been two additions to the Bank Holidays (New year's day and May Day) and two other changes (Whit Monday became fixed and August Bank holiday was moved to the end of August), Good Friday and Christmas day are still excluded.  It should be pointed out that since 1971, Bank Holidays are no longer a statutory provision, but are proclaimed annually by Royal Proclamation (that is the 6 other than Good Friday and Christmas Day).",0.0

Also, the contrast between Category 1 through 2 might be increased some, it's hard to tell the difference, though white vs. yellow is fine.

"""==Correct and True Etymology of English words """"Myth, Mythology""""==
Greek μυθολογια """"legend, storytelling"""" is derived from μυθος """"speech, thought, story, myth"""", itself of unknown origin. English mythology is in use since the 15th century, in the meaning """"an exposition of myths"""". The current meaning of """"body of myths"""" itself dates to 1781 (OED). The adjective mythical dates to 1678; English use of myth is later, first attested in 1830, in its original English meaning of """"untrue story"""":

""""These two stories are very good illustrations of the origin of myths, by means of which, even the most natural sentiment is traced to its cause in the circumstances of fabulous history."""" Westminster Review 12:44 (1830)

This is the earliest known usage of """"myth"""" in English. In case anyone didn't know, in 1830 English """"fabulous"""" doesn't mean """"wonderfully aesthetic"""", it is the adjectival form of """"fable"""", that is referring to a fantasy or fairytale.  In 1830 the term """"myth"""" was new, so it carries what we call a gloss, things """"by means of which even the most natural sentiment is traced to its cause in the circumstances of fabulous (i.e., fictional) history."""".  This was not only the original use of the word, but the original academic use of the word, note the source, Westminster Review. That is still the way most all people define """"myth"""" today.  It's for reasons like this, that Wikipedia is so notorious for its mental disconnect with mainstream thought, and its enforced use of its own internal terminology / jargon, or to put it less nicely, doublespeak.  (ውይይት) 

In 2005, a single-purpose account added """"mythology categories"""" to a wide range of articles including Death and Resurrection of Jesus, Virgin Birth, and Transubstantiation, creating a huge uproar.  The outcome of the discussions then was overwhelmingly to reject the categories as imflammatory and inappropriate.  It was agreed at that time that theological and scriptural articles do not fall into the category of """"mythology"""" and today, none of these articles are so categorised, apart from Noah's Ark.  

Just last month, WP:RELIGION undertook to move the article """"Yoruba mythology"""" to Yoruba religion.  This is because the term """"mythology"""" is held to be demeaning, because Yoruba religion is still practised today, and the Yoruba who practice it constitute a significant viewpoint.    It is indeed regrettable that so much resistance is facing the prospect of extending the same consideration to the canonical Book of Genesis.  The Churches have drawn the line by indicating which books they consider canonical, inspired texts.  Genesis is among them with no exceptions as far as I know. What gives Wikipedia the right to draw the line so as to exclude other Biblical Books from """"mythology"""", but include the stories of Genesis?  No books that are considered sacred scripture by ANY large religion of today should be portrayed as """"mythology"""".  That's simple common sense.  We shouldn't call the Quran """"mythology"""" either, we shouldn't call anyone's sacred books widely adhered to today """"mythology"""".    (ውይይት) 

Now things like Hesiod and Orpheus are another story, I think the reason Hesiod and Orpheus have conventionally been referred to as """"mythology"""" for some time is because no significant numbers of people have ever come forward claiming to believe these books to be historical or literally true since the year 400.  At least I will go out on a limb and say I don't know of any, not a single one. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it's pretty safe to say they have been discarded, and nobody objects to the conventional use of """"mythology"""" for these.  But please realize that this is not the case with Christian, Muslim or Bahai writings, nor indeed the writings of many other living religions.  (ውይይት)

 Edit #2 (Fixed outdated EULA info.) No you didn't. You changed the link from Microsoft Safety Scanner EULA to Microsoft Security Essentials EULA which is blatantly wrong. The EULA links is working perfecting.
 Edit #3 (Fixed references list (was split into references/further reading), checked every URL and updated access date.) Well, this edit is in violation of Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Layout which says it must be split into two section. Besides, you also removed archive link and quotation, which hampers Verification.
 Edit #4 (Removed Notes section. Wikipedia is not a tutorial on how to use Microsoft webpages.) Wikipedia requires verifiability and everything that helps verify info and locate them is more than welcome. Your edit deters verifiability.

 A violation of wiki rules 

Apparantley I have made a mistake called WP:OUTING in regards to sockpuppet user 86.40.192.203 whom had begun a discussion on the admin board against me with false charges. this sockpuppet had done this previously saying he was not a sock - yet again he oppened a second admin section against me with a new sock saying that he was someone different yet he was clearly the same guy (lying and saying he was a new editor)

i say in no uncertain terms that i had never heard of WP:OUTING and am sorry if i have violated this policy - but i should also say that all the information i posted i got from his own prior vandalism - essentially he outed himself - he vandalized a page to give his name and date of birth - which got reverted by another editor because it had nothing to do with the article he was vandalizing - his location i got from the wiki's own traceroute function that i thought we were allowed to use to prove sockpuppetrty68.231.15.56  

in one of his sockpuppet attacks here Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents#User talk:68.231.15.56 he states that """"This person has only recently been reported."""" this sentence implies that SOMEONEELSE reported me and yet the IP of the previous reporter is 86.40.107.69 which traces to the same location in Ireland - this is by definition sockpuppetry or the use of various IP's to do malicious intent without acknowledement of ownership68.231.15.56  
myself i have used this same IP for over 5,000 edits whereas i can see a pattern of daily vandalism and sockpuppetry of the 86.40 IP as far back as 2008 (man thats a lot of vandalism) endlessly ANON changing his IP to avoid block which i am betting he is already long ago blocked administratively68.231.15.56

 RFA Co-nominations 

I am about to nominate an editor for the bucket.  What is the proper way to solicit co-nominators? /(talk)/(contribs)/(e-mail) 
You can ask the candidate if there is somebody they want to have co-nominate them, or you can approach the other party directly and simply say, """"I'm thinking about nominating USER:XXX, what are your thoughts about a co-nom?""""  You might be interested in my essay on how to nominate people, you can find it on my user page.-' PoppaBalloon 
Yes, what Balloon popper man said. You want users who are familiar with the candidate and/or the RFA process. I'd suggest no more than one nom and two conoms (3 total) as some will object if there are lots of conoms. —  • Talk •  
I've come to see 2 total noms as the proper amount.  One nom doesn't always give me the sense that the candidate has been vetted while 3 is starting to get to be too many.-' PoppaBalloon 
Oh yeah, one thing that I LOVE to see in candidates, is if I approach the candidate and suddenly a bunch of people I know and respect starting adding """"I want to co-nom"""" before the candidate even has a chance to respond.  When I see that, I feel that I've found a good candidate.-'''[[User:Balloonman|Balloonman]",0.0

I honestly believe, and I've said this before, that there is a way of resolving this question. And the reason I believe it is because I believe that there has been a big misunderstanding about who Christopher Michael Langan is, and what he stands for. I would like to make two points.
To be an advocate of something means to advocate for it. That is, it means to argue for it publicly. (One could be a private advocate around the dinner table, I suppose, but to argue this in an encyclopaedia would need very good evidence.) So, if somebody is an advocate, there should be clear evidence that he advocates the thing of which he is an advocate. Being an advocate means something different from, and something more than, being a member of an organisation. If it has been so difficult to find the clear evidence Langan advocates ID, that should give editors pause for thought, even those editors ill-disposed to the man.
I believe the reason this evidence has been so difficult to locate is because Langan is not an advocate of ID. He is just not an advocatory kind of guy, if I may be permitted to put it like that. He is a very individual, probably very self-preoccupied sort of person. Contrary to how he has been presented, my impression is that he is anything but a self-promoter. He certainly is a guy who seems confident he is right about what he thinks, and would like people to listen to him. But that is not the same thing as being a self-promoter. More importantly, he comes across as somebody who is not at all interested in joining political movements, and is, in general, not a """"joiner"""" of any kind. I truly believe that, as a guy totally outside academia, he was happy to receive the offer to speak at the ID conference, and could see grounds whereby what he had to say pertained to the interests of ID proponents. And the ID proponents, for their part, and as anti-ID people must surely recognise, are happy to accept into their fold anybody who seems like they could help the cause. So it was, if you like, a man and a movement taking mutual advantage of each other. Additionally, and as I have argued many times now, Langan's CTMU is disqualified from being a species of ID theory, because it explicitly disavows scientific proof, the very opposite of ID theory, which constantly tries to claim scientific testability. Langan, I honestly believe, is just not the kind of guy he has been taken for by anti-ID editors. And that is probably why the evidence just does not seem to be there.  """,0.0

 The criticism section is fundamentally and appallingly flawed. 

The criticism section is fundamentally and appallingly flawed. For example, it starts off by quoting (and uses heavily throughout) the white supremacist Tomislav Sunić, who other people may think of as a reliable source, but I most certainly do not. Here are his thoughts on Jews.  I hope you have a stronger stomach for that filth than I do - I stopped reading about halfway down. More about Sunić: """"In June 2008, the group hosted Tomislav Sunic, a former Croatian diplomat and the author of the anti-Semitic book Homo Americanus: Child of the Post-Modern Age, which argues that """"Americanism,"""" heavily influenced by Judaism, undermines traditional European morality.  """"On June 24, about 40 people attended a talk by Pacifica Forum speaker Tomislav Sunic, who only three days earlier had addressed the white supremacist Council of Conservative Citizens (CCC) at its national """"leadership conference"""" in Sheffield, Ala. Sunic, a writer and white nationalist, had previously spoken to the Washington D.C.-area chapter of the CCC and the Institute for Historical Review (at least twice). He appeared on the """"Political Cesspool,"""" a white nationalist radio show, and was interviewed extensively for David Duke's Internet radio program. Sunic and the former Klan boss (whose latest book is entitled Jewish Supremacism: My Awakening to the Jewish Question) commiserated about Jewish domination, low birth rates among people of European ancestry and discrimination against whites. """"Especially in these multiracial cities, like L.A. or Washington D.C., I'm losing my eye contact,"""" Sunic confessed to Duke. """"I'm sort of afraid even of raising my head and looking at people right in their eyes because I know they may not be of my species."""" .

The criticism section also relies heavily on Rummel, about whom we should maintain a high degree of scepticism. To quote Tomislav Dulić, """"the estimates used by Rummel for Tito’s Yugoslavia cannot be relied upon, since they are largely based on hearsay and unscholarly claims frequently made by highly biased authors"""". .

It then goes on to say that """"The Commission on Concealed Mass Graves in Slovenia, an office of the Slovenian Government whose task is to find and document mass grave sites from the Second World War and the period immediately after it, discovered at least 581 mass graves in the Slovenian territories [65] which “are believed to hold up to 100,000 bodies”[66] killed under Tito's government"""". None of this is true. The CCMGS has compiled a list of 581 sites which it believes worthy of inspection under the terms of its mandate. It has investigated just a few of these, and even where it has started to investigate, progress has been slow to say the least. For example, at Tezno, 1,179 bodies were discovered in 1999 (despite the wild speculation by the likes of Dežman and Ferenc about 15,000 bodies, so eagerly reported in the media), and at Barbara rov 300 bodies. That is not to say how many bodies will eventually be found - nobody knows - but what the article currently says is absolutely untrue. 

Finally, it gives mention to Bernard Meares, of whom I have no criticism - I'm sure he's a fine man - but is he the best you can do? He """"has lived in Trieste for some years, as a translator of the CERN Institute of Geneva"""".  Wow.

 Whole Ariticle Needs to br Rewritten 

i believe this whole article needs to be rewritten fromntop to bottom.  In jumps around in a chronological sense, thereby notbshowingbin a cohesive way how improvisational theatre has developed.  There is a lot of text devoted to thevwork of Keith Jonstone, but his work is no more important than dozens of other writers; moreover, his importance is no where near as significant in the US as is the work of Spolin, Shepherd, Sills, and Close (and the rolenof IO and The Second City.

The article, in it's present form, looks like a hodge-podge of sentences and paragraphs from many authors with no attention paid to consistency.

A rewrite would also avoid some duplication.

How does one initiate such a process?  Who selects the person to take the first stab at it?  I would propose that Michael Golding of Los Angeles do the rewrite.  He has a masters degree in improvisation from NYU, personally knows many of the people who have created modern improvisational theatre (Shepherd, Sills, Close, Halpern to name a few), and is a professional writer (his latest credit is for writing the film """"David Shepherd: A Lifetime of Improvisational Theatre"""").

On the subject of the proposed merge with ancient egyptian multiplication, the two techniques, while relying on the same fundemental mathematical principal, are very different in practice. These multiplication schemes are specifically about practice, not theory. The people that use/used these techniques use them empirically.

The text added in the article translates this entry as: In an ecclesiastical entry .... noted that some of the Christian Greek clergy had linguistic difficulties in administrating to their congregation, as Christian villagers living within the region of Delvinë were Albanian speaking.

It's hardly enough from the original text to conclude that the villagers were in general monolinguals, indeed it claims that Albanian speech was present and in significant numbers (it doesn't also conclude that all villages were Albanian speaking). Moreover, the fact that this produced linguistic difficulties in eclessiastical administration is something that only indirectly can be concluded, since the Codex mentions that """"a specific bishop, who came from Smyrna, found it not pleasant to hear his flock speaking Albanian, beacause of the Albanian speaking villages in  his periphery, and resigned after 25 years of local service.""""

Wikipedia sued for ‘aiding neo-Nazis’
December 7, 2007 - 11:14AM

A left-wing German politician has filed charges against online encyclopaedia Wikipedia for promoting the use of banned Nazi symbols in Germany.

Katina Schubert, a deputy leader of the Left party, said she had filed the charge with Berlin police on the grounds that Wikipedia’s German language site contained too much Nazi symbolism, particularly an article on the Hitler Youth movement.

“The extent and frequency of the symbols on it goes beyond what is needed for documentation and political education, in my view,” she told Reuters. “This isn’t about restricting freedom of opinion, it’s about examining what the limits are.”

Schubert said she had taken legal advice before making her move, and that she hoped it would encourage public debate on how far internet platforms should be allowed to aid proponents of extremist, anti-semitic and racist ideologies.

“There are signs neo-Nazis are trying to take advantage of such structures, and this needs to be stopped in good time,” Schubert said. “Especially given that Wikipedia is too important to jeopardise as an open and self-regulating project.”

A spokesman for Wikimedia Deutschland, an organisation that promotes the internet lexicon in Germany, rejected the charge.

“We don’t really know what Ms Schubert’s problem is,” Arne Klempert, managing director of Wikimedia Deutschland, told Reuters. “What’s important is the context the symbols are used in, and here it’s quite clearly education and documentation.”

“Anyone who tries to prevent the Nazi period being documented properly has a strange understanding of the world, in my view,” Klempert said. “Because that’s the best weapon there is (to prevent) something like that from happening again.”

Public display of Nazi symbols is illegal in Germany, but they can be used for educational and artistic purposes.

Schubert also came under fire from party colleagues.

“Katina Schubert fails to grasp the self-regulating mechanisms that work in Wikipedia,” Heiko Hilker, a Left party media expert in Saxony’s state parliament, said in a statement.

“Right-wing extremism on the World Wide Web cannot be tackled via national criminal proceedings,” he added.

Schubert said police would pass on the charge to state prosecutors, who would decide whether to open an investigation.

Klempert said Wikipedia’s structure, which enables internet users to discuss and edit content, ensured no bias arose. “Particularly on subjects like the Hitler Youth, you can be sure it would be changed in seconds if it did (show bias),” he said.

The Hitler Youth was the Nazis’ official youth organisation.

 Re: Justification for comment left which took the piss out of everything to do with your faith it seems

Well, that was longer than I anticipated for a title. Oh well. Anyway, do you think I am an arrogant, 'shithead' by reading that? or just a tad 'rant'headed?

Sorry, but your comment was abusive to me aswell, mate. 'I think you should tell him how to treat people'. Okay, I might of took the piss out of some person and I don't know if I did the 'christian' """"faith"""" aswell, I can't remeber to be honest.

But anyway, Justification...I am nice anyhow, but do get pissed. When I get pissed off with people, I get nasty. I was reading Aristophanes earlier that day (thats why it was in a poem). And all my poems have Underlying critical elements or 'praise' in them. You got the 'abusive tone' of the poem, but probably not the underlying bit. Or by the reaction of the first, you be deeply off the scale. I wonder what I said what made the 'christians' came into factor...I really can't remeber. Dam should've saved it. 

About the 'tell him that capps are for shotuing on the internet', I know that all ready. I used it for something called 'emphasis, may of heard it. Also, I was FUCKING PISSED AT THE TIME SO YOU DO FUCKING SHOUT AND SWEAR. don't you? yep...if you don't, your not human...well the swearing part you can reframe from. But your a man, so swearing is allowed. Only women where you say 'sorry for my french' (again justification, I am english that is a phrase over here > i am not just digging at the french)

So, yeah...I was on a rant for a bit...won't happen again. Unless a person is abusive to me. THEN HE WILL DIE. well not die...just lightly peotically abused...THEN HE WILL DIE...no stop with the killing? see I am mad sometimes...I am actually a comedian...so I don't take anything seriously. maybe I should...bombs away dude.

Umm - I'm not exactly """"promoting"""" him.  I'm a Democrat, and I voted for Gore.  But the consensus of several users - in fact, EVERY user except you - was very clearly in favor of the quote being removed from the introduction.  The quote provides no context, is blatantly POV, not to mention terribly inaccurate and silly, considering what actually happened with the election fraud (see http://www.commondreams.org/views04/1104-36.htm) and the fact that Gore actually won anyway.  So how did he make Dubyah the president?  Yes, I'm aware that's the first thing many people think of when they see him, just as the first thing many people think of when they see Mama Cass is that she died choking on a ham sandwich.  This, like the quote, is not true at all, but merely an ill-researched fallacy.  Does this mean we should write in Cass' introduction that she is best known for having choked on a ham sandwich?  No, because it simply isn't factually based or accurate at all. Even if it was accurate, it still wouldn't be appropriate for the introduction as it provides no context. Pretend you are someone who didn't know anything about him, and you saw this quote that he """"made George W. Bush the president""""-what would that mean? Is he the magical fairy who goes around granting wishes and making people president with his magical fairy wand from Lollypopland? You need to provide context and a detailed account of what actually happened before you provide such a glib, not to mention factually inaccurate, summary. As I said before, I've reviewed Toes+umbrellas chacha's edits, and none of them appear to be vandalism, but a pretty good faith attempt at removing something which not only constitutes a huge violation of NPOV policy, but also violates the consensus as reached on this talk page months ago.  So again, I don't know what your point is about that user being banned, when the offense seems to be only the fact that they removed vandalism well over 3 times.  To me, your offenses of violation of NPOV, violating consensus when no one agrees with you, and editing other user's sigs seem a twinkle more extreme than theirs.  I invite everyone to look at the comments that Griot left on Astruc's talk page wherein he revealed his very clear bias on this issue-he accused Nader of being a """"Maoist""""-and he is clearly just using Wikipedia as his own personal coloring book to slander him in violation of NPOV policy, and in violation of an irrefutable consensus on this issue.

"Response to James B Watson 

Thank you for your reply.
 
Your response confirms to me that you have obviously sided with the other users who attacked me. Perhaps Users such as Blixx are good friends of yours. Given this then it is impossible for me to get treated fairly as you are apparently biased towards them. I find it astounding that you have gone to great lengths to supress my views by blocking me from editing, blocking me from contacting the head as well as yourself and for added measure you have blocked me from emailing. All because I complained about my treatment, lets face it the excuse about me edit warring is just a smokescreen, you just don't like it when I diagree with a point of view. Are you following the orders of Blixx and co? Yet you make no mention of their personal attacks and abuse on me - they have called me 'a nasty piece of work', 'an islamist', 'Haddad's puppet' etc. Have you even warned them? I think not. So its ok for them to make personal attacks on me but when I criticise Blixx and co I get punished. One rule for one and one rule for another eh?

Okay, well. First, ufowatchdog.com does not seem like a reliable source. Wiki policy states that trustworthy secondary and tertiary sources are to be used - things like newspapers and books. Primary sources are discouraged, as are self-published sources (see WP:SPS) which is what ufowatchdog.com is, more or less. I looked around, and the only place I can find it being cited is on Richard C. Hoagland, and that's only for a comment on a radio show. As for the section on Linda Moulton Howe, I believe that section is entirely inappropriate. It suffers from WP:OR and WP:POV, but that's beyond the issue here.
I'm still confused as to what you want, though. Is it your belief that ufowatchdog should be used on all the pages, or none? Third opinions will only help here if there's been a discussion between you and another editor, and you need a third party opinion. —  [ t · c ] """,0.0

"""

Observation duly noted, with this response...

It isn't just that """"elements"""" of French's affidavit is based on other people's stories,  the fact is he swore that """"all facts and statements contained in this affidavit are true and correct.""""  And that included second and third-hand gossip about Kerry's military record in Vietnam.  This guy is  an officer of the court; I find it hard to believe he didn't know what he was doing. 

As to his claim about Kerry lying on MTP in 1971 about his unit being engaged in """"atrocities,"""" let's consider what Kerry actually said:

 SEN. KERRY: There are all kinds of atrocities, and I would have to say that, yes, yes, I committed the same kind of atrocities as thousands of other soldiers have committed in that  I took part in shootings in free fire zones. I conducted harassment and interdiction fire. I used 50 calibre machine guns, which we were granted and ordered to use, which were our only weapon against people. I took part in search and destroy missions, in the burning of villages.  All of this is contrary to the laws of warfare, all of this is contrary to the Geneva Conventions and all of this is ordered as a matter of written established policy by the government of the United States from the top down. And I believe that the men who designed these, the men who designed the free fire zone, the men who ordered us, the men who signed off the air raid strike areas, I think these men, by the letter of the law, the same letter of the law that tried Lieutenant Calley, are war criminals.   

Those sorts of things took place, and were documented as taking place - and in fact were mostly SOP. Even SBVT member William Garlow found  Hoffmann's tactics distasteful . French is not being truthful, or is at best being disingenuous if he simply doesn't think these things should be referred to as """"atrocities,"""" a term that Kerry was quite clear in qualifying. 

And compare French's description of Kerry's """"mutiny"""" remark with what he actually said:

 The fact of the matter is that the members of Coastal Division 11 and Coastal Division 13 when I was in Vietnam were fighting the policy very, very hard, to the point that many of the members were refusing to carry out orders on some of their missions; to the point where the crews started to in fact mutiny, say, """"I would not go back on the rivers again"""" ... 

A little different from claiming that he said """"crews at An Thoi were involved in amutiny,"""" isn't it?  We know for a fact that there was plenty of disgruntlement over SEALORDS policies (read Brinkley, for instance), and officers did refuse to carry out some of Hoffmann's orders .  Is Al French prepared to say no crewmembers ever refused to go back up certain rivers or on particularly foolhardy missions?  We know for a fact the lack of air support was so bad that RF/PF forces  refused to go on patrols without helicopter support.   French is knocking down his own strawman.

I think there's plenty to question in the other affidavits, especially Elliott's and Letson's, but again, I have no problem including them alongside all the other interviews and accountings in the reference section.   """,0.0

"""
Sorry to disagree again, but the article in question clearly puts the story forth as what each side says. (Narconon says drugs can be sweated out, doctors say no, etc.) How Dr. Touretzky took the story is not actually relevant, more on that at the end.
There are four basic """"sides"""" depicted in it, on one side Narconon and Scientology on the opposite Science and Ex-members/critics. The stuff on Touretzky's site is supported by the latter, and disputed by the former. To a neutral observer, like the Chronicle, it's a subject of controversy. (That's what ChrisO was saying.)
To explain why Dr. Touretzky's opinion of the story is irrelevant, I'll compare it to a reverse hypothetical situation; lets say Narconon felt that they had been quoted out of context. Both arguments are equally invalid since a paper isn't expected to publish what the subject wants published. (Actually, it's really similar to the lawsuit Barbara Schwarz filed against the Salt Lake City Tribune when they published her story and interview.)  

 On POV expressed in this and related articles on Wikipedia 

Incidentally, this article is an excellent example of the best case scenario of POV in a CoS/Hubbard article. It presents both sides arguments without additional comment by the paper, but unlike the Narconon/CoS claims, proof exists to back the assertions made by science. For example *Narco/tology's belief that all drugs have long longevity in fat, scrambling of 3D pictures, etc. compared to tests on human fat showing otherwise and the 3D picture theory to be unproven.
*Narconon and Scientology are for the purposes of the US Government separate entities and this abbreviation is not meant to imply otherwise. They do however share similar vocabulary and ideas, and when describing these I have chosen to abbreviate.  """,0.0

1. Jimbo Wales has to leave. He should turn over the server admin passwords to a professional, 
responsible IT person who is salaried by the WMF.
 
2. Said IT professional has to make some major changes to the MediaWiki system currently hosting WP. 
Changes would include but not be limited to:

   a. BLPs must be heavily restricted and protected, or better yet, removed entirely.

   b. A proper set of guidelines for editing and administration should be enacted AND ADHERED TO. 
      This would include limitations on the powers of all administrators, and requirements for editors to be
      personally responsible for whatever they do on the wiki. No more IP-address editing. Anyone seeking
      to write for WP must apply and be approved. NO PERSONS UNDER THE AGE OF 18. """"Assume good faith"""" my ass.

   c. ALL administrators must be elected by OPEN BALLOT, by the editors whose work they oversee.

3. Most critical to the project's success: certain untrustworthy administrators MUST BE REMOVED and 
banned from WP PERMANENTLY. This would include but not be limited to:
    FT2
    Durova
    David Gerard
    JzG

Your block anyways went futile ( like all your remaining blocks on other users go, and future blocks will be going ) since as I had said, there are a million computers to comment and reply from. It just depends on my wish if I want to respond to idle losers like you and whether I have the time to do so.

Heh, I guess I jumped right in. Anyway, I find two logical flaws in your argument. First: just because some Bulgarian editors may be misinterpreting or abusing the category system, why should we? Second: what if every article were subjected to your line of thinking? For instance, what if someone decided that Category:Communes in Cluj County was too inaccessible a place for Apahida, and decided to add in Category:Geography of Romania, and then someone did the same for Iclod, and pretty soon, that category ended up with ~3000 entries? Well, for one, it would become pretty useless, don't you think? Which is why we have Category:Populated places in Cluj County, Category:Cluj County, Category:Geography of Transylvania (but not, incidentally, Category:Geography of Moldavia and Category:Geography of Wallachia). Everything in its proper place.
Plus, there's an actual guideline meant to be followed: WP:CAT, which speaks of """"the general rule that pages are not placed in both a category and its subcategory"""". I understand your problems with the system, but it is what we have for now.

If you haven´t read the galling article, how do you know it´s something wrong whit it? I can assure you that everything I put the Wikipedia galling article it is extensively peer-viewed and approved at Karlstad University, Sweden.

  

What is this """"live-chat service"""" that you speak of? I haven't ever heard of one. The proper way to discuss the templates is here on the talk page of the article. All three are applicable because: 1.  the English needs to be improved 2.  you have pretty much taken ownership of the article 3.  the article needs more wikilinks. Hope that explains it.   

Hi dude, Wazz up , why didn´t you include my entire massege? 
It looks very miserable and whining, as it reads above =)

Are you kidding me?, so you don´t have a """"Wikipedia live-chat service"""", strange because I used it, and if that isn´t possible must sombody be realy evil. No suprise to me when the whole world is bullying and abusing people who have no means of fighting back, with the exeption of trying to make it so clear how horrific the discussion, realy can be. And it is to be hoped that somewhone in the crowd of onlookers finally realize the unreasonable and unjust in the many´s bullying against an unknowing victim or potential plaintiff.

Regarding your, , complaints quotation: """"you have pretty much taken ownership of the article 3."""" end quotation, I can only reply that there are several others who make contributions to the galling article and I only make sure it´s scientificly correct with regards to syntax and source. 
Some parts have I watched extra carefully, for example the pictures because I made them and it´s therefore easy for me to correct the content and syntax of the description. 
Other peaople are free to write any knew exiting findings and I will not change anything as long it´s has warranty.
A lot of the text have been changed by others over the years and is still present in the article so don´t blame me for something that clearly isn´t true. 
  

I thought I did include the whole message, other than the greeting. If I missed something else, then feel free to copy it over; it was a mistake if I missed it. After looking through the history of the article it doesn't appear that you've taken ownership of the article. So I'm cool with dropping the COI tag.   """,0.0

 islam the religion of peace???? 

My mind is not able to accept the fact that islam is a religion of tolerance,humanity,love etc. why? Let me elucidate it -

islam is the only religion which is spread through force or by giving some benefits to man as they will force woman & children to convert to islam.The benfits include four time marriage,divorce can be done by saying """"divorce-divorce-divorce"""" & you can """"buy"""" another girl & force her to marry with you by giving some money to her father.muhammad himself married to a 9 year girl when he is 60 year old fat ball (Yes muhammad is a pedophile).

Some of the ugliest punishments is reserved for islam like beating to death a woman or man by stoning(as this is happening is various muslim nations),beheading,lashes etc.

Womans are treated like animals & there job is restricted only to give birth to as many childs as they can(untill she dies giving birth to yet another child).They are forced to wear """"burqas"""" in public & to have a white plaster on face in home.

These all things attract only those people from a society who thinks that this is the """"opportunity"""" to satisfy there desires.They are ofthen those individuals who have lowest ethics in life.

And why muslims are spread all over the world? ,The reason is that as all societies in the world have some real opportunitists,cowards in some number then only those choose this religion,this is unlike HINDUS & SIKHS who are mainly concentrated in south asia initially(Now they are going to other parts of the world).

Now some of the muslims are even not fully confident about islam, they know that in todays world practicing this religion in it's full version is not possible so they have created there own version and labeled it as """"tolerent islam"""" that means that even they also knows that islam is not tolerent in it's full version.

How is it possible that you pick one thing from islam as per your convenience like only jehad is picked up by muslims all around the world.

Today even muslim don't trust another muslim(not to talk about another religions) most notabley is the numerous fighting between muslim countries & muslim groups like iran-iraq,balochistan-pakistan etc.This is why they are not able to achieve muslim ummah or unity of muslims.

Only muslims are fighting in all around the world(as they are intolerent towards another religions) name it chechanya,palestine etc.As long as they are in minority they live quietly only waiting for an opportunity to come.And also multiplying there numbers(thanks to 4 marrigies & 10 childs per marrige).Then they start the fight for a separate homeland.

"Absolute Proof that 0.999... IS NOT EQUAL TO 1 
A math-wiki:

You are wrong about infinite representation. The ancient Greeks *never* represented 1/3 as 0.333... 

Now let me refute your argument regarding the transitive property:

A)    1=3(1/3)
B)    3(1/3) = 3(0.333...)
C)    3(0.333...) =0.999... 

The problem here occurs in B) where you assume that 3 * 0.333... = 3 * 1/3. You have 'not proved' anything. On the contrary, you have only proved that you are assuming 1/3 = 0.333... which it is obviously 'not equal'. 0.333... is an 'indeterminate' number because it cannot be represented finitely in base 10. 
0.333... is not equal to 1/3 so you cannot say that 1/3 is a finite representation. An indeterminate number is a number that is repeating in any
radix system.

You mention the division algorithm but do you know what it says? The division algorithm has 'nothing' to do with radix systems. Let me state it for you - If a and b are two given integers, there are unique integers q and r
such that a=bq + r and  0<= r < b. Now I will use the division algorithm to prove that you are WRONG once and for all. Suppose a = 1 and b = 0.999..., then 
what are the integers q and r such that the above is true?

Suppose that q = 0 and r = 1. Then the division algorithm fails because it makes a false statement i.e. q and r can both be 0 and 1 respectively.
For example: 1 = (0.999...)(1)+0 and 1 = (0.999...)(0)+1. So by default, the
division algorithm is proved false if 0.999... is equal to 1. And you can say a lot of things about the Greeks, but they would not make a stupid mistake like this. They were the smartest race in ancient times.

Now suppose that you try to tell me that either form is acceptable in the case of 0 and 1, you will still end up with a terrible contradiction:

1=(0.999...)(0)+1. The second form in this case implies that 1 < 0.999... since r < b. But how can 1 be less than 0.999... ??!!

 Is Brian really an atheist? 

In the recently aired episode, """"April in Quahog"""", Brian can be clearly observed praying some time after the news report leads the public to believe that a black hole is going to swallow the earth. Also, at the end of the episode, Brian leaves the house saying he made a deal with someone that now that the earth is spared he would go volunteer at the soup kitchen. Based on the context of the situation and Stewie's remark in the background that the 'someone' Brian made a deal with was God, this calls Brian's atheism into question and suggests that he has developed some closeted religious beliefs (though other evidence from previous episodes might lead one to suspect that they have been there all along). There are only two other explanations for this series of events that I can think of: One would be that one of the underlying ideas behind the episode is something to the tune of 'there are no atheists in foxholes', though this is unlikely because Brian can be seen following through with his promise which a person who had temporarily reverted to religion because of fear wouldn't do, let alone that any kind of conservative message is very unlike McFarlane. The other would be that McFarlane is somehow poking fun at peoples' work righteous attitude towards religion, however this is also unlikely because in order to understand the joke, an in depth understanding of what Christianity actually teaches would be required which most people (including McFarlane) likely do not posses.

 Having a Rank, Edits on another page 

I was wondering if you could make me one of the Generals if I do good. It is a rank weaker than the Co-Founder, Co-Ordinator, 2nd In Command and many others that arrive before me. Please let me know.
Also, I have a problem with this Marcus2 in the Powerpuff Girls Talk Page. Not only me but also Rattis1 and probably some other users don't like him because he always delete quite important resources and ones that is known as comments like the Powerpuff Girls won the Friday Premieres or something like that. Please let me know.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs) 09:00, August 27, 2007 (UTC) 
The """"ranks"""" aren't really indicative of any power and only really serve to indicate who organises the project at the top level, otherwise it's fairly meaningless. You can join but you won't be appointed any title as it's a level playing field here. 

As for the ongoing issue with Talk:The Powerpuff Girls, I've been watching and noticing the edit war you have with  to me and the information about the ratings and demographics could be shortened as the article comes across as fairly one-sided and fanboyish with such info. You need arbitration but moreso need to get a consensus on notability and push the quality up so it can be opined correctly at Peer Review which many CN articles will be undergoing from B-Class down. 

Thanks for your enquiry though, hopefully this helped and if you require more help you can ask User Talk:Yngvarr who has a good record for helpfulness.   talk 

I'll take your words. Since you said that Marcus2 was right about the Cultural References thing, then I'll just let it go if he comes back. Thanks for your assitance Treelo. I'll try my best to make Wikipedia a peaceful place. I learned that I don't really need a rank after all. I should just, like I said, keep Wikipedia peaceful, that's all. Thanks again Treelo, I appreciate your opinion and comments. I'll try my best to completely follow the rules from now on. Alert me if you want to if you noticed me bearking one of the rules again then I'll change that habit As Soon As Possible. Thanks again.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)

Since you're another one of the people who have worked for Iggy Arbuckle's article, I've asked you for help on this matter, along with the others.

Ernie Smith writes Æµ§œš1

Æµ§œš1, you state or pose as an interrogative; “So what you are saying is that OUSD was addressing """"Ebonics"""" as being defined as i or ii, and specifically and overtly excluding iii.”  In reply sentence, I say, I am saying what I have said and I reiterate it here; """"the proponents of the term Ebonics view and use the word Ebonics only one way.  That way being; from an Africa centered comparative linguistic perspective”.   I have said and I reiterate it here; “... As defined by Robert Williams the word Ebonics posits an Afrocentric view relative the origin and historical development of the language of descendants of enslaved Africans in America and throughout the diaspora. The view that the language of descendants enslaved Africans in America and throughout the diaspora is a dialect of English or some other European language is a non Afrocentric view and it has nothing to do with Ebonics”.   In other words Æµ§œš1, there are ‘proponents of Ebonics’ and are ‘anti-proponents of Ebonics’.  The proponents of Ebonics are those who view and use the word Ebonics from an Africa centered comparative linguistic perspective.   The 'anti-propronents of Ebonics' are those who do not use view and use the word Ebonics from an Africa centered comparative linguistic perspective.  The parents of the children of African ancestry in the OUSD for which the OUSD Board passed the resolution in 1996 were parents who are ‘proponents of Ebonics’.  That is, they are parents who view and use the word Ebonics from an Africa centered comparative linguistic perspective.   I have said and and I reiterate here;  “the OUSD Board's December 18, 1996, resolution was not about children who speak African American Vernacular English, Black English or any other appellation that implies inherently that the English language is the home, native or primary language of the parents and children that were the specific basis for the Oakland Unified School Districts (OUSD) resolution.  The OUSD December 18, 1996 resolution was concerning children whose parents had identified their home, native or primary language as (1) """"Ebonics"""", (2) """"Pan African Communication Behaviors"""" and/or (3) """"African Language Systems"""".  I say, Wikipedia article that posits the OUSD resolution was about African American Vernacular English is a outright lie.  

You state or pose as an interrogative Æµ§œš1; “So what you are saying is that OUSD was addressing """"Ebonics"""" as being defined as i or ii, and specifically and overtly excluding iii.”  In reply, I say what I have said and I reiterate it here;  the view that Baugh posits as Afrocentric view number (iii) is not Afrocentric at all.  I have said and I reiterate here, the view that Ebonics “is the equivalent of black English and is considered to be a dialect of English"""" (and thus merely an alternative term for African American Vernacular English|AAVE” is Eurocentric”.  I have said and I reiterate here, the other three views that Baugh posits as being the view of Afrocentric proponents of Ebonics, i.e., views  (i), (ii) and (iv), are Afrocentric.  Given that I did in fact include view number (iv) as an Afrocentric view I am at a loss to understand why you have excluded view number (iv) from what I have said concerning the OUSD resolution.   You should know that I'm suspicious of your having ommited view number (iv).  For view number (iv), i.e., the view that Ebonics “is the antonym of black English and is considered to be a language other than English"""" (and thus a rejection of the notion of """"African American Vernacular English"""" but nevertheless a term for what others term AAVE, viewed as an independent language and not a mere ethnolect)"""" is what was expressly being supported in the OUSD resolution.    

Now, with regards to your interroagative concerning whether the first paragraph of the OUSD Policy Statement  “could be interpreted as meaning that parents don't have to endorse the controversial classification to accept the services offered”.  My reply is; the OUSD Policy Statement was explictly informing the hog maws and hot souce eating Negro parents in the OUSD who are uncomfortable with their Afrcian ancestry and do not or did not indentify their child’s or childern’s home, primary or native language as Ebonics or as an African language system that the resolution does not pertain to them.  The OUSD Policy Statement was explictly informing the hog maws and hot souce eating Negro parents in the OUSD are uncofortable with their Afrcian ancestry and do or did not indentify their childrens’ home, primary or native language as Ebonics or as an African language system that, if they believe their home, primary or native language is English, Non standard English, Black English or African American Vecaular English (i.e., the language slaves or dogs born in the master’s house) they can continue receiving the Special Education, Speech Pathology a",0.0

Wikipedia:WikiProject_Drugs
I need to start a project that automates factual changes/insertions (like rambot).  A lot of incorrect information exists in or basic factual information is missing from drug related articles.  This is stuff that can be easily looked up online and are basic scientific facts for which there is no argument over.  The information can be found from several online drug databases including rxlist.com, medlineplus.gov, the official websites of drug manufacturers (they have free, detailed information sheets) and other various websites.

I plan on writing a bot which can automatically 'rip' factual information (which is non-copyrightable due to its factual nature) and create an off-site database.  I will offer this database for free for people to download, so both they and I can work on bots that can integrate the information in articles.

This would require considerable collaboration with the drugs wikiproject people to provide a standard format for all drugs articles beyond the simplistic efforts taken so far so that I can ensure the bot will behave properly and insert information only in a correct manner.

For clarity, this is information regarding side effects, [bio]chemistry, routes of administration, drug names (brand name and genericmy bot will autmoatically look up International Nonproprietary Name, USAN, BAN and other names) as well as other clearly factual things.

A question needs to be raised regarding drug pages, how should they be organized?  The full information sheets on drugs are very large and rather complicated from a lay person's perspective, perhaps it would make sense to integrate full infomration (including the results of studies on it) on a separate """"full information"""" page while keeping the main page a summary?
Wikipedia:WikiProject U.S. Supreme Court cases
Some of the SCOTUS articles (Lawrence v. Texas, Bowers v. Hardwick) have caught my interest and I may decide to do some bot automation with them also, but I'm not sure what yet.  There are various large legal database websites available which I can legally rip information from in the same manner as with the drug project above.

If using hubs there is a limit imposed by the need for a collision to be detected everywhere, iirc it's officially two hubs for fast ethernet (though in practice you may get away with more due to shorter than required delays in the hubs) but hardly anyone uses hubs anymore so this is largely irrelevent in modern network design. Switches either seperate collision domains or eliminate them entirely so this isn't a problem on a switch based network. Eventually the delays would build up to the point where higher level protocols started to time out but the network would have to get huge for that to happen with most protocols.
Practically there are several other troublesome factors. One is that switches rely on storing the mac addresses of every machine on the lan to decide where to send packets. If there are too many machines for the switches to store the switches will """"fail open"""" and end up broadcasting traffic they don't know where to send to the whole network. Furthermore being a tree network a lot of traffic will tend to cluster on the center of the tree (the impact of this can be reduced by making those parts of the network higher speed or by using techniques like port trunking).""",0.0

He also cited two prior blocks.  First of all, note that two or three alleged violations over the course of years of productive editing is nothing.  And second, those other two blocks were both ridiuclous too.  In one I was blocked for violating the 3RR, even though I only reverted 3 times in a day.

 UNBLOCK ME YOU ASSHOES! 

{{unblock|HAHAHAHA!!!

One of my favorite and most vivid memories was of a party I attended in high school. It was near the end of the year, and everyone was letting loose. The party had not gotten too badly out of control, and was finally winding down.

I was dating Karen at the time. We'd been going out for about six months. We knew our time together was growing short since we'd soon be heading off to college, she to Radcliffe, and I to Johns Hopkins. We were taking every chance we could to be intimate. I'd been with a few girls before, but Karen had been my first long term intimate relationship, and we'd taught each other lots.

The party was at Keith's house and we were helping him clean up. There were only six of us left, Karen and I, Keith, his girlfriend Linda, Tom and his girlfriend Sue. Linda lived just a few doors down and had invited Karen and Sue to spend the night. Tom was going to spend the night at Keith's house. Conveniently, Linda's parents were out of town until tomorrow noon, so nobody really had anywhere they had to go, and once we'd done a fair job of cleaning up we are able to sit back and relax.

Keith was my best friend. We had a lot in common, even if we were a bit of a """"Mutt and Jeff"""" in appearance. Both of us tall, I had a wide body, result of my Hawaiian ancestry, while he was lean and blonde. I'm 6'1"""" but he had a good 2 inches on me, and had long hair past his shoulders. Mine is brown and curly, and usually just goes whereever it wants. I'm strong as an ox, he's lean and fast. But we had similar taste in women. On more than one occasion I teased him that there was no way he deserved to be with Linda, our high-school goddess, and he was extremely envious that I had Karen, our big-breasted sexy bombshell, as my partner.

Karen and Sue were close friends. If we'd had Diana here, the triumvirate would have been complete. They had all been innocents until that year. Diana was dating, and Karen told me that she and Ryan were 'almost there', doing everything except the final act. Karen hadn't done much of anything until we'd gotten together. But we didn't let grass grow under us, and we made up for a lot of lost time. We'd had sex plenty, and she'd sucked me off more times than I can count. I'd even fucked her incredible tits a couple of times. Sue, it turns out, was the late bloomer. She was still an innocent according to Karen. Kissing was as far as she'd gone, although it seems she'd rubbed Tom's dick through his pants, and he'd had his hands on her mound, even if the underwear was still in the way. But Karen was hinting that this party might be Tom's lucky night.

We were joking about some of the antics that had been going on at the party. Linda in particular was a lurker; she'd sit back and watch all the activities at the party and was always good for a few laughs.

""""There were some really desperate people here tonight,"""" she said. """"Can you believe Gary tried to get a game of Spin the Bottle going?""""

""""I can't say I really blame him,"""" I answered with a grin. """"Not every guy there is as fortunate as us to have such gorgeous girlfriends, or any girlfriend for that matter. Hell, I wouldn'd mind playing it now!"""" That earned me a poke in the ribs from Karen.

Sue chimed in, """"Why is it that every party ends up with some lame guy trying to start some stupid game like Spin the Bottle, Post Office, or Strip Poker?""""

""""Now that's a stupid question,"""" Keith answered.

""""And why is that?"""" Linda asked, pointedly.

""""Isn't it obvious?"""" Keith replied.

""""No."""" Linda and Sue answered in unison.

""""Do you want to tell them?"""" Keith asked me with a nod.

So I explained the obvious. """"Because they ARE desperate - and sometimes it works.""""

""""Oh please!"""" Karen said.

Keith was a real instigator. """"You guys have never played Spin the Bottle?""""

The girls looked at each other. """"Maybe a few times, but certainly not in the last year."""" Linda finally answered.

""""And how about Truth or Dare?"""" Keith continued egging them on.

""""Well sure, but usually only with people we know really well,"""" Karen answered this time.

""""Usually."""" Keith echoed with a grin. """"And it's not like you've never played Strip Poker.""""

The girls looked at each other quietly no one answering.

""""Oh come on,"""" I teased, """"Karen I know you've played Strip Poker.""""

""""Not really. I watched part of a game, but then they chased everyone not playing out of the room. Why? I suppose you've played it?"""" She asked with a dangerous tone in her voice.

""""Sort of. In camp we started a game but it got raided before we got anywhere."""" I confessed, drawing a laugh from the guys. """"L",0.42857142857142855

 Hoover's murder investigation re Kennedy 

The information about Hoover's role in the murder investigation of President Kennedy is well documented.

Hoover personally directed the investigation into the murder of President John F. Kennedy which is often called the """"Crime of the Century."""" The first citation in the Kennedy murder section of the article refers to a report by a congressional committee called the House Select Committee on Assassinations. It issued its report in 1979 after a three year investigation into the assassination of John Kennedy, Martin Luther King, and Robert Kennedy.   The report by the Congressional Committee was critical of the performance by the FBI as well as other agencies. 

The second citation in the section on the Kennedy murder is to the PBS Frontline news show. It was reviewing the official government records that “electrified” top Washington insiders and have been kept secret for over 40 years. These secret documents were obtained by the Assassination Records Review Board many years after they were sealed away from public disclosure. The once secret documents are fascinating, especially as reviewed by PBS.  

Hoover conferred with Nicholas Katzenbach of the Justice Department about how to approach an investigation of Kennedy’s murder. The former Attorney General was grilled by the HSCA 15 years later on why he was intent on convincing the public that neither a left wing conspiracy or a right wing conspiracy was involved in Kennedy's assassination. The copy of his memo is carried by Lancer.  If the reader wants the full version of the testimony by Katzenbach the reader should go to the House Committee Report. 
President Johnson, along with Hoover, also knew about the Oswald impersonator right away  that certainly tends to show a right wing conspiracy with an impersonator pretending to be Oswald trying to contact a """"hit man.""""   Maybe there would be another motive for impersonating Oswald trying to contact a hit man other than to frame him. I don't know what it would be. 

There is no question the FBI, under Hoover, acted as the primary investigative arm of the Warren Commission, and Hoover testified to the Commission as seen from these once secret transcripts of the Warren Commission hearing:
 I have been unable to find any scintilla of evidence showing any foreign conspiracy or any domestic conspiracy that culminated in the assassination of President Kennedy   The testimony is unsealed now.

There is no secret anymore about the FBI destruction of evidence. They were caught and its now public knowledge. There is a full pulic record. The agent involved even wrote a book about it.    

The American public does not believe the conclusions reached by the Warren Commission and believes the government has something to hide.  This is what the Assassination Records Review Board believes. 

 Conclusion

Therefore, any editors that think there are other reputable sources that have information please put it in. One should not simply delete well known and documented information just because one doesn't like it. If that were the criteria for deleting information, then Wikipedia would be at the mercy of every public relations firm in the country. Nothing """"negative"""" can be written about a public figure because his or her publicist may find it unpleasant and delete it claiming the information is a """"theory."""" No, the information is documented by reputable sources.

What I can't figure out is why Mr. Hoover's sexual life gets so much space, and yet someone doesn't want information on Hoover's job performance on the biggest case of Hoover's career.

I have repeatedly expressed the opinion that the most idiotic, as opposed to merely lazy, thing that Tyson has been revealed to have done was to listen to Bush's Biblical quotation and write a note to himself (which in the event he was too lazy to locate) to the effect, apparently, that Bush had clowned himself by taking credit for star names that were actually Arabic. So, since I wrote the words you complain about, it should be obvious that they are not intended to make Tyson seem in any way correct. I would be in favor of making this clearer by quoting someone to the effect that attributing to Isaiah the intent to take credit for star charts drawn up a millennia after Isaiah's death is profoundly stupid, but I was in a hurry to replace a vacancy on the page and an appropriate source didn't spring to mind. In any case, I am adamantly opposed to the change you propose, since it removes all specifics, leaving a tasteless gruel, and I don't see anything particularly """"encyclopedic"""" about bad writing. The bit about Yahweh is directly from Tyson's acknowledgement of error on Facebook, btw, where he still shows no inkling of how moronic his interpretation of Bush's Biblical quotation is.   """,0.0

The person has received a well-known and significant award or honor, or has been nominated for one several times. The person has made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in his or her specific field. Generally, a person who is """"part of the enduring historical record"""" will have been written about, in depth, independently in multiple history books on that field, by historians.

The reference to Shirley Temple's Pussy is true. Not sure about Stinky Toilet Paper, but is was most likely just a name tossed around when they changed their name.

As someone who has been silently observing your behaviour over the past few months on Wikipedia, I am worried by what I perceive to be a downward spiral of petty fighting, vindictiveness, childishness and bad faith on your part.

Get a life! Find yourself a girl to have sex with or something, because the way you've been sliding downhill is bringing everyone else at this fine institution down.

 Who were the original members and what did they play? 

I am unable to be sure who the original members of the band were, how many they were, and what instruments they playe. Even sifting through the opening section leaves me with some uncertainty, although para 2 tells me the original drummer. I know this is a voluntary project, and I'm grateful for there being any info at at all. Nonetheless, after reading the first paragraph I'm unable to answer basic questions like this.

The opening says: """"The Jesus and Mary Chain originally revolved around the songwriting partnership of its two main members, plus third founding member, bass player Douglas Hart. In the early days, Reid's guitar would be left out of tune, while Hart's bass guitar only had two strings""""

Who were those two main members? What did they play? One Reid (which one?) plays guitar ... does the other play guitar too? Two main members plus third found member - this implies to me that it was a 3 piece band. Was it? Was the original drummer mentioned in para 2 the other """"main member""""?

 Mgnbar. What is a stupid act?? 

Hi  consensus means that every body must agree.
I don’t think Wikipedia have redefined the word """"consensus"""", even if they try to redefine the word “consensus” it doesn’t matter because the question is whether you people are doing something terribly wrong and stupid? Or if my work, pictures, theories, references, text and contributions to Wikipedia are wrong.

Clearly vast amounts of my contributions are still present in Wikipedia articles such as pictures, text and theories. Everything I have put in are still there except the one reference to all the pictures, theories and text!! 
The question is if it’s ok to use your own scientific work in Wikipeida.The answer is Yes!For example, It will be impossible to incorporate pictures in Wikipedia if you can’t give away your own pictures and include your own work as a reference to the same pictures.But do anybody really think any researcher can write an scientific article which isn’t based on his or her own knowledge including research?

And, according to Wikipedia rules, if someone want to improve the articles and for some reason doesn’t want my report as a reference, they must prove it wrong by discussions on the talk page.If the reference is found to be wrong. Then all the information, pictures and theories which I have contributed to in the Wikipedia articles galling, wear and Stress(mechanics) must be deleted. Because my contributions are closely linkt to my research.God luck with deleting all my contributions =) I think you have several hours of work in front of you and still you will do a terrible stupid mistake.

Please change """"irish-born British"""" to """"irish"""" or to """"irish who worked mainly in London"""" because of the following; The  says he was born AND grew up in Ireland apart from a stint in London during WW1. He then went travelling in 1926/1928 to London, Berlin, Paris and back to London. Also, when Francis was born in Ireland under British rule he would be British by his passport and then he would be automatically Irish by 1922  and could later reclaim his British nationality  which there is no evidence that he did. So he's irish until proven otherwise. Further to that it threatens the credibility of Wikipedia if a survey of people decide he is British because they think so.

"Confucianism 

Confucius predates Aristotle in using family as a model for the state.  He believed the child should be subordinate to the parent, younger brother to the older, wife to husband, and subject to the sovereign who is to be regarded as the father of the nation.  The state as the family writ large was the most harmonious, orderly, and natural form of government.  This was later expanded to cover international relations(i.e. the emperor of China as the older brother of the king of Korea).  Confucian family theory is still espoused in North Korea to justify their method of leadership succession.

 Midway = turning point 

In my view, if there WAS a turning point in the war on Japan, Midway has to be it. While the Japanese had been stopped at Coral Sea, they still had the initiative; they could still choose where and when to attack, and the allies had to react. But not after Midway! It was, after all, THEY that launched the Midway/Aleutians operation, and THEY that were then rocked back on their heels, and THEY that fled afterward. It was THEY that had lost 2/3 of their big, fast carriers (and the carrier was to the War in the Pacific what the ballistic missile was to the Cold War. Somewhere above someone argues that the remainder of the Japanese fleet was still a formidable force, but that is nonsense; all that force could do would be to sail out and get sunk by a carrier-equipped US NAvy)). Far from being """"merely"""" a tactical victory, it changed the whole complexion of the war. 

Now, while they DID attempt some more offensive action (notably by trying to take Port Moresby, again, this time over land via the Kokoda Trail in the 2nd half of 1942), this was all relatively minor, designed to strengthen their DEFENSIVE positions not to conquer, and was  ultimately almost all unsuccessful. They never again tried the kind of massive, seaborne, combined arms operation that had swept them across most of the Pacific in a just a few months. Then just 2 months after Midway the US landed on Guadalcanal, and clearly the initiative was ours, and Japan was in defensive mode. Thus the Guadalcanal campaign can't be considered the actual turning point either - by then the US was clearly on the attack.

I don't think the argument that there is no turning point because Japan could never have ultimately 'won' the Pacific war works out either. Japanese planners DID know that they could not win a long war MILITARILY but that was not their plan. Strategically their plans went something like: 

1. Start the war from as superior a position as possible (hence Pearl Harbor)
2. Race across the Pacific, seizing resources and territory BEFORE the US could gear up for war.
3. Attain as defensible a position as possible (Hence the Kokoda Trail offensive and takeover of the Solomons) and DIG IN.
4. Let the US grind itself down against near impregnable fortresses. 
5.Win a favorable peace settlement when the US tires itself out throwing itself against their defenses.

But they failed at (1) when they didn't sink the US carriers at Pearl Harbor, and only 6 months later Midway signalled the early end of (2). By the failure to take Port Moresby, they also failed at part of (3). They had some hope to succeed at (5); when the bloody costs of both Tarawa and Buna-Gona became known, US public opinion was shaken. Even as late as 1945, many americans found the though of the casualties invading Japan would cost to be appalling.

So, MY conclusion is that Midway WAS *the* turning point in the Pacific. I realize this whole idea of a turning point is rather subjective, but I really think if there was one in the South Pacific, it has to be Midway.

Reply
Are you being facetious? if not, you would have relayed the same message to Jza and MRSC as my words were no more stern than theres. If you would like evidence for any of the claims made on the talk, then I will only be too glad to provide. You also failed to provide diffs in your message to me, in regards to which words you're claiming are offesive, perhaps WP:Assume good faith.

The two users constantly harass and follow me to articles making disruptive edits in violation of numerous Wikipedia guidelines (WP:HARASS is just one). For example the removal of third party references from articles which don't suit their POV, without entering an edit summary (considered by Wikipedia guidelines as bad faith and a violation of WP:BLANK). The violation of WP:NEO by adding derogatory neologisms to the articles of organisations who they do not personally agree with, despite being made aware of the policy, despite not having any reference to the said organisation being described with said neologislm and despite the community majority constantly removing the derogatory term.  The same """"tag team"""" practise can be shown to be used against numerous other editors who edit articles on British culture and trad counties, not just against me. Again, if you would like evidence just ask.

It would seem however, looking at the messages on your talkpage above, especially the lovely intertude under """"UK mediation"""" section, that Jza messaged you (somebody he seems very familiar with) in violation of WP:CANVAS. Specifically the section on Wikipedia:CANVAS#Campaigning may interest you. If you're going to be an admin, may I suggest you please make yourself familiar with the policies and guidelines I have referenced in this message. Rather than accusing me, a user who is being cyberstalked, of """"personal attacks"""". Systematic bias is not acceptable, you're here to make sure that our policies are upheld not to chip in for the sake of a friend. Thanks. -   """,0.0
"""*E-dog, on another page, you wrote: 

Thanks for your message on my talk page. When I voted keep for Tom G. Palmer, I justified it by writing that """"Google returns 13500 hits for the query """"Tom G. Palmer"""" cato [3]."""" """"Tom G. Palmer"""" alone returns 34,900 hits on Google [4]. So on this point, my vote is not necessarily inconsistent (34,900 > 19,000).
Well, sure, but that's weak""""35000 is notable, but 19000 isn't"""". Come on. That's not serious.

But even if you had 50,000 hits on Google, I might also have refrained from voting. This is mainly because I am concerned about you putting so much pressure to have your own article. If I was in your position, I would probably keep my distance from the discussion. You are a primary source of information for yourself and, in that sense, your position might be biased. I am not sure whether your attitude fits with the Neutral point of view policy (which applies to articles, but probably also to the way the encyclopedia should be created as a whole). I don't know, and I prefer to abstain from the vote.
Understandable, and advice well taken and appreciated. But I am a justice seeker. I really don't care as much if my entry is deleted or not, as for whether I fight to vindicate my unfair treatment (as I perceive it). Here I was, many moon ago, minding my own damn business, and someone tells me I have a Wiki entry. Interesting. Then someone says it's up for delete. What do I care. I really don't give a damn. But some jerk says it's non-notable (okay by meI didn't konw Wiki policies on this at the time anyway); and vanity. Implying I did it, as self-promotion. This pissed me off. I rebutted the latter charge and did not even mention the notable charge. Later, many months later, someone tells me he has initiated VfD for Palmer's site. Now this was right after the Wiki entries of some CLEARLY notable friends of mine were vandalizedHans-Hermann Hoppe, Lew Rockwell with ridiculous charges of racism etc., of the same type made by Palmer. So I figure, let's take a look at his entry. I did so, and in the ensuing VfD debate, realize there are actual policies on this; I studied them and thought, """"son of a bitch. I qualify. By their own policies. These wikinerds should not have deleted me. And to top it off, the same one who voted to delete me is voting to keep Palmer. Something ain't right."""" So, instead of dishonestly putting up my entry anonymously or through a meatpuppet, I did it myself, nothing hidden. And instead of rolling over and playing dead as I did last time, I decided this time, I will make noise and make sure that if I have anything ot say about it, the voters will be made aware of the policies. That is all. If a fair evaluation of my site and aplication of the policies leads to a good faith vote to delete my entry, I don't care. But what do I see? Peopel who vote to keep Palmer up on the grounds that he is openly gay, or has a large number of publications, or has 13000 google hits, voting to delete me, even though I have similar criteria. It makes it seem arbitrary to me. So can you blame me for monitoring this a little bit, and being a bit frustrated at the seemingly arbitrary actions of some people? Nom.

 My WP Experience 

Thank you for welcoming me, Materialscientist. After some time here I can tell you that I really admire WP as a joint effort by many to create something constructive. The several weeks I have been here has been an interesting experience. I learned a lot, wandering around the Random articles. I also tried to contribute on issues that I know well. I had my share of learning other people's academic formation and their inner world (psychologies)i.e. how they react to the unknown or suppressed. As a social scientist, I was surprised to see the magnified importance of the behaviour and perception factors. I think I should learn more on social psychology and related behavioural disciplines to apply in my work. To cut a long story short, I think I have been doing my humble contribution to the WP but believe could have done more in this rather short period, should I not faced reactionary attitudes, especially on """"national"""" issues. It is really astonishing to see how people react to editing events that have occurred before our grandfathers were born, if they suspect their world of conceived reality is threatened. Never mind if these words look confusing to you, because they also are for me. I know I simply received a -perhaps automated- welcome message from you and am not expecting an answer to these lines. Indeed I am writing more as a factor of self inspection and will certainly erase these lines after a short while. All the best.  """,0.0

 Language and Writing section cleanup

 IRB members of the provisional committee 

Since no one seems to have a reliable source on when Plunkett, MacDonagh, and O'Lochlainn joined the IRB, and if it was before the Provisional Committee ceased functioning (evidently in Oct, 1914) saying the IRB held half the committee appears to be unfounded. If someone can quote a passage making this absolutely clear, they should do so.

 Richard III  

Now is the winter of our discontent 
Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house 
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths; 
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments; 
Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings, 
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures. 
Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
And now, instead of mounting barded steeds 
To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,
Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty 
To strut before a wanton ambling nymph; 
I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion, 
Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time
Into this breathing world, scarce half made up, 
And that so lamely and unfashionable
That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;
Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,
Have no delight to pass away the time,
Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
And descant on mine own deformity:
And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,

This royal throne of kings, this scepter'd isle,
This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars, 
This other Eden, demi-paradise, 
This fortress built by Nature for herself
Against infection and the hand of war, 
This happy breed of men, this little world, 
This precious stone set in the silver sea, 
Which serves it in the office of a wall, 
Or as a moat defensive to a house,
Against the envy of less happier lands, 
This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England, 
This nurse, this teeming womb of royal kings, 
Fear'd by their breed and famous by their birth, 
Renowned for their deeds as far from home,
For Christian service and true chivalry, 
As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry, 
Of the world's ransom, blessed Mary's Son, 
This land of such dear souls, this dear dear land, 
Dear for her reputation through the world,
Is now leased out, I die pronouncing it, 
Like to a tenement or pelting farm:",0.0

"""::::::: Hi  consensus means that every body must agree.
 I don’t think Wikipedia have redefined the word """"consensus"""", even if they try to redefine the word “consensus” it doesn’t matter because the question is whether you people are doing something terribly wrong and stupid?Or if my work, pictures, theories, references, text and contributions to Wikipedia are wrong.

Clearly vast amounts of my contributions are still present in Wikipedia articles such as pictures, text and theories. Everything I have put in are still there except the one reference to all the pictures, theories and text!! 

The question is if it’s ok to use your own scientific work in Wikipeida.
The answer is Yes!
For example, It will be impossible to incorporate pictures in Wikipedia if you can’t give away your own pictures and include your own work as a reference to the same pictures.
But do anybody really think any researcher can write an scientific article which isn’t based on his or her own knowledge including research?

And, according to Wikipedia rules, if someone want to improve the articles and for some reason doesn’t want my report as a reference, they must prove it wrong by discussions on the talk page. 
If the reference is found to be wrong. Then all the information, pictures and theories which I have contributed to in the Wikipedia articles galling, wear and Stress(mechanics) must be deleted. Because my contributions are closely linkt to my research.
God luck with deleting all my contributions =) I think you have several hours of work in front of you and still you will do a terrible stupid mistake.

Penis envy
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump to: navigation, search
For the Crass album, see Penis Envy (album). For the Virgin 1 documentary, see ....Envy.

Penis envy in Freudian psychoanalysis refers to the theorized reaction of a girl during her psychosexual development to the realization that she does not have a penis. Freud considered this realization a defining moment in the development of gender and sexual identity for women. According to Freud, the parallel reaction in boys to the realization that girls do not have a penis is castration anxiety.

In contemporary culture, the term is sometimes used symbolically or metaphorically to refer to the idea that women wish they had a penis, or to refer to anxieties between men about the size of their genitals.

[edit] Freud's Theory

Sigmund Freud introduced the concept of a little girl's interest in—and envy of— the penis in his 1908 article """"On the Sexual Theories of Children,"""" but did not fully develop the idea until substantially later in 1914 when his work On Narcissism was published. It was not mentioned in the first edition of Freud's earlier Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex (1905).

The term came to significance as Freud gradually refined his views of female sexuality, coming to describe a mental process he believed occurred in girls as they passed through the Electra complex from the phallic stage to the latency stage (see Psychosexual development).

In Freud’s psychosexual development theory, the phallic stage (approximately between the ages of 3.5 and 6) is the first period of development in which the libidinal focus is primarily on the genital area. Prior to this stage, the libido (broadly defined by Freud as the primary motivating energy force within the mind) focuses on other physiological areas. For instance, in the oral stage, in the first 12 to 18 months of life, libidinal needs concentrate on the desire to eat, sleep, suck and bite. The theory suggests that the penis becomes the organ of principal interest to both sexes in the phallic stage. This becomes the catalyst for a series of pivotal events in psychosexual development. These events—known as the Oedipus complex for boys and the Electra complex for girls—result in significantly different outcomes for each gender because of differences in anatomy.

For girls:

    * Soon after the libidinal shift to the penis, the child develops her first sexual impulses towards her mother.
    * The girl realizes that she is not physically equipped to have a heterosexual relationship with her mother, since she does not have a penis.
    * She desires a penis, and the power that it represents. This is described as penis envy. She sees the solution as obtaining her father’s penis.
    * She develops a sexual desire for her father.
    * The girl blames her mother for her apparent castration (what she sees as punishment by the mother for being attracted to the father) assisting a shift in the focus of her sexual impulses from her mother to her father.
    * Sexual desire for her father leads to the desire to replace and eliminate her mother.
    * The girl identifies with her mother so that she might learn to mimic her, and thus replace her.
    * The child anticipates that both aforementioned desires will incur punishment (by the principle of lex talionis)
    * The girl employs the defence mechanism of displacement to shift the object of her sexual desires from her father to men in general.

The offshoot of these events, often cited in the media and colloquially, is that a girl really wants to become her mother, so that she can control her father.

A similar process occurs in boys of the same age as they pass through the phallic stage of development. The key differences being that the focus of sexual impulses need not switch from mother to father, and that the fear of castration (castration anxiety) remains. The boy desires his mother, and identifies with his father, whom he sees as having the object of his sexual impulses. Furthermore, the boy’s father, being the powerful aggressor of the family unit, is sufficiently menacing that the boy employs the defense mechanism of displacement to shift the object of his sexual desires from his mother to women in general.

Freud thought this series of events occurred prior to the development of a wider sense of sexual identity, and was required for an individual to continue to enter into his or her gen",0.14285714285714285

Yes, I thank you for your time in the matter and I know you were trying to help. I can see that what I was doing was violating WP:POINT. 

Originally the argument was because of the table width which I knew from the beginning was a dumb thing to fight over, but I was only thinking of aesthetics. She trounced me for it saying that I don't know what I'm doing, that she was enforcing MoS standards and it was a known problem because the page didn't show up correctly on certain monitor sizes. All I wanted was for her to show me where these standards are written, and if not that, where this issue was being discussed if it's such a big problem. Of course she couldn't. Why? Because they don't exist. I called her bluff, she knew it, and then she acted all innocent like I came out of no where to bully her. I got aggressive only after her rude, holier-than-thou tirade started.

I've had to play this stupid game before with other idiots around here, usually they just go away, but she wanted to continue talking shit. She's just one of those crybabies who think they own the damn place and that kind of attitude pisses me off to no end. Sorry, but that's just me. I see bullshit everyday on here and I ignore 99% of it. She just happened to rub me the wrong way.

Since those comments many edits have been made to the article, and it would be foolish to assume those edits were made solely with intent to improve the article.

Prior to comments made, the article hadn't been edited in weeks and most of the edits prior to that were minor edits, mostly a bunch of grammar and some reworking of sentences and sentence structure. I think the lack of editing of the article and the nature of previous edits shows that for such a longstanding article, there was a silent consensus that the article was good and needing very little. 

Now look at it. The section on the ride alone dominates the article, much of it relates to whether or not Revere was warning who or what when prior to June 5th such sections and commentary were neither present nor viewed as necessary to article.

Notice, how again you present a hopelessly goofy claim, user Labongo.  Can you show us one such occasion where what we have been after has been offered to us, in terms of quotes and the related page informaiton ?

No one has asked as an attachment for the Kven text a list of references which disagree with the information offered.  This is the absurd case now.

We need to see where exactly those offered sources agree with the written text offered in the Kven article.  Those sort of pinpointed and exact - easily verifiable (as Mr. Mikkalai wants) - quotes and sources are offered in several key points of the Diki Wiki's text.  For us to ask you to understand the difference in that approach is too much to hope for, it appears.  

You appear to be too young for this sort of conversation, it seems safe to state.  

In the case of user Driakko's text that sort of showing of exact book and page information and - importantly user Labongo - exact quotes on those pages from known and credited historians and/or other scientist cannot be provided.

Read the bold text from the above sentence.  That is what is wanted, not what you claim that has been requested !  Please, read what our messages exactly say.  After you have done that, please stop setting words in the mouths of others, and particularly in the mouths of historians in relation to the Kven text. 

Perhaps just for you - and the types of you - it is important to repeat yet one more time:  We have never asked - and we are not asking now, and we shall not ask in the future - a list of related books an/or historians who have written about the topic.  Instead, we are asking for it to be pointed out where exactly those given sources agree with text pushed for Wikipedia.

We are familiar with the sources offered.  They appear to disagree with the text of user Drieakko !

"Sick POV
What the hell? 
User:Izady is a sick fuck:

It should be noted that the conditions in which individuals died varies from site to site. The people that were buried in these graves are believed to have been members of the Kurdish population which was in support of Iranian occupancy of Iraq at the time of their death (circa 1980's) 'and who deserved to die in the hands of patriotic Sunni Arabs of Iraq'. The legitimacy of claims of atrocity are debateable for this reason, 'since Sunni Arabs are too honorable to do any such things'. The distinction between those who have died in military style combat or executed under the direction of a lawful court of President Saddam Hussein, although buried disrespectfully, and those who have been victims of genocide, ethnic cleansing or otherwise murdered innocently and buried efficiently is a bright line; mass burial should not be assumed to be evidence of criminal activity. 'These Shia and Kurds were traitors to Iraq and were fairly tried and executed by the patriot Arab Sunnis for their crimes', although the burial was not always respectful. Victims of chemical weapons are unknown, 'and they too were traitor Kurds and deserved the punishment by the patriotic Saddam government'.",0.42857142857142855

Should this article contain any dialogue regarding the criticisms of the Open Source concept? One example that springs to mind is Blender; the interface dictated that it was commercially unsuccesful, however, after being expanded upon by open-source development, the resultant software is still plagued by poor interface design that frustrates users, making it difficult to use the powerful software behind the interface. 

Other problems worth noting could be the lack of documentation surrounding active development that makes it difficult to utilize a product to its full potential.

Perhaps this has already been mentioned, or there is a better forum for bringing it up; I myself am not well-versed or articulate enough to express a significant or valuable dialogue on the topic - I am merely aware that such criticisms exist and perhaps should be acknowledged.",0.0

He uses the term loosely since it’s not a real printed comic. He has no examples of his drawing, what kind of cartoonist doesn’t put their work online. PROVE THAT SHIT!

He stated in this post to Wikipedia that his book Battle Neverending’s 3 thousand copies sold out in one year which is a total lie. He printed them in 1998 and was still selling them as recent as 2006

http://www.popocculture.com/28/battle-neverending-by-saab-l

“Jarvis Marlow is the man who paid out of his own pocket for the second printing (one thousand copies) and third printing (two thousand copies) of Battle Neverending. I sold all three thousand copies of Btl Nvrg within the span of a year”. 

(Example #1 of his lies)

2000 copies of A.D. supposedly sold in one year or as Saab states (Record Time) which is also unverifiable whether it actually sold that fast since he out an out lied about Battle Neverendings.
The first A.D. was published by a small defunct anarchist publisher which describes itself as publishing """"pamphlets"""", sold out and was not reprinted.

“However, his claim to fame is the novel he wrote while still in the dorms at San Francisco State University, A.D., which was so radical a book it got him kicked out of college in 1997.”

When in reality

“Lofton wrote """"A.D."""" while a student at San Francisco State University and spent so much time hawking the book when it was published three years ago that his grades began to fall and the university cut off his financial aid”.

(Example #2 of his lies)

I ‘m not admitting any mistake about BERKELEY (you always want to appear very radical so I’m sure you told him you were homeless on the streets of Berkeley) because you made that up as well as being homeless! The only place you’ve been homeless was on your mothers couch for THREE YEARS ALL THE WHILE REFUSING TO WORK A DAY JOB, IM SURE TO YOUR MOTHERS AMAZEMENT ON JUST HOW MUCH OF A BUM HER SON TURNED OUT TO BE!

(Example #3 of his lies)

“In all the WEEKS you've been STALKING me, NOT ONE motherfucker has so much as e-mailed me and asked, """"is this anonymous, psuedonym-using piece of shit correct about anything?""""”.

I know nobody reads your shit anyway so I wouldn’t expect any response. I write these things simply because I know that you can’t handle risking your supposed fame! (Which is all you are interested in anyway). Your not an activist you’re an opportunist masking yourself in anarchy.

And finally I have this victory over your Racist Spoiled Black Privileged ass!

Here’s the dialog about shutting Saabs Wikepedia page because firstly it’s chalked full of made up shit and secondly they finally realize that he’s just another home publishing hack!

I've looked into the books listed in the bibliography... The first was published by a small defunct anarchist publisher which describes itself as publishing """"pamphlets"""", sold out and was not reprinted. The second was described by Pop Occulture Magazine as """"obviously a low-budget and quite-possibly home-printed affair"""". There is no evidence that either of these books received a credible review, much less meet WP:BOOK. Journalists are a dime-a-dozen and not automatically notable, and these books don't appear to establish notability either.

Therefore I am proposing deletion of the article. If the tag is remove, would someone please nominate for deletion? I can't as I can't create the deletion page... 67.67.219.223 (talk)

"""I actually hadn't even seen the current Equalization filter article when I spoke before, but now see that its content needs to be merged into the future article Equalization (audio) that you both have proposed. I could make the issue a little more complicated though: Graphic equalizer (not yet written), Smiley face curve, Parametric equalization, and British EQ all have to do with what I'll call """"Music equalization"""" (for lack of a better term). This includes sections 1 and 2 of the current Equalization filter  along with possible future articles tone controls, loudness control (combine with Smiley face), speaker equalization etc. Oh, I'm certainly not saying that these need to be separate articles, but could as well be topics in one article (except that a few of these already exist separately). The article should mention that """"equalization"""" is a misnomer (but has become the accepted term) since these are typically used to modify the tone to suit someone's taste, not strictly to compensate for a channel's frequency response.

Then there should be an article which discusses actual channel equalization (or some such term) which WOULD include section 3 of Equalization filter (Telecommunications lines), RIAA equalization, FM pre/de-emphasis as well as equalization of non-audio channels; this is the orginal meaning of """"equalization""""). Such equalizers are generally non-adjustable (by a user, at least) and transparent to the end user. So I call it a different subject, even when it IS audio. Anyway, I don't have much time to deal with this nor am I the best person to write about the specialized issues regarding either professional audio or channel equalization problems.

WP:SYNTH
An RfC was just closed at Talk:Climate change denial#RfC: Must the word 'denial; occur in every citation for climate change denial?, and it is interesting to read the closing statement there, in that it reflects community consensus about some aspects of when to use or not use sources about a topic without violating WP:SYNTH.   
The concluding statement says the term """"climate change denial"""" may be used if the source """"implicitly states they fall into the general group.""""  It has no relevance to anything discussed here.  It certainly is not a loophole for """"synthesis"""".    
I don't think anyone is looking for """"loopholes"""". I'm not arguing for any kind of slavish devotion to that discussion here, just for editors to take a look, and to think about it with an open mind. I think that the closing statement makes some good points about common sense.   
There is nothing """"slavish"""" about the devotion.  If most sources say the motivation of the terrorism is secular, then we cannot say it is religious and call it Christian terrorism.    
 I was saying that we don't have to follow that other page slavishly. And that other page isn't talking about situations where most sources say something is unrelated. If you are interested in what it does say, then you can read it. If you don't want to read it, then don't. Everything here does not have to be a WP:Battleground.   
As I have noted before, unless reliable sources attribute some religious motivation or aim,  I would not say Wikipedia should attribute such a motivation or aim.  If the sources ascribe motivation to irredentism, economic or other attribute and do not ascribe a religious aim, then it does not belong here.  Note the discussion just closed at Climate*.*  where the result was basically """"no consensus at all"""".  Cheers.   
Not sure what you mean, but I linked to a discussion where the closer said there was a consensus. I'm not going beyond what the closing statement said there.   
The issue has come up in articles about terrorism and about ideology.  Different writers may use different terms to mean the same thing or the same terms to mean different things.  Generally, in peer-reviewed literature, the terms used are defined and we can say that one author who defines """"Christian terrorism"""" as terrorism motivated by Christian belief and another who uses the term """"Christian religious terrorism"""" with the same definition are referring to the same thing.  However, another author who uses the expression """"Christian terrorism"""" and defines it as ethnic terrorism where religion is part of ethnic identity means the same thing as authors writing about """"religious communal terrorism"""" carried out by Christians, or """"nationalist terrorism"""" between different religious groups.
Can you provide a single source that should be included based on the opinion expresses in the climate change denial RfC?
  
I'm so tempted to just reply """"yes"""". And I really would rather not get into a wall-of-text over things that we will soon be discussing at the mediation. But let me try to clarify why I linked to that discussion. This isn't about definitions of """"Christian terrorism"""" in my view. It's about what the closing statement there said, that just because a particular word is not used explicitly in a source, does not mean that the source does not apply to a page – editors can use common sense to examine the context within the source. Thinking back to the discussions about the Lebanon section (now made somewhat moot by the Schbley source, that examines in detail the Maronite Monks), there was discussion of whether it was SYNTH to consider a United Nations source, because it used the word """"genocide"""" instead of the word """"terrorism"""". I'm pointing out that there is now some precedent for using common sense in evaluating the language of such sources, in context. If you or another editor sees common sense in that instance as indicating that genocide is not terrorism, that's still a discussion we can have. So that's why I provided that link. I'm not about to rewrite the Lebanon section on t",0.0

 General message 

Hi, Tournesol! This is just a general message you don't have to reply to, but it would be greatly appreciated if you do.

I know what I have done at SVWP, and I have done many things wrong there. And yes, I have been trolling a few times. The problem was I didn't even think about a permanent block. I simply thought that if you were contributing constructively (no vandalism), you are welcome. But, I should've read sv:Wikipedia:Det är ingen rättighet att redigera på Wikipedia (English: Editing at Wikipedia is not a permission). If I had thought about my behavior at SVWP, I would probably have """"skärpt mig"""" (pulled myself together?) and really shown who I really am.

I am a normal user, but I just want you to know I am completely aware of my behavior at SVWP, which caused my permanent block. But please, please leave me alone from ENWP now. I know I am welcomed back to SVWP in a little less than three years. I have been behaving better here during the last month or so, and I have completely stopped engaging myself in WP:SPI and reporting you at WP:AN/WP:ANI, but please focus on more constructive things than just mentoring and preventing me from getting tools at ENWP. I currently do not feel I need a mentorship from you. (Sure, if I am trolling somewhere at ENWP, feel free to revert it.)

 I'm short of time at the moment, and a lot of the policy and guideline pages have had their content shuffled around, but here is a recent template deletion discussion that illustrates some of the problems with SourceWatch as a reliable source. Beyond issues of bias, the main reason that open wikis are not allowed as reliable sources is that one can never guarantee what is going to appear on the screen at any given random time, when the source page is loaded. It could be good info, or it could be """"POOP"""". That is the main reason that Wikipedia is not allowed to source itself, and the principle holds for all wikis. As to the Drudge issue, I think that the arguments presented on Talk:George Soros in opposition to including well-sourced criticism from Bill O'Reilly apply here, and Eleemosynary was a strong opponent of including that information in the Soros article. The O'Reilly criticism is nowhere near as harsh and derogatory as the piece I removed from Drudge. O'Reilly is certainly more notable (as is his opinion) than the NYPress author. I really would like to see a consistent treatment of sources in all articles, and I try to apply that wherever I edit, but I already have about a thousand articles on my watchlist, so I can't fix everything. -  """,0.0

Portal:Architecture
Hello, are you interested in rotating the Portal every third week? 

Very nice pictures of Barcelona. May I nominate some for featured picture at Commons? Thanks  

You're right that it always needs updating in many ways. Don't forget also DYK and in the news (in the news we sadly seem to neglect the most). It would be nice to even rotate the SI and SAs on a shorter than 1 week basis sometime, I don't know if were ready for that yet even though we have something of a backlog developing in the nominations. What do you think of this, Hallidie Building? I found a picture for it finally, and need to substantiate the claim about the first curtain wall. I forget where I read that, but know I did somewhere. Once I remember and add a little more, it might be my first DYK. Best, + R/W 

 Proposal accepted - re: """"…so my proposal is:- perhaps you guys would consider lending a hand keeping those bits up to date and I'll rotate on the 3rd week. How does that sound?…"""" See also new toolbar, below. Feel free to edit if its useful. — (talk • contribs) 

Thanks! You can rotate the portal tonight, if you'd like to, or I'll get to it tomorrow, since I delayed two weeks now. — 

mosque to house
I think that will be more accurate. it's a pilgrimage site therefore a shrine... the use of mosque in the ref is used not in accurate fashion.  

Pilgrimage site and worship site. It is more accurately a worshiping site and muslims come from all over the world to visit it as it is one of the 3 holiest sites. Maybe having it Mosque for worship is enough and fair along with the word shrine.  

house of pilgrimage. if not, it's best to leave it. almaqdisi, stop stalking.  

I do not undersand. Mginnly is saying that there are many sources which mention it is a Mosque. This is true. Now you are discussing it is for piligrimage or worship. Pointless. Keep the word a Mosque only if pilgrimage will be an issue of debate too! No need to mention piligrimage or worship, just a mosque. And accroding  to the definition of a Mosque, it is a place of worship. In Mecca the piligrims go to worship in a Mosque called masjid al-Haram. But again, if this is an issue of debate, forget it and just keep the word Mosque along with the word shrine. Simple...  
it's by definition not a mosque. some refer to it as mosque because of pilgrimage. No, the article will never say in the lead that it's a """"mosque"""" because it isn't. Live with it.  

Alternate version will be to leave """"shrine"""" and in the end of the lead say something like """"Some refer to the Dome as a Rock as a mosque even though it isn't"""". That can be acceptable too.  

Amuros, please let us not repeat the stuff we did in several talk pages...! Any one can go to Google and find """"Dome of the Rock Mosque"""" or """"Mosque of Umar"""" to see that this is indeed a Mosque.! I will stop discussing this any further.

 Will Arbitration finally be needed to stop the bigoted attacks?  

I fear that certain editors here have not heeded the recent warnings whatsoever and are proceeding full steam ahead with attempting to make this Bible article a full fledged one-sided POV job, with insulting, inflammatory, and derogatory rhetoiric being directed at all those who take this story seriously.

We know there are anti-Christian and anti-Jewish bigots in the world: always have been, no doubt about that.  Why do we have to allow them to come here and spout their intolerance non-stop. The way these sad sacks look at Christians and Jews whom they always label with derogatory sounding labels like """"fundamentalist"""" and """"conservative""""  is reminiscent of the way Hitler felt about Jews except these mental dwarfs include Christians as well, involving a much greater proportion of the population as their target.

Even if we do merge analog stick into joystick, merging articles about specific controllers is barely even related. I think you are simply trying to make a point about the slippery slope, but such an article does exist: Gamepad.

Actually, looking at the articles has got me thinking; this is a very similar case. Analog stick can easily retain it's own article while having a significant mention in the joystick article (similar to the DualShock having a mention in the gamepad article, which likewise has a mention in the even more overarching game controller article). It has also made me think, """"wait a minute, the joystick article is about joystick controllers, NOT JOYSTICKS"""" if you see my distinction. The analog thumbstick can be seen as a type of input, while the things referred to in the joystick article are types of controller based around a joystick design.

The version that you keep reverting to is at least as anti-contra as the other version is """"pro-contra."""" The irony is that while the Sandinistas themselves have been willing to admit their errors and have reached out to win the votes of former rebels and their sympathizers, some of their foreign supporters seem to be stuck in their circa 1986 vision of Nicaragua. Some Wikipedia editors are holding to views about the contras that even the Sandinistas don't believe anymore.

For instance, while pro-contra editors like to emphasize the role of the MILPAS, anti-contra editors prefer to emphasize the role of former Guardsmen. Yet even Envio, in its February 1987 review of the contra war, noted that Dimas' MILPAS rebellion was """"the most serious episode"""" of the early part of the war.

On the other hand, your favored version reads that """"many members"""" of the old Guard were involved in forming early groups like the 15th of September Legion. But even writers who were hardly pro-contra, like Christopher Dickey and Roy Gutman, have noted how tiny these groups were.

Notability of Buffalo Zero
A tag has been placed on Buffalo Zero requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.  69.123.113.89  """,0.0

I question the very supposition that natural rights should be conjoined with legal rights, as I have recently brought up again below.  

The reasoning here seems to me to suggest that there is connection between the two (or at least to suggest in some way that there SHOULD or OUGHT to be a connection); this is a moral argument, not a legal one.  The POV is not neutral.  This question comes up in the very opening paragraph of SEP entry for legal rights, the issue: """"Whether legal rights are conceptually related to other types of rights, principally moral rights""""  [].  We need to talk about what is being inferred here by these two entries being together. I too believe the entries need to separated, as to link them suggests a direct link between legal and moral rights.

Perseus missile - Description or Characteristics?
Your lack of English comprehension is appalling. Your edit summary reads, """"the section here describes the missile, not just lists its characteristics. Standard way of naming sections on similar articles. Also, i would be happy to compare GRE scores"""". You are making this oh so easy for me, but for your benefit I will simplify things by hypothetically replacing the missile with a person. If I were to describe a person - perhaps on a police report - what would it entail? Height, weight, hair and eye colour, age? Yes, but I may also go on to describe the persons observable behavior, actions and tone of voice etc, to the best of my ability. This is a fairly standard example of what would fit a description. 

The articles original sub heading - Characteristics - encompasses a more diverse and flexible approach to the subject, for example distinctive features or a distinguishing quality unique to that particular missile (or person!). It goes more in-depth, a wider representation of the subject. However, as defining Characteristics are very descriptive in nature, it is easy and common these days to make mistakes, just as you have clearly made the mistake of getting muddled with the correct use of description and characteristics (as represent by your edit summary).

Difference between a description and a characteristic?
Description: He is tall, 6ft 6.
Characteristic: It is his height of 6ft 6 that distinguishes him.

 Taking this to your own talk page as you don't seem quite as keen on listening to what I've got to say over on my page as you are hellbent on defiling everyone's edits for your enjoyment 

Alright, I've just had it up to here with you and your blasphemous claims of everyone's edits being """"unreferenced crap"""" because you're the only one who can't remain content of having others contribute to the site. I can put up with your labels of every edit you find disastisfactory to your bigoted tastes as """"vandalism,"""" but going through everyone's freaking contributions list to make it some White Man's Burden to undo every small trimmings of blatantly incorrect or dingy information is just pushing the line, so I suggest you don't break the 3-edit rule yourself if you're so pompously insisting the rules and law enforcements here are on your side.

Let's see back where this started in the Freeza section, for example. Like I said on my edits page, I haven't familiarized myself with making those neat little references at the bottom to add to my edits, so in straight, bold text as clear as day, I posted the chapter number where the psychic ability itself was displayed, and could well post an image to back up my claims, while each and every one of the rest of the information I posted was seen throughout his extended fight sequences with Goku and co., you can bet your money on it; it's not Berserk or Blade of the Immortal we're talking about here, but plain-out, simple everyday Dragonball, which everyone (save you) would be fully capable of seeing. 

Then, the Vegeta article? Please, Vegeta himself professed about the 17 million zenos required to initiate his Ozaru transformation which can only be produced by a full moon or his power ball that mixes with the planet's oxygen to create a replacement, which both he and Gohan used to transform, and after his tail was sliced off by Yajirobe, he fled to the Freeza Planet and stated that his tail would grow back after he came out of the healing tank with the tail stump in plain view. None of this is uncited information by any means, and you're well striking a chord with everyone's anger by hellbenting on removing all that on the crappy pretense that because you can't deal with someone else making contributions, you're right in labeling them """"unreferenced crap"""" or """"vandal"""" and digging through everyone's records like a 40-year old wanker to annul every effort.

And again, the Piccolo article? I simply added that Nail was the one he first fused with to gain his """"massive increase"""" and that he was the one who kicked Freeza away to help buy time for Goku's Genki Dama to charge, and I myself removed some so-called """"crap"""" information like """"Piccolo's bukujutsu being a different technique"""" when the Japanese manga simply states that his technique is a superior kind. What little others there were (my contributions, I mean) are simple, medial additions like """"scientist Gero"""" added to the unclear information that simply said """"Red Ribbon"""" at first, when it was just the one guy and nobody else that was working for vengeance. 

And finally, I've been on this site since back in 2005 or 6 or so since I was 14 and fully know my rules and qualifications, and haven't been blocked once, so I'd suggest that you take it to my profile if you've got such a beef with my edits that you need to act like a petulant, 4-year old child who wants his toy back destroying everyone's contributions on your whim when you yourself are no authority.

 Censorship 

Was Final Fantasy VII censored at all? I mean, the content wasn't as strong as, say, Final Fantasy VIII's, but I would imagine something was censored. Plus, it doesn't say anything about censorship on this page. Could someone please answer to this? 
Not that I recall. It certainly wasn't censored as much as the older games were.  
As I recall, some language was censored, some wasn't.  
The word """"bastard"""" appeared on various occasions, but """"fuck"""" and """"shit"""" were censored.  
< recet indent
Some words were censored, some were not, which ones seem arbitrary.
Only instance I could find of """"Fuck"""" uncensored:
Computer: Cid! We have an emergency situation! A mechanic is still in the engine section of the rocket!
Cid: What!? Who is the little fuck!?
Computer: I don't know. Activating the intercom in the engine section.
Cid: Hey goddammit!! Who the #*$$#&'s still in there?
Earliest instance of """"Shit""""
Shinra Manager: I'm not give in to violence…and I'm not giving you my seat either!
Tifa: Barret!!
Barret: #^*$!! You lucky #$#*!
Cloud: So, what are we gonna do now?
Barret: Shit! The hell you so calm about? You bustin' up my rhythm…
In total, """"Fuck"""" is said uncensored once, """"Shit"""" is said uncensored 12 times, """"ass"""" is said 15 times (sometimes occuring as Jackass), """"Damn"""" is said 68 times, and I couldn't find any occurances of """"Bastard"""".  Censored words appear approx. 33 times.  
My version must be different.  The """"fuck"""" is censored, and the comment with Barret the last editor quoted, the first word was uncensored(though it had an apostrophe stuck in the middle, making it """"shi't"""".  I noted a lot of uncensored """"ass"""" and """"shit"""" though, and after playing FFX and FFXII for so long, going back and playing FFVII, I was a little surprised by the language.  In fact, it's the only Fantasy RPG I've ever played with uncensored profanity.  But yes, it was at least partially censored. 
 Nevertheless, unless we get concrete primary sourcing from an interview or whatever, we can't include this in the article. — er 
Well, the box says it's rated teen for mild language and violence...  But I'm not sure of any primary sources that would even deal with this particular issue.. 
Beyond a mention that there is some uncensored language I really don't think this type of info belongs in an encyclopedia.  And even the slight mention is iffy to me.   
Well, it's the first Final Fantasy to come to America with any uncensored language.  But then again, all the Final Fantasies to come to America in that period of time had to go through Nintendo of America's censorship guidelines of the time. 
It might be worth noting (at least in the discussion) that the computer version was far more censored than the PSX version. Almost every instance of """"shit"""" was removed, consistently with #^$& or similar characters. Also, certain important lines had their translations changed. """"Back then, you could get by with only skinned knees"""", for example, was changed to something likely more grammatically correct, but weird to a long time player of the PSX version.  

I have the PC version of FF7 and I recall a TON of Cid lines where there was censorship as well as ones form Barret. They were all situations of anger though so it didn't impact the storyline much.

Actually there was some sexual censorship if I recall. """"Slightly stretched underwear"""" was changed to """"Therapeutic underwear."""" Not sure why it's better, but I'm pretty sure they did it because they thought """"slightly stretched"""" was sexually inappropriate. (The item is found in Tifa's dresser drawer during the nibelhiem flashback sequence.)

During the epilogue that follows, the ruins of Midgar are shown five hundred years later. While the landscape had once been desolate due to Shinra's operations, it is now a land of lush greenery.

 Operation Northwords 
Listing Operation Northwoods as a conspiracy theory is bias and unfounded by the very definition of Conspiracy Theory that this article gives. If a conspiracy theory is a theory involving a """"coordinated group"""" which """"is, or was, secretly working to commit illegal or wrongful actions, including attempting to hide the existence of the group and its activities"""" then Operation Northwoods does not fit the criteria. First of all, the CIA does not try to keep its self hidden or secret. It is a known agency and the plans of Operation Northwoods are no more a Conspiracy Theory just because they where kept secret then any of its other actions that the CIA plans or performs on a daily basses that are all kept secret from the general public. Secondly, Operation Northwoods was not a conspiracy within the CIA either. Not one CIA member kept it a secret from anyone who should have known about it. It other words the protocols and the chain of command for this plan was followed precisely as they should have been. And because of that fact, it was shot down, the architect of the plan was fired, the plan never took action and it was well documented which is why we know of the plan under the Freedom of Information Act. This is the exact opposite of a conspiracy theory.   

 Conspiracism 

The section conspiracism says:

'Conspiracy theories are often not taken seriously, because so many conspiracy theories - almost by definition - lack readily verifiable evidence. 

This phrase is unnecessary to introduce conspiracism and is full of weasel words: """"often taken not seriously"""" (has anybody made a statistic?) """"many conspiracy theories lack verifiable evidence"""" (how many?) and it happens """"almost by  definition""""(??) what in the definition states tht the theory has to lack evidence???  

If nobody has nothing to comment about that I will delete the sentence above.  

I disagree with the above sentence - and for sure it is not neutral but  guess that it meant that the conspiracy groups hides the evidents and/or create them (vide the 9/11 passport [I don't want to argue was it fabricated - I mentioning that accorsing to some people it was fabricated]).   

 Sequence of sections and bias 

The way this article is set up suggests a very, very strong POV and it is not even really attempting to be neutral. First problem is the examples, for one they shouldn't be the second thing since it's mainly a partial list. This should be towards the end of the article. Also there is the descriptions:

The John F. Kennedy assassination was a plot by people in high places and not the work of lone gunman Lee Harvey Oswald. Oliver Stone's film JFK is based on this premise.

While this is a conspiracy theory, one I think is somewhat likely, it is actually the most extreme of conspiracy theories in this regard. Other theories were that this was a mob hit or carried out by Cuba or the Soviets. The UFO conspiracy theory is also stated in the more extreme manner. Some theories are that the U.S. government conceals an alien presence because they're afraid of it causing a scare, which sounds more reasonable than, """"to be used for war and other ideas, mainly towards the New World order.""""

Also the fourth section is almost completely dedicated to explaining conspiracy theories in a discrediting manner, treating them like psychological abnormalities or attempts by confused individuals to make sense of a nonsensical world. It seems to be the most common and most annoying criticism of conspiracy theories. This section also is half of the actual article, with the rest mainly being an explanation of the terminology and even mentions of fictional conspiracies. Very little of this article goes to treating conspiracy theories as a justifiable practice in critical thinking that like all legitimate studies can lead to rather ridiculous theories. For instance, there are legitimate questions about 9-11, such as the $100,000 given to Atta by a head of the ISI. There are also allegations that the 9-11 Commission due to its structure and the associations of its head with the Administration was unable to do a thorough and independent investigation, with it ultimately being little more than a coverup. In every case critical thinking demands some form of explanation or theory for such facts. For instance one is that the Administration is trying to cover up connections between Pakistan and/or Saudi Arabia and 9-11. This w",0.0

"Coat of Arms of Vermont 
Hi, I presume your request is related to my assessment of the article for the heraldry and vexillology wikiproject. My reasoning was basically that it was too long to be a stub, and didn't have GA status, which meant it had to be either Start or B class; since it was on the short side I went for Start. Having read it once again I can't immediately think of any content which could be added. This is a problem I have with all coat of arms articles; once you've said what it looks like, when it was first used, who designed it and any possible symbolism, there's really not much else you can say unless the arms are old enough that you can trace the historical development. Having said that, it would possibly be interesting to know why the state has both a seal and a coat of arms.

I would however take issue with your statement Vermont is the only U.S. state to have authentic armorial bearings described in a blazon. First, what do you mean by an authentic coat of arms? Are there states which use fake coats of arms? Also given that the arms are an example of landscape heraldry you might find people arguing whether they are actually 'authentic' arms. Secondly, a blazon is just a written description of a coat of arms; given a picture of a coat of arms someone sufficiently experienced in heraldry can produce a blazon, so there's nothing particularly unique about a coat of arms having a blazon. (In the European tradition it is in fact the blazon that defines the arms rather than the visual representation). Thirdly, if you want to get picky, blazon usually refers to the anglo-french jargon used to describe coats of arms, whereas the blazon of the CoA of Vermont is more like a layman's description, although it does throw in a few heraldic terms (I note that the external link you provide refers to the blazon as 'quasi-heraldic terminology'). Finally Vermont is not the only state which has a blazon enshrined in statute, see Coat of arms of North Dakota for example.

Regarding possible improvements, I would be inclined to add subheadings, e.g. history, blazon,Vermonter's badge. Also, now that you've added a couple of other sources it would probably be good to add citations to indicate which facts come from which source. The external link says that the arms were not defined by statute until 1862, but the article says differently; is the external site wrong? Quoting the statute numbers could possibly be useful. A couple more images could also be good, e.g. of the arms being used today, or historical versions showing the 'considerable liberties taken'.",0.0

 Pro-Gay Bias? 
To be honest, I am not sure I entirely follow. What is exactly is meant by holding a """"pro-gay bias""""? That I am in favour of homosexuality? This seems entirely nonsensical, and indeed strictly speaking to be """"pro-gay"""" would mean you hold that it is a superior sexual orientation that all should aspire to. To be quite honest, I think the whole notion of a """"pro-gay bias"""" is entirely homophobic, and used to paint those who accept different sexual orientations in a manner that suggests they desire to promote homosexuality. Clearly, the article has a distinctly homophobic bias. It portrays a homosexuality as abnormal and deviant, homosexuality as a """"post-industrial"""" cosmopolitan lifestyle, and homosexuality as the social norm. These are all strongly homophobic POVs which are rejected by those who accept different sexual orientations (i.e., the majority of society in the West, and specifically progressives and social liberals). Those who hold such beliefs are indeed social conservatives who defend traditional morality and particularly heterosexual relationships. Stating the views of social-conservatives as objective facts, without even engaging with the beliefs of the majority of society who accept homosexuality, is clearly and irrefutably extremely biased. As is the implication that homosexuality has supposedly """"increased""""  as a result of the  """"modern urbanity of the post-industrial age"""", when in fact it is irrefutably due to the increasing acceptance of people's sexualities that has occurred in Western society in the 20th Century.

Speedy deletion of Thomas Essomba
 A tag has been placed on Thomas Essomba requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page that has been nominated for deletion (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. Lastly, please note that if the article does get deleted, you can contact one of these admins to request that a copy be emailed to you.   –   """,0.0

"Gnip is on the right track here, though I would like to suggest a few corrections to his last statement. The reason the book received so much negative feedback from academics was not only because of its high profile, but it certainly did play a major role. Historians did definitely want to counter the widespread praise the book was receiving from journalists and other non-specialists, but it was also the book’s clear and obvious failings that drew a lot of attention from academics, who felt it was their responsibility to expose the book’s problematic research and unsubstantiated conclusions. Any work claiming to provide a comprehensive biography of one of the world's most famous (or infamous) leaders will get noticed, and will certainly be watched closely by academics specializing in China studies. As someone currently working within this very millieu, I can say that most specialists I know of have spoken to were at least aware of the book. Gnip is, however, correct that the published response to the book (such as the Benton volume, or the China Journal response) were unusual, as I have stated before in this article's discussion. I think this is the part that is getting lost on John Smith's, unfortunately. Though I may be splitting hairs rehashing Gnip's words, what I am trying to clarify is that people should not be under the impression that academics only noticed the book due it its huge publicity. It is not correct to say that without its ‘high profile’ “the academic world would [never have known] about such a book.” Professional historians deal daily with the “low profile”, often reviewing books that never become very popular or well-known (ie. they don't sell very well outside of academia). In fact, they frequently research and dissect works that few outside of a very small circle of individuals will ever read. In this sense, academics are very insulated in what they do, and are often disconnected from the general public. That is not to say, however, that they are unaware of new publications outside of academia, particularly those re-evaluating major figures in history. Also, Benton’s volume “Was Mao Really a Monster” was not, in my opinion, a major contributor to the book’s popularity, as Gnip suggests. As you know, MTUS was first published in 2005, and this collection of reviews was only published in 2009, quite some time after the book had already become popular (and as you know, the reviews found in the volume had been previously published elsewhere). What is important about this recent volume is not how it contributed to the book’s popularity, in my opinion, but rather as a reflection of how distressed the academic community truly is by the MTUS’s continued popularity. This last fact is what I am concerned does not quite get across in the article, as it stands. Unfortunately, I’m not sure how to appropriately correct that issue. I think that is what Midnightblueowl has been trying to address, and what I myself tried to do some time ago.",0.0

Sweden=

The legal actions taken by the Swedish royal family is according to the article in SvD not for his comments about Sweden in general, but for his comments about the royal family per se, and then especially his comments about princess Madeleine claiming she being indecent. 

Out of curiosity - does anyone know what these creatures (I won't have them in the same category as us humans) at WBC make of the United Nations? I can imagine they'll hate it, as they seem to hate everything in the universe, but it would be interesting to know...

I completely agree with the guy above me, but as this is an encyclopedia, why do we have to start an article about a schurch off with """"hate group""""?

Perhaps because these are a group of people who rejoyce when thousands of children die in terrible tragedies and come to funerals to yell vial things at the loved ones of the people that fought for their rights. What the hell should we start it off with? This is a local church that has very good after-school programs? 

Hatred of Islam and muslims, however despicable, is not racism, and neither is hatred of Catholics or Catholicism.  In general the racism section is pretty weak.  There is plenty bad to be said about Phelps without bringing the allegation that he uses the word """"nigger.""""  

Nice work.  Much better. I removed the NPOV tag. 

This article could be accused of not quite attaining NPOV, but it is clear that the writers have made an attempt to see this ridiculous crusade from both sides that is nothing short of heroic.  Patrick Beverley, 15 August 2005

Former Members of Westboro Baptist Church

The article has been updated with the following:

""""George Stutzman, Theresa Davis, Chris Davis, Karl Hockenbarger, Bill Hockenbarger and his wife, James Hockenbarger and Joshua Phelps-Roper are no longer members of the Westboro Baptist Church.""""

Where did this information come from? The Hockenbargers have been members of the church for a long time. I believe Chris Davis is married to Rebekah Phelps-Davis, one of Fred Phelps' children. His leaving the church would mean that he and Rebekah are no longer together. Joshua is one of the children of church spokesperson Shirley Phelps-Roper. His leaving would probably mean that he no longer has a relationship with his parents. (As Dorothea Bird once said: """"If you're in, you're in. If you're out, you're out.)

Hate group

Any chance of this article having a further early emphasis on it being a recognised hate group?

Lies

The westboro baptist CULT disgrace me. They hate catholics because they aparantly abuse children and are homosexuals. This is absolute lies and heavily offensive. The fact that they make up so much lies and how there actions are contradicted within the bible should be given more attention. Anyone agree?

Appearance

I remember an appearance by a woman and her children on the Howard Stern show... they were members of the Westboro Church, and in the few minutes I watched one thing that the woman said struck me as an interesting point: """"I don't hate fags, God hates fags,"""" or something to that effect.  And yes, Fred Phelps mentioned this subject in an April 2003 interview with BlackTable.com: (Here's the URL: -  08:56, 3 Dec 2004 (UTC))

 Well, since we're making a list, individual bootlegs don't need to be notable themselves, but I know what you mean, we need some standards for inclusion. As with the sketchy nature of bootlegs themselves, we need to make sure we included only actual bootlegs (I mean """"bootleg"""" in the traditional sense of the word). Generally, I would say if we can find enough information to write a short paragraph or so on it, then let's include it. Most of the sources for this information is going to be found on personal sites of collectors and not really verifiable, so I would say for every inclusion we should have at least two independent sources. Unless... you got a book on Who bootlegs. I tried to track down my friend's, but he couldn't find it. (

I'm sure you've found these sites already, but these are what I've been using.
 http://thewho.net/bootlegs/html/lp_list.html <- A little overwhelming at first, I know, but has the most bootlegs, including obscure variations.
 http://www.xmission.com/~legalize/who/boots/index.html <- Hasn't been updated in forever. Mentions The Who: The Illustrated Discography as his source, which I believe is what my friend's book is called.

I still need to do some research, before I starting putting together an article, so feel free to start it. I'm gonna try to get a hold of that book. I might just go an buy myself a copy.

Microbrewery
When the first sentence says """"Creemore Springs was a microbrewery located in..."""", it instantly suggests that the brewery no longer exists. While I understand that the author is trying to imply that Creemore would no longer be considered a """"microbrewery"""" (due to their ownership structure and level of production), I don't think this is the best wording.

Further point is that it is irrelevant to her entire life and career. So many Wikipedia articles aren't a proper biography, they're """"slap"""" from this media article, and """"slap"""" from that media article; based on the idea that it was said, or done, so it must be there (irrelevant of how petty or non-notable it is). It's why articles on modern-day 'extremists', whatever their creed, are so bad: because they're just conduits for media crap. (i.e. Something negative was said about the person at hand, so it therefore must be slapped in the article; this is done under the guise of it being """"notable"""", but it is, in reality, just an editor taking an oppourtunity to attack the person at hand.)

Do not think I'm blind. I see through the bullshit, whether it comes from you or the media. I haven't moved away from my earlier points because I'm sticking to my guns; I'm merely elaborating on them further in the hope to getting the point across to you and your comrades.

Firstly, Oceania is a geopolitical continent, not a biogeographic or geological one. From the geopolitical point of view, East Timor is in Asia. From any other point of view, Oceania doesn't exist. Either way, East Timor is not a part of Oceania.
Secondly, reputable sources have been presented, which state straight out that East Timor is in Asia. They may not state their criteria, but they are unambiguous in their position.

Camille Paglia: """"On the other hand I’ve been saying in public for five years ago, as someone who’s endorsed prostitutes and strippers and that whole extreme of sex-positive experience, that I’m concerned about the effect on young people – people growing up from 8, 10, 14 in a climate where it’s gone to the opposite direction. I’m already out there concerned about this so I’m really outraged to be stereotyped in that way by her because I am a career teacher and yes, when you have a situation where commercialised sex is being pushed without a true eroticism…I’ve been saying this for years, that we have got to a point of meaningless exhibitionism without real eroticism. I’m for eroticism."""" 

Camille Paglia is a major American social critic. Paglia's academic writing focuses on the role of vibrant dangerous sexuality in human history. Paglia's key importance to sex-positive feminism is not only her writings on sex, but her advocacy of """"traditional"""" values like canon texts. Paglia is somewhat of an intellectual enigma, a conservative and academic feminist, who revels in low and high culture alike and celebrates sexualities disapproved of by mainstream Western culture. Paglia has, in many ways, presented a """"respectable"""" face for pro-sex feminism to the world at large.""",0.14285714285714285

Heads Up  [Header, new topic]

User Borealdreams asked me for help here. He is now experiencing WP:BOOMERANG. One question; may I assume that your """"my client"""" comment was one of your typical edit summaries and not an indication of a COI? That's what it sounded like to me. Guy Macon (talk) 

The client is installing OPGW for their own purposes, I have nothing to do with the selection of the materials - but presumably the client knows what it's doing when it picked OPGW. Mere facts will not sway a Wikieditor. Besides, I'm well known for being in the pay of the Twisty Bulb Cartel. Wtshymanski (talk) 

If it comes up, I will be happy to attest to the fact that I have never seen any hint of COI in your edits. I have other disagreements with you, but there is no need to repeat them here.
I just saw a comment on my talk page that makes me think that there is some COI editing going on. Borealdreams wrote """"If the 'flat earth' mentality was removed, I wouldn't even need to mention my products directly by name"""". I am going to take this to COIN - probably tomorrow, I am a bit busy today.

@Hans Adler, truth and/or verifiability

Let's talk about truth and/or verifiability. You had corrected the name """"Stadtzeitung"""" we have in note #4 of this article into """"Stattzeitung"""", because only the latter was verifiable, you said. Then, by chance, somebody found out the link to the """"Stadtzeitung für Freiburg"""" and the erroneous correction could be reverted. Notice that if there had been no documentation of the """"Stadtzeitung für Freiburg"""" online, but only, say, in a press archive in Freiburg, or if nobody had made the effort to verify the verifiability, the error would not have been detected, and the """"truth"""" would now be, erroneously, """"Stattzeitung"""". A beautiful mistake, by the way, very evangelical, being of the same sort as those we can find in the manuscripts of the Gospel.   ;-)

But let us apply this to another case, take Anton van Hooff, who is in charge to turn King's evidence for """"pseudo-science"""", """"severe methodological flaws"""" and """"factual errors"""". Of course, he has written this, among several name-callings, so this is verifiable. But can we take it seriously? If we look closer we see that the first accusation of van Hooff towards Carotta was to not have taken into account the well known Tacitus-passage about Nero and the """"christians"""". But since Carotta had treated it in detail, van Hooff was exposed, because he had shown that he had attacked a book without having read it, so that he himself was convicted of the """"severe methodological flaws"""" and """"factual errors"""" he tried to impute to other people. The subsequent escalation with the accusation of """"pseudo-science"""" was only his embarrassing attempt to divert from the lack of professionality he had shown. This, too, can be verified. The question is then: Which verification is relevant?

Van Hooff is refered to as a """"Senior lecturer of Ancient History and Teacher Trainer for Classics at Nijmegen University, the Netherlands"""" in the link given in note #17. But we see that at the University of Sofia he is also called """"Professor Associate"""". Looking on the Internet we can verify that he is called a """"professor"""" on several websites. Looking closer we can also verify that he was never a professor, and is by now a teacher in a secondary school, as he himself stated in a newspaper article. So what have we truly verified? That he is a confidence trickster who let himself be called a professor without actually being one, in order to improve his authority as an alleged important scholar? If we look to the list of publications he is giving there, we see that he is speaking of """"numerous books and articles"""" but specifies only one title. Modesty or showing-off?

Van Hooff being a notorious polemicist, can his accusations be taken seriously? Nobody does it in The Netherlands (why is there no article about him in the Dutch WP? – The only Antoon van Hooff listed there is a zoo director, who was ashamed of the homonymy), but he is taken seriously here, in the English WP where most """"judges"""" do not even understand Dutch. Why? Because it is so stated in the German WP already? If we take a look at the history there, we can verify that somebody had first put the article in the category """"Pseudowissenschaft"""" (pseudo-science), but then, this being not allowed because libelous, they """"discovered"""" """"Van Hooff"""", taking him as """"proof"""", without examining his credibility, happy to have the possibility to maintain their libelous allegation in an appearance of legality: it is """"only"""" a quotation! ;-)

I have to plead guilty about putting technical discussions on these pages, but that was brought about because Pcarbonn wanted to argue every detail I tried to add.  Some discussion was necessary anyway because I assumed the article should be written for an 'average' user not familiar with the field, and some of the quoted comments needed some explaining for those readers.  

In agreement with the comments above, the article always was too biased towards the 'reality' of cold fusion, and I tried to make it less so, with the result that I was opposed at every step by Pcarbonn.  The general state of affairs regarding cold fusion today, as observed by myself as a worker in the field of the materials claimed to show CF, is that the average scientist thinks the issue was setled c. 1994, with CF being declared 'bad science' (or pathological or pseudoscience, they don't tend to distinguish between these various terms).  Almost universally (including me), these scientists when presented with current CF papers or statements say """"What? I thought that was over.""""  A very few are aware it is not, most of them are somewhat incensed that CF is NOT dead, and, at this point, only one (me) has actually studied the field and published conventional explanations (the other, W. B. Clarke, passed away).  This situation has allowed the CF die-hards to experience a resurgence of their view in the popular press, since not enough informed scientists are available to stop them (which is not a nefarious plot, they just do lousy science and rarely make it through a good peer review) and they actively suppress mention of the outstanding criticisms of their work.

Privacy of names

Caution should be applied when naming individuals who are discussed primarily in terms of a single event. When the name of a private individual has not been widely disseminated or has been intentionally concealed (such as in certain court cases), it is often preferable to omit it, especially when doing so does not result in a significant loss of context. When evaluating the inclusion or removal of names, their publication in secondary sources other than news media, such as scholarly journals or the work of recognized experts, should be afforded greater weight than the brief appearance of names in news stories.

Editors should take particular care when considering whether inclusion of the names of private, living individuals who are not directly involved in an article's topic adds significant value. The presumption in favor of the privacy of family members of articles' subjects and other loosely involved persons without independent notability is correspondingly stronger.",0.0

"Selena removed - here's why 

I see that Selena was on this list as having a stamp issued in 2006. I have removed her due to the fact that there were stamps, but they weren't issued by the USPS. The Selena stamps were issued by a company called Premier Postage. Their site claims to produce stamps using themes that are licensed by various folks that can be used as postage (the site also claims the USPS has authorized this). In Selena's case it appears her estate licensed her image to this company and they produced stamps. While these stamps may be valid for US postage, I feel she doesn't qualify for this list due to the stamps being issued by a private firm and not by the USPS.

 Misrepresentation of Eugenie Grandet's character 

The intro to this article says the Eugenie inherits her father's miserliness.  The end of the article states that she continues, as an orphan and widow, to live in his miserly ways, but without his obsession with gold.  This is not correct.

The one who inherits the miserliness of Grandet is Charles, his nephew.  Balzac states this explicitly near the end of the book when he says that this trait  """"found an outlet"""" in Charles, rather than his daughter.  Charles, grows from a callow and spoiled young man into a corrupt libertine and finally into a hard-nosed skinflint.

Eugenie, whose character is one of modesty, piety, and love, continues to live in the simple and austere manner of her upbringing, but she knows nothing else, and, having been betrayed in love, wants nothing for herself.  In tremendous contrast to her father, she is extremely generous with people, giving Nanon a fine marriage portion, distributing funds far and wide for charity, and endowing public institutions like libraries and hospitals.  Her personal austerity springs from a lack of interest in material comfort, not from miserliness.

Trying to poison the well by placing accurate detail on Blitzers AIPAC work next to the theories of Duke wont work. You wrote: 
""""It has been reported [reported AND recorded as fact in the American Jewish Yearbook 1977,78 directory listings] that Blitzer worked as a publications editor for Near East Research, Inc., a publisher [of the Near East Report weekly and compendium] affiliated with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee [with NER in fact described by AIPAC as an """"AIPAC periodocal""""], in the 1970s [from the early 1970s prior to joining JPost (see Friedman) to the late 1970s].

If you looked for Blitzers name in connection with the weekly publication and the 1976 edition of the book but found nothing then you need to ask someone with more research experience / less tunnelvision to go over your work again. Here is Blitzer being congratuated in the preface for Myths & Facts - A guide to the Arab-Israeli conflict 2006, for his prior service as editor of Myths and Facts; """"I would like to acknowledge the contributions of the distinguished group of past editors: Sheila Segal, Wolf Blitzer, Alan Tigay,..""""

Wikipedia:Changing username/Usurpations says that any unused username may be usurped if the user is given seven days notice to object and does not do so. 

If you have an email set in your preferences, you should be getting an email from a bureaucrat or changing username clerk explaining how to consent or object to this process. 

If you do not object to being renamed to a new username in order for another user to utilize the name you currently have, please log in and post a reply here saying so (you may also tell us what username you would like to be renamed to, or we will provide you with a generic one). 

If you do nothing: the request will be filled after seven days, and your account will be moved to a generic username. You may request that it be moved to a new username of your choice at any time.

If you object to being renamed: please log in and make an edit. You may make an edit here saying """"No,"""" you may make an edit to blank this page, or any other edit you like; making any edit at all prevents your username from being usurped, because users with edits cannot have their usernames usurped.

For example, if you said """"five plus five is thirteen"""", someone could objectively and neutrally criticise your ability at maths, and your conclusion, and prove you wrong, without having any biased point of view, or dubious agenda. Facts can be proven false or true, that is the rational basis of objective reasoning. Merely being critical is not a valid cause for rejection of the one criticising, as you manipulatively try and twist into its meaning with more ad hominem. You also ignore the hypocrisy of your argument, as Jehovah's Witnesses have masses of material heavily criticising other religions, so by your default, it should all be rejected as POV, biased, and highly subjective, and of little of no value. You have shot yourself in the foot Danny. You then go on with paragraphs of irrelevant red herrings, straw men, and more ad hominem character assassinations, in true Watch Tower fashion. You should read these Watch Tower articles on criticism and open-mindedness. 

You come out with even more logical fallacies, by mentioning subjects that do not apply, and hoping the less knowledgeable reader will fall for your 'guilt by association' machinations. You speak about """"disaffected individuals, apostates, and anti-cult movements"""", as if this somehow applies to Franz, when you have proven nothing. I'm sure I could get a host of quotes telling us all how sick and degenerate paedophiles are, and link that to you, and plenty of people would fall for that one if said over and over enough times, and the trick would have worked, no one would listen to anything you have to say if they believed you were messing about with little children. Your corrupt use of negative propaganda is disgusting, especially as you claim to be a Christian. I suggest you read your religion's articles on propaganda, you might learn to be more objective and less scheming in your arguments.

You then say: """"Especially suspect are """"Individuals who take up a cause for personal gain"""" by publishing books, etc."""" LOL, I nearly fell on the floor with laughter with that one! Hey, Danny, look in the mirror! The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society makes nearly a '$$$Billion$$$ US Dollars a year, a large part coming from its massive literature sales, most to loyal JWs. They also dodge paying their taxes on that massive income, this depleting the local community of needed funds (except in France where they have to pay their taxes, and are calling on """"Satan's European governments"""" to fight Jehovah's scriptural worldly tax arrangements, LOL). The greed of the publishing Watch Tower is terrible, but interestingly not a peep of condemnation from Danny about those Watch Tower """"Especially suspect 'Individuals who take up a cause for personal gain' by publishing books"""". Pure gold from Danny Muse!

You then go on: """"There are not similar books listed on the WP pages for the Catholic religion. . ."""" Since when did JWs love to link themselves with Catholics? Besides Catholics being a specially hated religion by Jehovah's Witnesses, it is completely different in its size, history and doctrines, and its treatment if those who criticise it. There are over 1 billion Catholics, and a 1500 year old religion, with massive tradition etc., why on earth would it be described the same as a 120 year old cult like prophecy obsessed group that treats its internal critics like demon possessed monsters, and then expels them and bans its members from",0.0

 If most Protestants were not 'informers' that would probably be because they had no information to pass on. However I think Sarah unwittingly and superbly illustrates the reason why using the word 'informer' in this article is utterly inappropriate and far from neutral.

Irish Protestants in the south then, or the north now would never use the word 'informer' in this context and their view should not be disregarded in Wikipedia.

 WP:FILM coordinator 

Hey, I saw your message concerning the upcoming elections for WP:FILM concerning the project coordinators and that you might be adding more. I'm a bit confused concerning the scope of their responsibilities. Is it largely updating , reviewing articles, and aiding in the establishment of task forces (at least as far as I can see)? Do coordinators generally specialize in various areas (i.e. one handles task forces, others reviewing, or a combination of any such duties)? If so, I was wondering whether I could specialize as a coordinator for featured lists. I rank second in terms of total featured lists made among all Wikipedians, and I have a very good grasp of what is required for FL status. If I was elected, I probably would work towards encouraging featured lists under WP:FILM's scope, and there certainly are a host of lists that could be pushed up to FL status with a coordinated effort. That said, I understand that I'm relatively new to the film project, and that there might be more suitable candidates who are more familiar with the project.

 External links on ballet 

Hello! External links are often taken as a """"For further reading"""" section, and as such, should complement the article, adding information we could not. As for ballet terminology, Wikipedia has a Glossary of ballet, and as we are working to create free content, it is more beneficial for us to create a better repository of terms and their meanings than to link to a copyrighted collection. Similarly, we shouldn't be linking to content which we should have, or which is only marginally related (physics of all dance is only marginally related to ballet). However, if you meant to reference a section, there's a different method of going about this documented at Wikipedia:Citing sources. The links used would be contained in a ==References== section, and it'd especially help if you could indicate which facts were verified and which weren't.

I'm going to complete the winter list in the coming weeks, I know a few editors have been working on it but I'd say there is still a good few missing so I may do the Elgin transfers after that, not promising anything. ★☆ ☆★ """,0.0

"""change my perception toward your edit. Freaking is so civil language? I don't think so. You ERASED the valid information regarding the criminal's original name. Non-English speakers adapt alphabet spellings from country to country if they translate or transliterate their native language into English. If the kanji are not given on the article, how do readers know which Japanese are """"the criminals"""" That's why I made the VALID revert you edit. Besides, what is 'instrumentalized'? I can't understand what you're saying.  

""""Freakin'"""" is either used instead of """"very"""", or when you are upset about something. It is not a bad word. For example: """"I'm so freakin' tired"""" (== """"very"""") or """"My girlfriend talks too much on the freakin' telephone"""" (==upset).
No, I didn't """"erase"""" the """"valid"""" information regarding the name. I forgot to re-add them after taking out the inappropriate interwikis (see also Wikipedia:Manual of Style (Japan-related articles)#Linking to Japanese Wikipedia)
Anyway, so what? You could have just re-added it it yourself. Which would have been polite and saved everyone a lot of time. 
And, reverts are for vandalism etc (see WP:REVERT policy), not for reverting edits just because you don't like it. So, not valid. 
Secondly, I *did* re-add it myself. But you reverted anyway. No excuse because you did not read! So, again, not valid.
""""Instrumentalize"""" means to (mis)use something. For example, the way newspapers used a war story for propaganda effect. They """"instrumentalize"""" horrors of war to show how """"great"""" their soldiers are. Do you understand what I mean?
   

Hmm.. This is so wasting my time to hear your unreasonable complaint. So you keep denying to acknowledge your mistake as erasing the info first. If you had been cautious about how people judge what is valid per edit history, you can't accuse me of reverting it without any reason. That is it. You can re-add your wordings without erasing the critical info.   

My """"unreasonable"""" complaint? What is my complaint? That you didn't read? That you violated every point in WP:REVERT#Do not twice?
No, I am not denying having made the mistake in the first place. I have already said this three times. 
But you should have fixed it yourself! Improve articles! Don't destroy the work of others. And do not assume that other people are being destructive.
I should not have to be """"cautious about how people judge what is valid per edit history."""" 
I should not be assuming that people are poor judges, because that would be bad faith in others.
I should be able to *expect* that people will *think* and *read* and work together to make Wikipedia a good place and a good resource. 
I should not expect bad things. I should not expect editors to revert. Reverts are evil! They destroy goodwill.
If you have goodwill, then you should now fix the article yourself. Or at least say sorry!

Oh I have gone ahead and done this. I think that page can be deleted now. There wasn't much on it. I hope you are happy with the way things are set out now. 

About the structure of the article generally, I have a few points:

I think that there should be a section for each daughter section, and that this should pretty much just be a quick rundown of that page, of the important parts in that page.
The 'research into health benefits' should be moved to the third party page, and only one study mentioned briefly on the main pagethe one that appeared in a journal, the other maybe should not be mentioned. Does not warrant a section to itself, at any rate. (will just go ahead and do this now)
Take out epoch times section. It is related to Falun Gong, but it is not of the same nature as the other sections, like beliefs and teachings, falun gong overseas, persecution etc.. There can be some 'related pages' mention of it, I think that would be appropriate, but basically it is not specifically a part of the Falun Gong cycle of articles, though related to them.

Oversourcing
Hi, I thought I should explain why I reverted the edit you made to Warwick Castle, especially considering it takes a lot less effort to hit the revert button than it does to go through and prune references. I understand that you were consolidating references since just one is used for most paragraphs. However, per WP:V """"material challenged or likely to be challenged, and all quotations, must be attributed"""". Therefore I think it's better to have a generous amount rather than just one per paragraph. Moreover, if someone was to add information to the article from another source it could wrongly appear that all the information in the paragraph before the reference comes from the new source (unless of course the editor was careful to duplicate sources).

There are lots of definitions of terrorism but none of them are """"accepted"""". Every definition is disputed by somebody. That is the reason many news agencies don't label any attacks as terrorist attacks and nor should we. Investigating and adjudicating as to whether a particular incident falls within the US State Department definition of terrorism (for instance) when the State Department itself has not given it's opinion on the subject is most definitely Original research. Remember that an argument can be made that the Boston Tea party could qualify as a terrorist incident under some definitions. That is why I am suggesting we list all notable violent incidents and ongoing conflicts and let our readers decide whether they want to call a particular incident terrorism. This would let us include the 2011 Tucson shooting for instance without having to determine the shooters motive. We could also include incidents like the 2010 Kingston unrest even though that was criminal, rather than political, violence.   """,0.0

"Proposal to delete part of page 

I think it would be reasonable to delete the text below:

There is  contemporary Rubaiyat is by the Iranian poet SALAH AL-DIN IBN BIN DEEN called The Rubaiyat of SALAH AL-DIN IBN BIN DEEN This Rubaiyat uses a number of patterns ie AABA, AAAA. This Rubaiyat uses erotic images to explore a range of mystical experiences. The use of erotic imagery was  commonly used by Sufis in Sufi poetry. SALAH AL-DIN IBN BIN DEEN is well within this Sufi tradition 

Thy red flushed lips pouting moon-flower
Clutch the bee in thy humid bower
Entangled deep he cries for more
As thy wines nectar on him shower

Oh cup bearer bring thy wine don’t refrain
Up lift   thy porphyry cup that I may drain 
My lips to thy lips jar
Lips on cups rim I sip again and   again

Up turn thy cup cup bearer turns
Thy wine hotter than Karkhiya burns
The wine drips fromst thy hole like molten glass
It rim froths with bubbles in my lips churns

The text above may or may not be truthful in its claims of the Persian poet's existence; in any case the poet and translator are both non-notable as far as I can tell; the poetry, furthermore, is quite bad (at least in English; I don't know about the putative Persian), and the explanatory sentences don't inspire confidence in the writer's clarity of thought. The use was commonly used? Sufis used this technique in Sufi poetry?

Why not delete it all? If we do include it, the passage we quote from the new Rubaiyat should not be three times longer than our quotation from Fitzgerald's/Omar's.

Apology accepted, however even if the characterization is accurate for other editors, it serves no purpose in bringing it up.  Making disputes personal rarely enhances dialogue.  Anyway, I think you've concluded basically the same thing I have: such a broadening of definition would include many people who really should not be considered philosophers.  Consider, for instance, Ayn Rand.  She wrote on the topics of metaphysics, ethics, etc, but she did so rhetorically and without actually attempting to prove her points using syllogistic logic.  She contributed nothing to human knowledge, both because her reasoning was fallacious and because any of her actually valid conclusions had already been documented by previous philosophers (for instance, """"objectivist"""" metaphysics are simply a renamed naturalistic metaphysics).  I don't mean to group Dawkins with Rand of course as Dawkins is, in my opinion, a brilliant man who has contributed much to human knowledge.  But this is my point: using such a broadened definition puts Dawkins, Rand, Kant, Mill, and Russel in the same category, which I think is prima facie an incorrect grouping.  

Now, as to your point that philosophers will favor their own: well yes, but the same should be said for biologists and physicists.  When we write an article on evolution we value the discoveries of biology and not of religion.  Philosophy is and basically always has been an academic enterprise, starting with the post-religious works of the Sophists/Plato/Aristotle/etc as they founded the world's first philosophical academies.  Since then the practice of philosophy has undergone many manifestations but even among those differences it is generally somewhat easy to tell what is philosophy and what is simply on the subject of philosophy but not actually philosophy.  For instance, the analytical school of philosophy, I think, should not hesitate to consider continental philosophy something other than philosophy, it is just considered to be incorrect (being very general here).  From a Wikipedia standpoint, encyclopedias themselves are an academic enterprise and as such when we're considering how to assign WP:WEIGHT to a subject we do so by reference to experts in that subject.  Whether rightly or wrongly, the experts on philosophy have yet to recognize Dawkins as a philosopher, but as WP editors our job is not to determine whether or not Dawkins is really a philosopher, but rather to consider the expert opinion on the matter and give due weight to minority views when appropriate. talk """,0.0

"Within this discussion page, I have sighted pseudo-justification for the formatting and substance of the Biopsych introductory paragraph quoting Webster’s Dictionary. Clearly, unless such source can be proven to be entirely free of advertorial motive then it ought not to be counted as a neutral source.

If as it appears, that Webster’s dictionary is the primary source of the informative substance of the introductory article, then surely Webster’s Dictionary should be cited as being the source within the opening paragraph itself. It is not proper to quote any source that has been approved merely on the basis of any unqualified assumption on the part of the current editors.

Surely a far better way to proceed with the introductory paragraph would be to quote authoritative sources either from within the field of Biopsych or otherwise having peer-related relevance. The impression that the introductory article presently creates is that of a messianic pharmaceutical cult seeking ‘out of the blue’ to command the co-operation of a wide range of medical and scientific disciplines.

Before proposing changes to the introduction, I would like the views of the current editors. Incidentally, I neither have an ‘anti-psychiatry’ agenda nor am I a ‘Scientologist’. Neither therefore am I aware of why the very mention of the word ‘Scientologist’ is met with such disdain within these pages.",0.0

This book just shows the name of Fan noli in a greek version but as showed from the encyclopedia Britannica and other myriads of sources his name is Theofan Stylian Noli .  Now everything is fine . 

Also in the talk page some other users ( not alexikoua or Dr.K ) had used a source and claimed that it showed  Theofanus Styalianos mavromatis but upon checking the source it was showing  Theofan Stilian noli as well .

"Issue with Map 

Using the light green color for Crimea seems somewhat misleading and inconsistent. The China map uses the same light green color for Taiwan, even though the situations are not similar at all: China has no control over Taiwan and the people don't want to join China. Russia has total control over Crimea with the approval of its people. In reality Crimea is not a contested territory, except in the minds of politicians. I think Crimea should be labeled as fully part of Russia on the Russia page, and marked with some other color on the Ukraine page that represents territorial claims without control. This should be the same color used for Taiwan on the china page. A different color should be used to mark contested territories (where multiple parties have actual influence over, say if Crimea was controlled by Russia, but its people were not happy with the Russians and were protesting/rebelling).",0.0

They reverted my contributions, deleted my hard work, gang edited my stuff, refused to compromise or in any way work for anything but their own dictatorial will. Now I'm motivated to be as asinine and ignorant as they are. I'm wholesale deleting anything without a source or reference. I'm disallowing references I personally feel are insufficient.

To Huon and Stephan2 ' At the present time I do not agree with either of your positions regarding the use of images on the Sergio Franchi biography. First of all are enough images."""" I do not believe that editors should be concerned with the absolute number of images. I do not believe that pictures which represent different aspects of a person's life are excessive. On the Filmography I used lots of images because Franchi was in a lot of TV productions. On the biography page, I am sure I could remove a few images, but our culture is image-driven and I used the images believing that their use would draw attention to this person's life. Dying before the advent of the internet his memory was almost allowed to die because none of his contemporaries carried his story onto the internet..thus my desire to preserve the biography of a person who was very important during the late 20th century in musical and theater history. As for my own motives as an editor of Wikipedia, I have used my work on these pages to increase my expertise as a Wikipedia editor, and have made contributions on every page that I felt competent to add at the time. This has also increased my editorial knowledge.  Enough about personal motivation. As to the issue at hand... Wikipedia's biography portal describes a biography as """"a detailed description of someone's life. More than a list of basic facts [education, relationships, and death)....a biography ...highlights various aspects of his or her life...."""" THAT is why I believe that the non-free image depicting Franchi's beloved avocations were deserving of representation in the 2 photos showing his automobile and pewter collections. I also felt that a textual statement would be enhanced by the 2 photos that I had discovered. As to the Non-free book cover depicting Sergio Franchi's 18 months of his life on the Broadway stage musical """"Nine'..as you are aware, usually only the original creator of the role is given fair space. However, his role was considered import enough by the producers to warrant new posters, programs, and an original song...I believe that the visual reminder of his impact on musical theater in 1984 was important. There were no other free images available after 1976 when the copyright law regarding publicity photos. I am interested in improving as an editor, and if you still believe that I should remove the Library of Congress image (Pewter collection), I will comply with your suggestion. Please consider my argument on it's retention. Thanks  

 to Huon regarding Categories: I agree that there are not enough articles to have a separate category for Sergio Franchi at this time. I am really interested in learning how to use categories. I am just starting to try and add articles on """"Sergio Franchi Albums."""" I have committed to being a part of Wiki Project Albums., and even using examples from other artists in my sandbox, I cannot get a handle on how to start my first Album article, add the Category """"Sergio Franchi Albums""""...or albums that I have planned on other important artists. I have read the pertinent articles...and have hit a road block. Any Concrete help would be appreciated. Thanks  """,0.0

"John Cena's wrestling abilities
John Cena is the worst in ring performer that I have ever seen, and quite possibly the most ridiculous champion the WWE has ever had! Firstly, he has no variation to his moveset, and aas the ECW crowd rightly said at One Night StandSAME OLD SHIT! Its not like the moves he has are even good, for hi to continue using them. Although Cena is a good entertainer, quite frankly he is the worst wrestler I have seen in my life, and as for him having a World Title reignI think it is absolutely preposterous. He shouldn't even be in the WWEOVW should suit his mediocre, half baked, sloppy wrestling style better. ( )",0.14285714285714285

Blocking me
I dont understand you're motivation for blocking me. You say I made personal attacks and the link I followed was the Qiyamah talk page..I presume you mean my comment that Universaliss was vandalizing it. Im not sure if you were confused or simply refrained from viewing his last two edits. His last two edits were what motivated me to my accusation. He replaced the page with utter nonsense. After you blocked me you didnt even rv his vandalism! I assume your decision to block me was an accident...but it does seem suspect...especially considering your recent and persistent need to engage me in convos which really dont concern you (Woohookity and that vfd consensus). I read your comment at southerncomfort's talkpage and I think you should know that I have not mislead her as i have never talked to this user. You said you blocked universaliss for a week...do you mean you blocked him/her yesterday and this will last for a week? No matter. I simply want that user to stop 1. reverting to old-outdated versions of the page which contain grammatical and technical inaccuracies, 2. stop the personal attacks, and religious attacks (towards Protestants, Jews, and Ahmadis), 3.and stop deleting information that he/she disagrees with. I really dont think this is asking that much. In terms of diffusing the situation...I tried to add in a passage that all parties could agree to. His response was too massively delete info in various sections and add in comments like """"you fucking troll"""".  03:26, August 1, 2005 (UTC)""",0.14285714285714285
