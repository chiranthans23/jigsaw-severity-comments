''Blindly sticking to policy in the face of all the facts is shockingly closed-minded.""""
I ask you—what is a 'fact'? It is something that we can prove to be true. How do we prove it to be true? With reliable, verifiable sources. And what do those reliable, verifiable sources say? That Alonso has an existing contract with Ferrari and that he is considering his options for 2015.

You want to remove Alonso from the table so that the article is representative of reality. If so, that change will need to be supported by a reliable, verifiable source in which Alonso himself says that he will leave Ferrari; alternatively, you can find a source from a senior Ferrari figure—be it Marco Mattiachi or Sergio Marchionne—saying the same thing. To change it prematurely suggests a fundamental misunderstanding of key Wikipedia policies, including no crystal balling, no original research and the need for sources that are reliable and verifiable.

Content issues

There are emerging guidelines within the Indigenous peoples WikiProject that I have begun to apply across the board for BC First Nations.  The main one is that there are different types of articles, even when their content and location/people may seem to overlap (I'll sign each section/paragraph so comments on specific points can be made easily: 
""""Ethno & Culture"""" articles
Not as loose as it sounds, despite having to describe it like this: """"ethno/history/culture/peoples""""
which this article, as titled, would fit into.  These articles get Category:First Nations in British Columbia, with """"First Nation"""" here meant in an ethnic sense, not in a governmental-org one.  Ideally these will always be simply named, without """"Nation"""" appended, as with Secwepemc and Nuu-chah-nulth - or Stó:lō  (variable forms like Nuu-chah-nulth-aht can be redirects, although that term can include the Pacheedaht which normally wouldn't want to be called Nuu-chah-nulth). 
Government articles
bands/First Nations, tribal councils, treaty groups) which have government-related content, ranging from chiefs and councillors, affiliations, treaty issues, modern demographics, economic and social issues, and so on  These articles get Category:First Nations governments in British Columbia.  In the case of the Stó:lō the main government article is going to be (created in a few minutes...): Stó:lō Nation, and will list all its subgovernments; """"Indian Band"""" and """"First Nation"""", sometimes just """"Nation"""" are all interchangeable, although some bands seem to have a preference (at different times, given by variable content on various website sources); whatever is picked.  Non-Indian Act-based governments can be and should described under different titles, either in the ethno type or in the history type (see below) 
language articles
'nuff said, but can be titled either in native language (St'at'imcets) or in the form Shuswap language; Wiki guidelines, it should be stressed, prefer the latter (use English, which is the language of the encyclopedia...).  Some ethno and gov articles will have more than one language listed in their cats; some languages span more than one gov group, or in the case of the Sto:lo and Chehalis, two different ones.  Cats for this are specialized in the linguistics hierarchy (examples later), but they should generally all take the relevant nation-category if there is one Category:Secwepemc, Category:Stó:lō, Category:Syilx etc. 
Community/Reserve articles
Communities, reserves/IRs, towns that have significant native presence also; there is a difference, note, between the physical object of a reserve, and the band government that runs it; the descrption of the reserve is here, that of the government; even though this will not just overlap with the government articles but also the ethno/peoples ones; just interlink everything and it will sort of make sense; it's just a question of what was being searched for; the Scw'exmx and Spaxomin bands are all listed under Nicola Tribal Association, for instance; but the latter article is about the association, not about the communities; similarly, Shackan and Nooaitch are communities as well as reserves, but articles about them should focus on the community's particular history, not on overall Scw'exmx culture.  In the case of the Sto:lo, there is another issue of """"where to fit the Chehalis"""" as they are in the same cultural/language area, but they are not Sto:lo by organization or by their own appellation.  Or the Tsleil-wau-tuth who are culturally Skxwxu7mesh but are part of the Sto:lo Nation (or were, last time I looked); so there's some confusing bits here and there.
""""Mythology"""" articles
User:OldManRivers has pointed out the """"mythology"""" articles and the cats that go with them; awkward wording/titling but in the absence of anything more workable, that's all there is for now.
History/Biography articles
there is another sort-of category for specific history articles, e.g. Chilcotin War, Fraser Canyon War and various bio articles (Simon Gunanoot, Slumach, Klattasine etc.) where Category:First Nations history would be appropriate as well as either Category:First Nations leaders or Category:First Nations persons; there's also different cats like Category:Conflicts in Canada which may apply, or Category:Wars involving indigenous peopels in North America, which was specifically titled to allow inter-native wars as well as wars between native peoples and non-natives; and without the """"Native American"""" wording that that category at one time had",0.0

Hi Johan. Why do you keep deleting the link to video featuring Hakan Mild?? You write, """"it's irrelevant to the article"""". Great, if the article was about Nuclear Power Plant, I'd say too, the video about great Swedish football player Hakan Mild, showing his AMAZING skills with the ball, is irrelevant to the topic. But the article about Mild... so what's wrong with the video about the very guy the article is written about, Johan?? ) Seriously, I wonder why do you delete it. Please, think again, let's put a link to the video so all the people who visit this Wikipedia page (and Wikipedia's pages are first to be found in all search engines, so everyone who likes to know more about Hakan Mild, would visit this page first) would see an amazing skills of the guy.

 Ok, we're moving towards a solution, so that's good. As for the Tang dynasty (though I think you mean it more genral), I think that Taiwan did not form part of the Tang empire. Anyway, there's nothing against mentioning the Tang dynasty at Taiwan as well.

 We may indeed specifically include (in the history? header? """"disclaimer""""?) that the PRC avoids linking its name to China. Then again, it may de-link it formally, but all those people around the world will continue to associate the two. 

 I'll await your remaining problems with the contents, confident we'll end up with an article that satisfies the both of us (and, hopefully, """"everybody else"""").  13:07 Aug 5, 2002 (PDT)

Guys, after reading this tedious list of conversation, my sugguestion of the best way out of the naming convention of China is using those by native speakers of Chinese. As a native speaker of several dialects of Chinese, I make the following table which should help: 

How native Chinese speakers refer to:
Speakers from
Mainland China
Taiwan
HongKong
Macau

Referring to China (Mainland)
China
Mainland (daliu)
Mainland or Zhongguo Daliu (chong-gua-da-lok in Cantonese)
Mainland

Taiwan
Taiwan or Taiwan Province (the more official tone)
Taiwan
Taiwan
Taiwan

China (the culture etc., non-political issue
China
China
China
China

Most Chinese, regardless of where they are from, care less about the naming convention but some Taiwanese (like my buddy who is gonna marry next month) DO NOT WANT Mainland China to annex Taiwan and had bad impression on Chen Shuibian.

 Knowing what the Chinese call it is certainly interesting, but what is important is what the English-language people call it. 

I'm with Jeronimo. I also thought all of this already had been resolved  China should be the main article of the PRoC. It doesn't matter what they officially call it or want it to be called. English speakers call it China in overwhelming numbers. This is also the conventional short form used by the CIA and the UN and we have decided that that is what we will use for country names here. If we don't stick to that then we are expressly taking sides in political naming issues. The fact that the PRoC is currently trying to dissociate their government from """"China"""" (which seems counter intuitive for a totalitarian regime..) is an interesting thing to mention in the article on the PRoC at China. If we change the name of the article to follow political correctness of the PRoC that is an express act of support for their policy. I for one say we defer such naming matters to higher authorities such as the CIA Factbook, the UN and especially what is most commonly used by English speakers. True they are POV institutions but transcribing what they use is a passive and not express act of POV. Wikipedia is not in the business to decide what the names of nations are  other institutions are far better suited at this highly charged topic. I also think the disclaimer is way too long and bold should be replaced by italics. Any article on the PRoC sho",0.0

Hi, """"see also"""" sections should not contain links to articles that are already linked to in the main body of an article (see WP:MOS). The whole section should therefore be removed from Democracy & Nature. Also, it's fine to list editorial board members, if there are independent sources that document what these people did for the journal. Most editorial board members don't ever do anything for a journal, so unless there are sources, we don't list them, no matter how notable they are. The same goes for contributors. If you want to tell readers that John Doe contributed to a journal, you will need an independent source that confirms that this was a notable contribution. It is not enough that John Doe himself is notable. Please see our journal article writing guide and WP:NOTINHERITED. In addition, WP does not allow original research and/or synthesis. So unless you have independent reliable sources, all those """"references"""" to the journal itself and claims that """"significant debates"""" were ignited will have to go. Thanks.

 Krokodeilopolis 

Given the etymology of crocodile, """"pebble man/worm,"""" I conjecture that the Greek city name sould be Krokodeilopolis, rather than Krokodopolis, because the man/worm morpheme of the latter seems overly syncopated.
That would be good to correct, but any references?  

Article removed from Wikipedia:Good articles

This article was formerly listed as a good article, but was removed from the listing because there aren't any references.  Otherwise it's great.   

I used entirely on-line sources when I wrote the article. Since I have a bit of a bias against that, I labeled the section external links. But looking it over again, the sources aren't too bad  while it could certainly use some print sources and footnoting (now that we have the new tags), and the mythological sources are at best weak, the technical information on the Nile crocodile is from reasonably strong secondary sources.  

 Pictures of crocodiles 

I would like to add my page on crocodiles to your external links please:

 Editing 

Some slight clean-up and rephrasing of Introduction to remove redundancies.  

 """"No animal is safe, even big cats

For some reason, someone continues to add this sentence when it makes no sense in the context of the article. The preceeding sentence states that elephants and adult hippos are """"safe"""" from crocodiles so it is erroneous and contradictory. Furthermore, lions are listed among the animals in the next sentence so the big cat reference is not necessary. This sentence should remain deleted from the page as it is redundant, contradictory, and overall not useful.  

Maybe you are right. Wording can be changed.  

 Crocs and Birds 

The Egyptian Plover and Spur-winged Plover are both claimed to clean crocodile teeth. A photograph of this behaviour would be useful.  

 """"Eyption Butts

 Hcobb and NPOV redux

I feel the need to revive the discussion of Hcobb's POV edits, especially with regards to the F-22 and F-35 articles. He has reinserted content that was previously removed because of question to its weight. Now, as the editor who initially removed that content, I'm open to discussion and defense of it should Hcobb wish to do so, but his edit summary on reinserting it was only """"Noting other shoe dropping."""" That is not a counter or a defense. When I removed his content again, he responded with his characteristic outlash on the talk page that made no attempt to connect his comments to the edits he is complaining about. He did so with a highly inflammatory thread title that was directly opposite to the claims made by his own source. I have since responded and renamed the thread title. On F-35, he continues his campaign of attacking edits on the subject, even so far as inserting content that, when he brought it up on the talk page, had little support and was directly questioned.

 Worst Season ever 
Anyone who likes Seasons 4 and onward have obviously NOT seen any of the old episodes from 1999-2004 and therefore is a total dickbag. I can never tell you how much I HATE the new SpongeBob!!! Nick had stopped caring about good animation and started caring only about the cash the SECOND they started this show. The old ones are great, while the new ones, I'd give an F plus 500 million minuses! I'd be so damn shocked if anybody even likes these new episodes, because anyone who does is downright retarded. It's like all Nick's staff wants to do now is win themselves a bunch of hot girls!

When the stooges at Nick began this show, it was nothing but great humor for 5 years. Now, SpongeBob's crew had lost ANY sight of what """"good quality"""" is all about! The writing is totally fucked up! I mean, Seriously, """"For Here or To Go""""? Who the fucking hell would watch an episode about taking orders at a fast food restaurant deciding whether or not to eat it at the restauraunt or home? I know there are now just copying off ideas of old episodes. Ex: Petsitter Pat. Patrick says the bath is gonna come to Gary. That's EXACTLY what SpongeBob said to Gary in """"Gary Takes a Bath"""", but that version is WAAAAAAY better than this new junk that anybody likes is mentally challenged and obviously hasn't watched the first three seasons! Even true SpongeBob fans should only like Season 1-3, because no episodes past that were even remotely decent. And I know for a fact it will never be as good as it used to be. I'm 100% certain that is true. ANYBODY who likes anything of the Post Movie era is just either brain-dead or childish. Stephen Hillenburg really knew quality, but now we just have a bunch of screwed-up polesmokers who only want the money. And NOTHING else! They're just like fucking Mr. Krabs clones! Paul Tibbit must be drunk or something, and Tom Kenny must have swallowed a slide whistle, because now SpongeBob is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING EXCEPT FOR UTTER GARBAGE THAT IS ALL BUT INTOLERABLE!!! Like I said, I cannot believe there are people that actually LIKE these new episodes! Everybody that likes Seasons 4-8 smoke too much crack! Anybody who's into the new SpongeBob doesn't know shit about quality if it hit him square in the ballsack! All I can say is, I am SO RELIEVED this show is ending in 2014. Only 2 more years of this trash that I will have to sit through! If they make a SpongeBob Channel, they should only do reruns of the first three seasons, because absolutely nothing afterwards was good. So there goes 7 years of my life I know I will never get back. I am not going to wait too much longer for them to cancel this unfunny garbage, because it needs to happen soon.71.74.87.105

I believe that the microscopic treatment this article has received is evidence of bias against its subject matter, while the simple fact is clear that this surgeon is referenced repeatedly in other wikipedia articles about related surgical topics. In  addition, the very nature of the subject matter should be protected a topic given the level of bigotry, discrimination, and violence including murder against people who receive these medical treatments. The very fact that a surgeon like Toby Meltzer, with such a prestigious medical background, chooses to concentrate on such service to other people, who have few if any equally qualified alternatives, is notable by itself, without need for any further citation. These surgeries are in and of themselves pioneering, and largely non-existent on any measurable scale before the 1960s.

So I will start with a criticism of the quote from Ollier and Pain, with whom I have more general issues than the """"postorogenic part"""". Phrase by phrase that I disagree with:
 Only much later was it realized that the two processes [deformation and the creation of topography] were mostly not closely related, either in origin or in time. Very wrong. Deformation causes topography, and the generation of topography is synchronous with deformation. I will email you a copy of Dahlen and Suppe (1988), which shows that this is the case - send me a message so I have your address and can attach a PDF. They tackle the large-scale deformation of sedimentary rocks via folding and thrusting during orogenesis.
 ...fold-belt mountainous areas...: """"fold-belt"""" isn't used professionally (AFAIK) to refer to a collisional mountain-building event. A minor thing though.
 Only in the very youngest, late Cenozoic mountains is there any evident causal relation between rock structure and surface landscape. and the following sentence: If I were British, I would call this """"utter twaddle"""". As I mentioned above, there is no way for many of the exposed structures to get to the surface without large amounts of rock uplift and erosion. And as a matter of fact, the trajectory of different units of rock through an orogen is in part determined by patterns of surface erosion. To keep it simple and send you one paper, you'll find this in and at the end of the paper by Dahlen and Suppe (1988).

<<  It clearly shows in the history that others furthered the breed by taking them to America and England. Thus the same with the Shiloh Shepherd. Some facts: While the ISSR was founded in 1991 as the first Shiloh registry, it was only 6 short years later that the first non ISSR registry and club was formed. Thus the ISSR was only the sole Shiloh Registry for 6 years while there have been non ISSR registries for 8.  >>

TINA'S  REPLY

ROTF ... Talk about """"smoke & mirrors"""" ... WOW!!  Now let's look at some *varifiable* FACTS!

1. The ISSR was formed to CONTINUE the data collection that I started in 1974!!  When it was set up I had documented data on MY breeding stock going all the way back to the 60's ... all of this was incorporated into the ISSR database!!  Therefor ... the information that we have goes back for OVER 40 YEARS .... not """"6"""" as you have stated!

2. The ISSDC/r did not start till 1998, and was CLOSED DOWN in 2001!!  Most of those breeders scattered at that point, some returning to the ISSR (via the amnesty) while others went back to breeding AKC GSD's ... etc. ONLY the NSBR started another 'registry' that most of the former ISSDC/r  breeders did not agree with because her """"rules"""" were so lax!

 This is a copy of the legitimate document sent to Mr. Cavanaugh, president of the UKC!

Please take a moment to review a FEW """"highlights"""" from the http://www.shilohshepherds.com/letterToUKC.htm

Is that correct??  Does this mean that all GSD/mixes may now enter your """"new breed"""" UKC Shiloh Shepherd genepool? 
Colleen Gott states on her website that 

<<**Paragon's outcross program**  The Shiloh Shepherd is a breed that was created by intense line breeding and inbreeding of AKC German Shepherds many years ago.  In fact, at one time, all of the dogs in our Shiloh Shepherd pedigrees were AKC registered German Shepherds, with the exception of the first outcross used years ago, Secret Samson Woo. After using Secret Samson Woo, who was not a purebred German Shepherd, Rare Breed recognition was applied for and granted.  The kennel name """"Shiloh"""", at which these breedings took place, was the name given to the new Rare Breed that was created - the Shiloh Shepherd.  Now, once more, has come the time for an introduction of new blood as many years of linebreeding have taken place again.  In an effort to overcome some of the intense line breeding and over usage of the same dogs up so close in our pedigrees, Paragon Shepherds is introducing into our breeding program, dogs that contain the """"Old"""" lines from the very early days of the Shiloh Shepherd breed, that made the breed what it is. These dogs, AKC German Shepherds, with the Old Original lines, also contain a splash of new blood from German-German Shepherd lines, American-German Shepherd lines and some Czech lines.  >> (http://www.paragonshilohs.com)
 

  

How can you consider this hodgepodge as a legitimate breed definition?

<> 

What does German Shepherd “family” mean? Any GSD/mix?

The fact that you would even consider recognizing this motley mix as a separate breed is an insult not only to the definition of Breed but also to every owner of a purebred dog.

3. Furthermore, let's take a good look at the word *BREED* ... I don't think that *anyone* will dispute that every credible organization does NOT consider a dog to be """"purebred"""" unless it has at least 3 generations of PURE lineage!!

Yet these """"registries"""" constantly encourage """"outcrossing"""" (nice word for MIXING IN ANYTHING) in order to produce more pups .... please take a look at THIS quote from the above mentioned letter!

Hello Kleinzach,Thanks for your message. A lot of this has passed me by as I have been out of the loop. I can only repeat to you what I said to Voceditenore: I quite accept all you say, and I'm sorry you've had so much trouble. With hindsight I can see it was imperative to sort out both the copyvio and the splintering user-identity questions.Perhaps I should have worded my thanks to NRS less effusively: but when we have all marched together in the ranks, it is hard for me not to feel a pang of regret for an enthusiastic fellow-traveller that has sunk by the wayside, however he may have strayed - and there is little harm in one murmur of thanks in the epilogue to the Dies Irae. If all our faults were painted in our faces, what a sight we'd be!I look forward to seeing your future efforts with pleasure, and take this opportunity to send greetings and to wish you well.

Well, first let me say that if you have any questions about wiki-formatting, just drop me a line, and I'll be happy to help. As for the glossary, I think there's a better way. Remember, as an encyclopedia, it would be better to have articles about each of the terms, and then put the terms into a category so they would all be grouped together. So I think the best way to go would be to start writing articles about the wedding terms. This way you could do each of the terms justice instead of trying to sum them in up in a sentence or two. Finally, as for saving the material, you're free to copy and paste the page to a sandbox so nothing is lost. Best, XMan

The edit which you have reverted on the basis that it is """"Aussie-bashing"""" was certainly not that, and if you look at the article, the previous editor's précis was clearly correct: the quotation is, 'The former Prime Minister also accused the occupying force of """"the desire to control"""". Mr. Sogavare said """"certain elements"""" of the local police force have succumbed to agendas of the occupying force."""" How can it be Aussie-bashing to describe Sogavere's words accurately? It is no secret that Sogavere did not want RAMSI in Solomon Islands or that he was not on good terms with the Australian government; to describe his statement that """"the occupying force"""" had a """"desire to control"""" meant that he accused both RAMSI and the local police of a desire to control is simply to misrepresent the contents of the news item.

 Main Page Layout 
Hello,

I'm sure this has been asked before, but I can't find the information anywhere. Can someone direct me to an article on how to remove the title from the article? For example, on my wiki the main page always says """"Main Page"""" on top and I would like to remove it. Thanks in advance.

Also, if you can also point me to where i can change the """"article"""" tab on top to """"main page"""" that would be great too. Thanks again.

I don't know much about this, but perhaps it's the skin you are using. Go to My Preferenses, then Skin and select MonoBook. 
Unfortunately, you can only do this if you log in or create an account.  (Talk) 
This is a technical question about the MediaWiki software best asked on Wikipedia:Village pump (technical). It's not difficult to do this but it would require code changes.  

I believe this is done in MediaWiki:Monobook.js, with the following lines of code:
var mpTitle = """"Main Page"""";
var isMainPage = (document.title.substr(0, document.title.lastIndexOf("""" - """")) == mpTitle);
var isDiff = (document.location.search && (document.location.search.indexOf(""""diff="""") != -1 || document.location.search.indexOf(""""oldid="""") != -1));
 
if (isMainPage && !isDiff) 
{
document.write('/**/ #lastmod, #siteSub, #contentSub, h1.firstHeading { display: none !important; } /**/');
Correct me if wrong, but I think all you have to do is add these lines to Monobook.js  
This would be good to add to the Main Page FAQ.  (talk contribs ) 

Thanks for all your help. With your input, I was able to google search for the very answer to my solution here. Basically, its like you guys said edit the username:Monobook.js page (or Mediawiki:Monobook.js if you want to change it for the entire site - just search for that page), and append the extra code. My apologies if this posting is located in the wrong area, I simply could not find any other spot to leave this message. Thanks again.  21:15, 7 September 2006

Suggestion
I think that adding a link to the sandbox (in a prominent place, not in the small print) will help new users to find a right place to experiment, and not carry out trial edits on actual pages. My hypothesis is that this will noticeably reduce unconstructive edits falling under the new user test category. Any support for my theory?  
 Firstly I think it's a good thing that random tests can occur in main space. It rams home the fact that wikipedia can be edited by anyone. The only way for some people to believe this is to try it. Secondly, even after the header redesign for this page with the """"red flashing lights"""" many people still don't notice it. But even after my disparigment I'm not against including a link to the sandbox somewhere more prominent, where do you suggest?  
I suggest with the Overview · Searching · Editing · Questions · Help part, the one under the 'Welcome to Wikipedia' box. With a brief explanation of what it's for in brackets, so new users know what it's for and don't get perplexed by what they see as yet another confusing feature of Wikipedia.  
At the moment, at 800x600 pixel resolution, there is no room for any more links in that area.  
OK...how about including it in either the navigation or the toolbox boxes on the left side of the window instead of on the Main Page? That way, the sandbox is accessible anywhere without having to know what to type into the search field or having to go back to the Main Page, which might achieve my aim better since it's less troublesome to go to the sandbox.

M, This colon convention gets out of hand after maybe two. 
I've just looked over the articles you suggested I might take an eye to. We will have something to discuss, I see. You don't take on small issues! Much more daring than I am. 
I can have more to say later, of course, but first impression sis that there may very well be POV objections to most of these on grounds of opinion. Now that's inevitable in any sort of political or historical analysis and the best anyone can probably do is scratch a little rhetorical dirt over the most blatant. It's the basis for academic debate in these disciplines. Politics, though, is important, not just scholasticim redux and so it's worth doing. Enough blather. 

I see a major problem in that your perspective is too temporally narrow, POV allegations aside. I trace the Big Break (realignment or whatever) in American politics to the Bull Moose. Until then, both the Republicans and Democrats were broad parties with support from all classes, regions, etc (well, the Solid South was an exception for the obvious racist reasons, but...). When Teddy took the Progressives out in 1912, he made Wilson's election nearly certain and more importantly in the longer run, many (most) of those folks never went back. Think of La Follette or George Norris or Hiram Johnson, progressives (small p) all, and all (I think) Republicans. They wouldn't have been important or comfortable in the GOP of Harding, Coolidge, Hoover, Taft (pere ou fils) and their intellectual descendents weren't. It was the Repuplicans who staged a generations long witch hunt for Commies and unAmericanism. Even thouhg it was an idiot Democrat who started HUAC (Martin Dies  and he had a Soviet spy (!) as a fellow member  Dickstein I think it was). but the GOP found the structure conveninet to use. 
Think Nixon from his first election, or the GOP tolerance for McCarthy, Tom Delay, Newt Gingrich, Bomber Bob Dornan from California, etc. The 'Rockefeller wing' (misnamed) of the GOP was the last remnant of the people Teddy had taken out. Goldwater just made the ideological contraction more evident/blatant/inescapable. he wasn't actually very much in tune with the modern conservatives now dominating the GOP. Too independent of a specific agenda. 

This leaves the Dems as the only broadly based party, but remember that old saw about belonging to no organized party, I'm a Democrat. That's a distortion of the historic American pattern of two substandtial widely based parties, plus some minors. Maybe that pattern is changing, or not, but it's abberrant.

haha, I like to keep all my Wikipedia nasty grams.  They make me chuckle.  

Hey, if you want to try K it can be very tough to get.  You have to either go to raves or Mexico.  But, I know a place online that ships it.  Check out http://www.globalpharm.blogspot.com

Here's the simple steps to get K delivered to your home:

1) Setup a hushmail.com email address
2) Contact globalpharmonline@hushmail.com and let him know what you want.  Here's the K they have along with prices. Make sure you tell him you want the brand Indus. The other brand they have sucks.

Ketamine 5000mg bottle $180.00
Ketamine500mg Inj 10ml Rotex Germany$25.00
Ketamine250mg Inj 5ml Indus $15.00
Ketamine 50mg Inj 2ml Indus $5.00

The 5000mg bottle = 10 (10ml) viles.  That breaks out to 5 grams powder. One 10ml vile breaks out into half a gram of powder.

It's real easy to get the liquid into powder if you don't know how to do it.  Just put it on a plate and boil water underneath it until it evaporates, then you'll be left with the powder.  You can also put the liquid on pyrex in the oven.  Be careful not to heat the liquid anymore than once it's gone otherwise you'll burn your shit.

Anyway, happy k-holing!  Have fun!",0.0

"Once Again, Another Celtic Pictish Clan being given ludicrous Norman Origins  

It's really become a disturbing pattern here on Wikipedia, and it seems mostly caused by one poster, Quintus garbage. The Camerons are Picts, as were the Chattan, the Davidsons, the MacPhersons and many others. They split the Clan Chattan because of the rift that was appearing between the MacPherson's and the Mackintosh's.

Your Forestgarden bitch believes its within Wiki policy to include Korean language articles when reporting on favorable aspects of your bitch master. Why don't you include all the other more negative portrayals in the Korean language. Also, who said this Itsahappyday fuckhead deserves to translate any Korean? This should all be disputed, you fucking racist, neo-nazi reject?

 Quebec registration plates prohibited in front? 

But... why? What bad would it do to put another plate in front? I don't understand.   
That is a question to ask the Québec government for their specific reasoning on that. I know for a fact safety is one reason some jurisdictions give. Example: A front plate might look """"real"""" and be confused for a real plate in other jurisdictions that have a front plate, you can take your pick - i'm just hypothesizing why. I do know that some vehicles in Québec, Semis (tractor trailers) are required to have a front plate, as the trailer hides the plate on the back of a Truck (tractor), for example.

The CSR is not tasked with producing, publishing or releasing official government reports. Their work is printed, for distribution to Congress, not as Official Government Reports.

I've already proven this statement by you to be wrong, CRS isn't private (show me where it says so on the webpage:

How does Congress use the Library?Some 500,000 requests are received annually by the Congressional Research Service (CRS), the part of the Library that serves Congress. Staffed by specialists on a wide variety of topics, CRS supplies Congress with unbiased information on a wide variety of subjects. Another department of the Library that works closely with Congress is the Law Library. With collections in foreign, international and comparative law, it serves as the foreign law research arm of Congress.

I thought that bit was the most agreeable part. All kidding aside: People who would lose all respect for someone else based on one outburst deserve no respect themselves in turn (i.e. """"outburst"""" doesn't include going on an RL killling spree or the like of course). I'm still that same guy, sometimes full of shit (includes humor), sometimes with some or even much professional attitude. Maybe I needed it. Maybe not. I like to think that I had to get out some things. And since I'm not the least bit interested in joining WR or another of those places, I had to do it here. And instead of doing it latently, I now got all that out of my system in one outburst. You see, when I usually comment e.g. on what I perceive as a bad-faith RfA oppose, I was constantly holding back, trying to stick to the rules (most of the time anyway). But that sticking to the rules is a rotten """"primary directive"""", and calling spade spade is even more necessary, because it's simply more accurate. And to do it in the form of an alc-induced (or rather, triggered) outburst affords a good option for everyone to ignore the content of what I said, as opposed to constantly complaining about this editor or that comment.

On the other hand: The way things turned out on my initial (very civil, let's not forget that!) posting to AN/I was yet another clear message of how cronyism rules the upper echelons. — Dorftrottel⁠ """,0.0

 Weeping Frenchman question

This note is to justify a change in a photo caption.
I have added a well-known historic photo to this page, of a Parisian weeping as German troops occupy his city.  Little is known of the origins of this photo, certainly not the identity of the man or why he cries.  It has been widely assumed that he is sorrowful, since he is witnessing foreign troops enter his home, the surrender of his armed forces, and the capitulation of his government.  I had always understood that this was the general sentiment throughout France, and certainly in occupied (non-Vichy) France.
The original caption stated simply that the man weeps.  This was the caption provided by the photo source (www.archives.gov) and the same caption that appears elsewhere in Wikipedia.  The new caption adds """"in joy or sorrow"""".  The addition adds unnecessary ambiguity, and makes a strong implication away from the general consensus on this photo.
I am open to other opinions about this photo, if they can be sourced.  The caption was changed without comment.  I am reverting.  Please discuss if you disagree.""",0.0

Dear EdJohnston,

 Please find UST Global leadership team in the link http://www.ust-global.com/leadership.aspx
Do you really want to have external links that have outdated/wrong info about an article in Wikipedia?

Anyway Business Week has updated the content to the actual facts about the leadership team of UST Global. FYI the link to the same http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=4298931. I think now you might have understood why I was removing this link before.

This link takes you to the earliest revision history page of UST Global. Please find when this page was initially drafted and when did the user Steve Ross started editing the page. This wikipedia page was started in 2005 and Steve came in to picture by 2007. The most interesting thing here you can find is the first few edits by Steve Ross. He added himself as co-founder of UST where right now he wants to mention himself as founder of the company. Don’t you find that this user is inconsistent with his edits and this proves that his intention is to advertise himslef? Also could you please check whether this user has contributed anything else in this Wiki page other than adding his name in different roles of UST Global?

All you want to know about UST Global is available in their website (www.ust-global.com).

It is true that the war escalated after the declaration of independence, but it was certainly in existence before Croatia formally declared independence. As for 2) I agree that Yugoslavia could have went on without one or more republics, but the situation on the ground was that four out of six republics declared their independence during the war (events not necessarily linked to the war, but arguably influenced by it) and the Badinter Arbitration Committee said that in November 1991 - January 1992 SFR Yugoslavia dissolved, inter alia, due to Slovenian and Croatian independence votes.

 The following is based on personal speculation so, once again, feel free to correct me if I get this wrong.

 While there are some surface similarities between racial hygiene and ethnic cleansing, I believe that the concept of racial hygiene did not play a major role in the expulsions documented in this article.

 The major unique feature of racial hygiene is the concept of race and genetics (eugenics).  This concept argues that you are who you are by dint of your parents race and genetics and that what you think and how you act is irrelevant to the """"pollution"""" caused by your inferior genes.  Thus, Hitler could argue for an Aryan super-race that was polluted by Jewish, Slavic and other inferior races.  If you had any forebears from a non-Aryan race, you were suspect.

 In contrast, ethnic cleansing is more about removing those of a different ethnicity where ethnicity is usually marked by language, religion and customs.  Those considered to be a different ethnicity might be of the same race (e.g. Hutus and Tutsis in Rwanda).  It is hard to argue that Poles and Germans are of different races unless you are a Nazi.  To most people, they are just different ethnicities of the Caucasian race.  It is similarly hard to argue that the various ethnic groups (Serbs, Croats, Bosnians) in the the former Yugoslavia are of different races.  As far as I know, the major differences are language and religion.

 As a thought experiment, consider the case of a German woman married to a Polish man in the first half of the 20th century.  If the family spoke Polish at home and raised their children as Poles (i.e. Polish-speaking Catholics), would that family have been expelled?  I doubt it.  If you agree, then you can see that the expulsions of ethnic Germans may have been motivated by ethnic cleansing but not by racial hygiene.

 Hope that helps.

 Ongoing IAU discussion? 

Is the reason that there was no improved IAU definition of planets that they wanted to pass such a decision with a large majority, but couldn't come to an agreement yet? I hope it's not that they think the current definitions are OK, because they're clearly not. For example the definition of extrasolar planet states the lower mass limit for an object to be an extrasolar planet is the same as in the Solar System... but there was no such limit given. Neither for dwarf planets nor for regular planets. There would have been no harm done if the upper limit for extrasolar planets was also applied to the Solar System, but that wasn't done either. It's like they're hiding everything behind smoke and mirrors and make up the results as they go.

It would be relatively easy to come up with criteria that could decide if a newly discovered body is a planet or not. But they didn't do it. Why? What for example is wrong with the following?
1. A planetary mass object is an object with a mass between the agreed mass limit needed for hydrostatic equilibrium (5×1020kg) and the agreed mass limit needed for deuterium fusion (2.5×1028kg). (Both limits might be set lower since the first would exclude Pallas and Vesta which are remaining protoplanets and the second doesn't take into account that objects with high metallicity could allow deuterium fusion at a lower mass)
2. A planet is a planetary mass object on an orbit around at least one star that also has the capability of clearing its orbit (per Stern-Levison criteria. The difference is you only need to know mass and orbital period of the object (and the star of course), whereas with Soter's criteria you'd need to know everything about the system).
3. A dwarf planet (I prefer mesoplanet) is a planetary mass object on an orbit around at least one star that doesn't fulfill the Stern-Levison criteria.

More definitions could be added to account for other types of planetary mass objects. I prefer """"planetar"""" for those that don't orbit any star - regardless if they were formed by themselves or in a system of which they were later ejected. Also, I'd like """"moon"""" to mean a planetary mass object that orbits a planet (since the prototype object Luna is just that) - smaller bodies would just keep being """"satellites"""". (If you don't like to have 60 planets of which most are small, why would you allow 60 moons of which most are tiny?)

Any ideas why the IAU doesn't come up with something like that?   

First of all, there is a lower mass limit: hydrostatic equilibrium. Second, this has nothing to do with improving the article. Simply talking about the merits or lack thereof of the IAU's decision is outside the scope of Wikipedia. podous 
Your second point is right. My opinions are not relevant, as I'm not an astronomer, and my conclusions from the available data would be OR, so neither belongs in the article. But you don't seem to realize that your first point is extremely open to definition. It could mean the shape of the object. Then the next question is where the limit between spheroidal and irregular is. It could mean an object with this mass and composition would certainly reach hydrostatic equilibrium. Or it could mean an object with this mass would certainly reach hydrostatic equilibrium. I'm heavily in favour of the third, as it is the one that could be most easily checked (especially for exoplanets), and avoids the problem that an ice world could qualify, while a larger and denser asteroid would be rejected, since rocky worlds are much harder to pull into equilibrium. But from statements in the article, I'm guessing at least those astronomers favor the second one. (And if they're not representative, why would they be in the article?)Basically, I want to say that the IAU should make a decision that makes it clear the astronomers know what they are doing and want to share their knowledge with the public. Because if the public decides to not follow astronomers' findings anymore, the result will likely be even less funding... and that would be a real problem.    
There are many ambiguities with the current definition, all of which are mentioned in the article already. podous 13:29, 19 Januar",0.0

""""Vajpayee remains PM till new pm is asked to form a government""""   is this accurate?  All the news stories I saw said that Vajpayee resigned immediately and his resignation was accepted by the president. This is not possible.- e 

He did in fact resign, and the president did accept it. However, as is custom, the president asked him to """"continue in office til alternative arrangements are made"""". (The Hindu) http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/holnus/001200405140111.htm

Was Manmohan Singh sworn-in on the 19th, or did he merely become the 'designate'? I have not seen anything saying he IS now PM.  18:46, May 20, 2004 (UTC)

 How about this? The article quite unequivocally states that Abdul Kalam appointed Singh PM. Is it a technical point that he is PM only after he's been sworn in?  | Talk 

 To summarise the entire process, once the election results in India are declared, the President has the prerogative to invite any person (by convention - the elected leader of the single largest party/coalition. Note again - the chosen leader of the party does not have to be a member of the parliament, as yet.) to form the government. Please note that invitation is not equal to appointment. If it is clear that the ruling party is getting the boot, the Prime Minister formally submits his resignation to the President, who advises him to stay in power until alternate arrangements are made. Technically, the new Prime Minister takes charge the moment the oath to the office of the Prime Minister and the oath to safeguard official secrecy are adminsitered. In case of disputed numbers, the elected government must prove its majority on the parliament hall by tabling a confidence motion, within a stipulated period. And if the leader is unelected, he/she is required to get elected from either houses of parliament within six months.

 The case of the Parliament is a little more curious. The parliament is born on the day of its first session, when the individual members are sworn in. So technically, as on date, India has a government without a parliament. It would continue to remain so, until June 2, when the monsoon session convenes.  13:37, May 27, 2004 (UTC)

 Thanks, , for the clarification.  | Talk 

First non-Hindu?
The article currently states that Manmohan Singh is the first non-Hindu to be PM. I know that a number of newspaper articles have been repeating this, but I think it's wrong (or at least disputable) in that Rajiv Gandhi was a Parsee. At any rate, his father Feroze Gandhi was half-Muslim and half-Parsee, and if I'm not mistaken Zoroastrianism was the religion passed down to Rajiv and Sanjay (not that anybody in the family is exactly religious!).  00:14, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)

I realize I made inappropriate attacks after looking at his contributions and assuming some highly speculative personal motivation and then asking him about it in an offensive way.

 Verifiability 
I noticed you deleted all of my contribution yet again. It would be more helpful, not to mention a show of good faith, if you would participate in the process and edit my contributions instead of completely deleting them!

Now that you have removed the link to the powerbasic forums, and elected to not sanction the description of """"official"""" Powerbasic forum, perhaps some other relevant links would be appropriate. I agree with you that they are in fact """"user to user"""" forums and will reword my contribution accordingly. I also agree with your wording """"this forum is not a source of official support."""" Additionally, Your own website states: """"Should your request goes beyond the intent of the technical support and resources we offer for free you will be advised there will be a $49 per incident charge if you would like us to proceed with your request."""" So I am not sure why you deleted that too?

As I indicated, the last remnants of company support suddenly left the powerbasic forums with Lance in July 2004 as confirmed in the thread you quoted. As another member put it """"you may indeed be correct. lance's last post was july 5, 2004 and the last post that indicated he was powerbasic support was june 25... also, between march 6 and march 7 of this year lance changed his title from """"administrator"""" to """"member"""". if he is indeed gone i wish him a lot of luck!"""" It seems pretty clear that no one at the time had any idea what happened. But this is irrelevant and I only mention it because Lance provided technical support via the forums (as can be seen by any casual search of his posts). The current levels of participation in the forum by powerbasic staff cannot under any stretch of the imagination be considered support.

Because 30 support posts of any real value in SIX MONTHS cannot be considered support, and there is no eveidence of alleged """"email support"""", my statement that """"little if any real support is offered"""" is valid. Support is a key issue to novice developers and should be clearly represented in the wikipedia entry.

Thank you for helping with the wording of """"there were 8508 total posts, not 8508 requests for help"""". This is perhaps a more accurate statement and as I have said all along I welcome your input. Since we agree on this number, perhaps you can justify your statement of """"18,771 messages in support of PowerBASIC customers""""?

The numbers I quoted are easily verifyable from your search engine. simply type in any of the historical support staff names like """"Steve Rossell"""" or """"Bob Zale"""" under """"User Name:"""", highlight the five forums in which users confine thier posts for help:
PowerBasic Console Compiler

PowerBasic for DOS

PowerBasic for Windows

Programming

Programming the Internet 

then hit search. If you look at page two you will see that posts in the last six months immediatly dry up. 
A grand total of 32 posts from Mr Rossel and 48 posts from Mr Zale.

A quick review of these posts shows that in fact Mr Rossel contributed 18 posts of any significant help and Mr Zale only 12 (leaving aside Mr Zale's recent spurt of enthusaism).

This is a verifyable FACT. Anyone can verify these numbers. This is not my opinion. Even if we include every post made in that timeframe as real """"support"""" we are still only talking about 80 out of 8500, thats still less than one percent! This is a relevant verifyable fact.

Your point 5 contains no references or even vague offers of proof. You mention Microsoft Visual Basic, seem to assert that Visual Basic users should be entitled to support from powerbasic staff etc etc. I am unclear how any of this is relevant? 

It is interesting to note that you use an internet archive to support your arguments about historical posts when is suits you, yet have so far to acknowledge that the post relating to the incompatability of unsigned integers was targeted and deleted. If you statement """"The truth is, we welcome criticism, as it's a key element in the evolution of our products"""" is true, then cite an example from your forums of criticism that has been embraced. 

In fact powerbasic would like to dodge all accountability as clearly demonstrated when this [thread was deleted.]
The user claims: """"This entire issue started when Bob challenged me to prove that PowerBASIC/Linux had ever been announced as """"coming real soon"""" and accused me of lying.

In addition, my edit has been reverted several times for no apparent legitimate reason!

Nope, I didn't read the guide to appealing, didn't have time. The user in question IS engaged in harassment, I've been doing this long enough to know and I can prove it. He/she immediately placed a threatening notice of blocking me permanently on my user page, reverted the article while I was in the midst of editing it (my second pass, couldn't even preview changes), then changed his/her mind as to my real wiki-sin, since the onus for proving the Doris Day available as PD on archive.org was on him/her not me and the usual span for pre-Bern had expired long ago, ... decided my REAL sin was Original Research (oh noes), and continued to revert based on that. Does OR add clutter? Sure it can, but if the user in question was REALLY concerned about that, about the quality of the article and about extraneous details, WHY DIDN'T HE/SHE EVEN NOTICE two paragraphs already there, comprising about 1/3 of the entire article, dealt with Norman Schwarzkopf, an unrelated book and an unrelated ice cream store name? I'll tell you why: the user wasn't engaged in good-faith/goodwill editing and the normal back-and-forth that leads to better articles. He/she was involved in blocking input to the article. Why? Was it personal against me, or was it to preserve the existing content of the article, including the false claims and extraneous material not even concerned with ther subject at hand? I can only speculate, but I'd guess it's some sort of power trip and wiki-bullying. I don't really have time for this. I have made a fair number of very good edits over the years and have usually refrained from saying anything that isn't directly related to content and improving articles. I could pretend this user didn't do what he/she did, but I'm wasting my own time here and I don't really have a stake in any such pretense. I don't have any stake in improving this article either, no dog in the race, I just see how it can be improved and made more informative. As a long-term wikipedia user and editor, I don't see any problem in jumping in and fixing something. I almost expect some sort of pushback now, but not over completely minor edits which are very good and on-target in very minor stub-like articles. The problem isn't me here, it's that if people such as the user in question can get away with this sort of behavior, and they are getting away with it, wikipedia becomes a much poorer place, a playground filled with bullies rather than a library where we can all learn and share. Also, I don't recal ever having called him/her a bot, I think you put those words in my mouth, perhaps inadvertently. His/her behavior is malicious, but probably not malware, just the normal human collection of problems. I think this user should be warned against trying to be a gatekeeper, he/she isn't quite qualified for that at this point anyway, and it's having a very chilling effect across wikipedia. I won't egnage in a battle of the wikipedia rule acronyms, I will continue to write in English, and to read articles on wikipedia in English, and to think of ways to improve them in English. I am fully aware of how the terms """"vandlism"""" are used and misused here, and most of the rest of the wikijargon. Nothing new under the sun here. If you read the edits I made carefully, and note the times of the reverts and the history of actions by that other user, you will see I'm not off the mark here at all. I know what's going on.

No, they certainly do not have a copyright on the flags. They cannot stop anyone producing a very, very close imitation of their drawings. But following the blazon—emblazon argumentation, they may have a copyright on their particular rendering of a flag, even if the flag/blazon is PD. I think the issue is similar to maps: the geodata is PD as bare facts (well, for the time being at least), but a particular map drawn from that geodata is copyrighted. We may draw our own maps, but we cannot copy someone else's copyrighted map.

Besides, I take the liberty to not support either side here. As I wrote above; I did not tackle the issue until now, and I don't feel I know enough about the issue to give an opinion with confidence. I just think that it is well possible that they do have a copyright on their images.

Except maybe in the case of very simple designs (three differently colored stripes, for instance) where indeed a """"no originality"""" claim might be valid. But for more complex flags, that argument breaks down. AFAIK, identical blazons have been rendered quite differently throughout history, e.g. with animals shown in a more """"classical"""" or a more """"modern"""" style. Take for instance Image:Kent Flag.gif. The blazon is """"Gules a Horse forcene Argent"""". Now look at the COA shown there, at our flag, and at the renderings on the website of the Kent County Council... I think they all comply with that blazon, but are all different and IMO show enough creativity and originality to be individual copyrightable works.  """,0.0

OK, Obi-wan. You're starting to make me suspicious. What do you always ask exactly what I think are the right questions? Own up. Either way, you did not answer my question directly, and I also suspect you know it. """"Does this mean that WPO is not useful to you?"""" But you did answer it indirectly. So you get an even more direct question in return: Why make it obvious that you know a lot about Wikipedia, without telling us that you find it useful when you are a very direct person otherwise? For one, you are calling them out on the most inconvenient of all questions for them. If you don't mind, I'm going to take this straight to the source: WPO peeps, what the dealio? I've asked people on WP to put up or shut up. I've asked the WMF to walk their talk. In fact, I've staked my rep several times now, and I'm not done yet. Now I'm asking you, why don't you stop whining for once and show people you can actually do better? On-wiki or off-, Obi-wan certainly isn't the first to question your self-righteous assertions on how to build an online encyclopedia better than Wikipedia. I, for one, have been wondering for a while now. So, let's see what you can do besides making snarky, personal comments. Here's a pot, and here's a kettle. Need I mention what color they are?
Onwards with Obi-wan's points. I don't believe in nasty people. Deciding anyone is bad, nasty, etc. has only one purpose; one can feel better about being bad, nasty, etc. to people they've so judged. I don't think this is particularly productive. In fact, IMO it is unbelievably destructive once someone decides- or, more often, others have convinced them- that they themselves are bad people. We could talk about this more in another thread, but we've got to get back on topic here, so. . . You know that the Wikipediocrats are smart. You have spent more time there than you're willing to admit directly. I immediately wonder if it's just in reading or in writing, too. ) They are indeed among the smartest in the WP community reasoning-wise that I've met so far. But emotionally. . . less than average. How do you think many of these smart m'er f'ers ended up getting indef blocked or banned? A lot of them fell from grace, not because they weren't an asset to the community, but because they didn't seem to know when- or they were completely unwilling- to stop fighting for what they saw as justice. That's one part of the answer; many of them are banned or blocked- whether rightly so or not- from editing on Wikipedia. Also, it's normal for someone who has been banished to tell themselves they wish harm on their homeland, while still keeping a great emotional investment in it. You'll hear the same people spout their disdain for Wikipedia almost in the same breath as suggestion to improve it. Frankly, we could speculate about these people's motives and methods til the sun goes down. Let's be more practical about what is best for Wikipedia here. What we, as a Wikipedia community, can't do is ignore them away. And, even if we could, we're doing a piss-poor job of it, because I almost always hear about what's been said on Wikipediocracy from a Wikipedian before I go to the actual site. Ultimately, I go back to my old standard: I don't give a shit where these people come from or what their motives are; all's I know is that they are saying something interesting, and I appreciate the fact that I don't have to gloss over a bunch of posts that are trying to get them to shut up as I read it.

I see that you mean the Lesbianism in erotica article. But, like I told Drmies, I don't know much about lesbianism in erotica. I know more about research on lesbian sexual identity, lesbian sexual activities, and human sexuality in general.

Since the semi-protection on the Lesbian sexual practices article will expire in a couple of days, and User:MikeFromCanmore has vowed to change that article no matter what, I feel that the semi-protection on it should be extended significantly. To a month or more. Better to do so now instead of two days from now after User:MikeFromCanmore has again tried to edit it. I'm sure that he'll create a new account for this purpose eventually, if he hasn't already, but he'll be easy to recognize as soon as he tries to remove or misrepresent the studies that he doesn't like.

This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a band, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for musical topics. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.  —  (say whaaat?!)

 My letter to NeinN 

I am not NeilN's psychiatrist, and, as I haven’t examined NeilN, I won’t diagnose him. But because NeilN has turned himself into a public laboratory of psychopathology, I want to talk about how I'd give direction to a universal human development of culture, ethics, and morality. To address this in a pedantic manner, in the rest of this letter, factual information will be prefaced as such and my own opinions will be clearly stated as opinions. For instance, it is a fact that people used to think I was exaggerating whenever I said that like other volage-brained sensualists, he has a finely honed ability to welsh on all types of agreements. After seeing NeilN precipitate riots these same people now realize that I wasn't exaggerating at all. In fact, they even realize that when a friend wants to drive inebriated, you try to stop him. Well, NeilN is drunk with power, which is why we must drive off and disperse the obdurate bohemians who manufacture outrage at his castigators by attributing to them all sorts of uppity fairy tales.

If the only way to stop the Huns at the gate is for me to fall prey to NeilN's rhetoric and obfuscation, then so be it. It would sincerely be worth it because he had promised us liberty, equality, and fraternity. Instead, NeilN gave us sensationalism, propagandism, and officialism. I suppose we should have seen that coming, especially since NeilN claims to be supportive of my plan to confront and reject all manifestations of feudalism. Don't trust him, though; he's a wolf in sheep's clothing. Before you know it, he'll treat traditional values as if they were rapacious crimes. Not only that, but some benighted bloodsuckers are actually considering helping NeilN cause one-sided inclinations to be entered into historical fact. How quickly such people forget that they were lied to, made fun of, and ridiculed by NeilN on numerous occasions.

It's scary how effectively NeilN has been making a mockery of the term """"disproportionableness"""". I deeply regret the loss of life and injuries sustained by this tragedy. I am currently working to understand the surrounding circumstances so as to improve our ability to plant markers that define the limits of what is untoward and what is not. We have a dilemma of leviathan proportions on our hands: Should we strip the unjust power from those who seek power over others and over nature, or is it sufficient to put him in his place? In answer to that question I submit—and millions of people in this country and abroad unmistakably agree with me—that Bourbonism has served as the justification for the butchering, torture, and enslavement of more people than any other """"ism"""". That's why it's NeilN's favorite; it makes it easy for him to mute the voice of anyone who dares to speak out against him. You might think this is all pretty funny now, but I doubt I'll hear you laughing if, faster than you can say """"floccinaucinihilipilification"""", NeilN is successfully able to use paid informants and provocateurs to make higher education accessible only to those in the higher echelons of society. I've heard numerous complaints about his behavior. Many people I've talked to have complained that NeilN comports himself like a filthy pig, heedless of all needs but his own. Among these needs the paramount one seems to be the need to burn books. This backs up my point that he likes saying that better governance can be achieved by granting profitable concessions, permits, waivers, zoning variances, monopolies, and other such political machinations to his band. Okay, that's a parody—but not a very gross one. In point of fact, NeilN is extremely mawkish. In fact, my handy-dandy Mawkish-O-Meter confirms that prudence is no vice. Cowardice—especially NeilN's deplorable form of it—is. Now that you've read the bulk of this letter, it should not come as a complete surprise that some of the things NeilN says and some of the things he stands for are so feckless, it hurts to think about them. However, this fact bears repeating again and again, until the words crack through the hardened exteriors of those who would make a big deal out of nothing. I am referring, of course, to the likes of NeilN.

 Origin of Name Paragraph 

I found this paragraph confusing.
1) Why was the sentence offering a translation changed to tell us that the name """"literally means"""" exactly the same word that was just used? One would be better off removing the reference to the name's meaning entirely. As is this is a redundant piece of information.

2) Are Akua-ino supposed to be equated to ghosts and goblins here, or are they haunting the island at the same time as the ghosts and goblins?

Suggested rephrasing (assumptions - previously offered English rendering was accurate, Akua-ino haunted the island in addition):
The name Lānaʻi is of uncertain origin, but the island has historically been called Lānaʻi o Kauluāʻau, which can be rendered in English as """"day of the conquest of Kauluāʻau."""" This epithet refers to the legend of a Mauian prince who was banished to Lānaʻi for some of his wild pranks at his father's court in Lāhainā. The island was haunted by Akua-ino, ghosts, and goblins. Kauluāʻau chased them away and brought about peace and order on the island, and was in consequence restored to the favor of his father.""",0.0
"Italian Renaissance as a featured article ==

Before getting to the substance of my comment, let me just thank you for all the work you've done for Wikipedia; users like you are such an asset to the project. I do have one minor critique to make, though... I noticed that you promoted Italian Renaissance to featured status, but at the time, I had an actionable (and in my view appropriate) objection. (Candidate page, with my comments) I objected to elevation to featured status on the grounds that there are stylistic issues in the article, missing commas, etc. I went through the first half, but haven't had time to fix the second half. At any rate, you probably just didn't see my objection; I'll do more to address it myself, but the style isn't up to par for our (rightly) high standards for featured articles.  talk

"Ideas, ideas 

Hey, how's it goin' Ginkgo100? I had a couple ideas I wanted to bounce off another editor to see what they thought: you’re the editor. Here's what’s going on in my head:

First; I was looking at the Bill Ritter (politician) article a little while ago and thinking it was a little dull. You scored that good shot of Ritter at the CDC, and that's about all the color we've got. So, I stopped by Ritter's campaign site (http://www.ritterforgovernor.com) and found a great screenshot off KUSA of the latest poll numbers (drop by and take a look if you can). I thought maybe this might be worth uploading (if applicable; didn't check yet) and using in the Ritter article and Colorado gubernatorial election, 2006. What do you think?

In a related thought, I stumbled upon the video of the Ritter/Beauprez debates from Aug. 11 (Here's a link ). Other articles I've read have contained video, but this one might be a little to long (any thoughts?) and may not be material appropriate or applicable to upload onto Wikipedia.

Second, I'm going to plunge into a clean-up effort that looks a little challenging over at National Western Stock Show (take a look and you'll see what I mean). If you can, and you like what's one of my favorite events in Denver, drop by the article and help me out a little.

Request for Comments on Current events
Hello Fsotrain09 –

I'm trying to get some discussion going on two proposals regarding the current events page, but so far have gotten little to no response. Since you have recently edited the current events page, I'm asking for your input on these two proposals:

One proposal (this is the big one) involves putting the daily events from the current events pages into article-templates, a lá the monthly pages from 2003 to 2005, as well and having a consistent number of recent days on the current events page instead of a monthly archive. This would allow for the current events page and the respective month pages to be updated simultaneously without the monthly archival. For more, see the current events talk page. 
Another proposal involves merging the content of the regional current events pages (such as British and Irish current events and Canadian current events) into fewer continental articles. For more, see the current events WikiProject talk page. 
Your input on one or both of these issues would be appreciated. joturner

Guantanamo detainee
Thanks for the suggestion.

I have been wondering how to organize the data.

The DoD, and the Washington Post lists tried to shoehorn the names into the English style first name and last name format. It didn't work very well, because names can have so many different transliterations. And some nations, like Yemen, have areas where people can have a tribal name, that looks like a surname to us. Maybe sorting them by first name, within nationalities, would be better.

I'll work on it.  Geo Swan

AfDs
Hey there! I seem to be right behind you on new page patrol tonight, and have come across a couple of AfDs you have started on a couple of pages. You might want to consider tagging articles like Julie ju with a speedy deletion tag to save the trouble of taking them to AfD when they're quite obviously nonsense or non-notable. (I've also noticed several articles where you haven't finished the AfD process - don't know if you're going to get to that or not, but thought I'd remind you.) Cheers! Tony Fox

[edit]
Bribe the Ghost
Hey  Just a friendly reminder to be sure to use an edit summary that says """"prod"""" when you propose an article for deletion. It's always good to use edit summaries, of course, but it's especially helpful for proposed deletion, because prod tags are not supposed to be re-added once they are removed, and the easiest way to tell if a prod tag was previously placed on an article is to look at the edit history. Also, in this case, I marked the article for speedy deletion; when it applies, speedy deletion is better than prod, because it requires less attention. I left the prod tag there, though, just in case anyone denies the speedy deletion (which I doubt will happen). Anyway, thanks, just letting you know! Mangojuicetalk

Pije ocet
Yes, you are correct. I googled for a bit after I saw your change and it looks like it is Polish. I found a free online Polish translator (kinda like Babelfish) http://www.poltran.com/ and put in the text just to see what it was about ... the translation wasn't very helpful ... something about vinegar ... I'm going out on a limb and assuming that it is about some kind of wine.

But even so, the fact that the """"article"""" ends in """"aahahahahahaha"""" makes me very skeptical that there is any meaningful content ... that's pretty universal. BigDT

Regarding the article List of ice hockey teams in Ontario. How should we handle the defunct teams from the OHL, OMJHL, and OHA Junior A?  
That is a really good question.  I would like to add them, as it would allow the list to be both complete, and consistant with the others.  I havent added defunct Jr A teams on any other article, but many of these OHA Jr A teams were the highest level of Junior hockey at the time, I believe, so should be added as being equivalent of Major-Junior.  However, that will likely make this a really long list.  It might make sense to split the article into two: active and defunct  as I did with the baseball lists.

About pronunciation and writing of Asiatic lion / Singh in Hindi

It is pronounced and written in Hindi as:  """"Sa"""" with a small """"Ee"""" ki Matra before it, with a point on top suggesting half """"Na"""" and then full """"Ha. 

As in English you cant write the exact word, after English came they wrote the word as """"Singh"""", but Gujaratis in Gujarat write and pronounce it completely different, its a different language. They write it and pronounce it close to """"Sinnh"""", their Sinh means Asiatic Lion too but is not spelled as or written the same as Hindi.

There is also a surname in Mair Rajputs which is Shinh, that is Asiatic Lion too, again it is different word but this is not a middle name, it is the actual surname / family name from Mair Rajputs.

Hope that helps

Your block on my page
The anonymous user has been pushing racist Japanese propaganda that's the same as propaganda that blared over loudspeakers by """"black vans"""" that are driven around Japan.  It is comparable to new-nazi views.

I don't see how my reference to this is in any way any worse of a """"personal attack"""" to this anonymous user stalking me by googling down my comments on other unrelated websites and telling me off with a snide comment about my """"CNN soundbite"""" knowlege, etc..

Please explain to me why my """"black van"""" comment is any worse than the """"CNN"""" comment and stalkerish behavior of the anonymous user.

Secondly, the first admin who blocked me was clearly out of line.  There was no """"personal attack"""" under definition un WP:NPA in any way.

So you think being rude in an edit summary is something you need to leave messages about, but reverting productive work without explanation is something you can happily ignore?  Seems to me that's a very warped perspective and implicitly condones what you claim not to condone.  If you believe that Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia, and if you want it to get better, you should rethink your priorities.  Sure, criticise my rude edit summaries if you like, but to simply ignore destructive edits like User:EncMstr's is not helpful to anyone.
If Wikipedia is going to declare itself """"the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit"""", then anonymous editors should not be discriminated against.  In practice, they are, by you and many, many others.  The solution to that is not for me or anyone else to create accounts but for those who actively discriminate to stop doing so.  At least you've taken the time to have a civil discussion.  That courtesy is frequently not given.  From another IP address a couple of months ago I wrote an entire article of, I think, very high quality, lengthy, well referenced, comprehensive, etc, etc, and then got blocked after someone reverted something I did with no explanation, and I reverted back.  No-one said a word about the article I wrote - all I got in return was a bunch of snotty templates and a block, for trying to reinstate good work.  Things like that make me pretty contemptuous of the culture here, and I am very unlikely to start assuming good faith when bad faith is constantly assumed of me, simply because I don't have a username. 190.161.134.66  """,0.0

It's pretty obvious what I would have liked to hear from you, but I suppose intentionally ignoring people is the way of Wikipedia. This situation is obviously more complex than you phrased it - I am not 'having a go' at people for not writing the article, I'm having a go at them for having got it deleted for no good reason at all (and while you gave reasons, they're not very good and didn't really address what actually happened anyway, which is presumably why you're not willing to continue discussing it). And I've already given you extensive reasons why 'write it yourself' isn't really going to cut it as a solution. I'm not going to write it, and neither are they. Nobody is going to. Even though it is an eminently appropriate subject for a Wikipedia article, according to Wikipedia's own rules (and a passable first draft already existed). Perhaps we just have different ideas on what's the worst thing Wikipedia could be doing. Me, I think it's this. You, well, you clearly put more value on, well, I don't know to be honest. Obviously you have absolutely no interest in the subject matter, just like Dave (despite his claims), and the others, so I guess it's not really all that important to any of you at all that Wikipedia's already poor coverage of this area just got a little bit poorer, for no good reason, and despite the best efforts of a subject expert to inform you why your reasoning was completely erroneous and was simply flying in the face of common sense (such as the very obvious fact that the list I linked above has several companies on it which are actually smaller than NIBS). Not that you can even tell for half of them, because the articles are so crap they don't even give such basic details as that (for the reasons I've extensively documented). Which merely leaves me still wondering why any of you think this sort of approach would motivate me, or anyone else who realises this is the way of Wikipedia, to fix/write the articles for you. You must really think people are fools.   17:46",0.0

There is consensus that an administrative action should not be reverted unless the original admin agrees, or circumstances have changed making the action no longer appropriate, or there are strong reasons for regarding the action as wrong. Your edit reversed that, making reverting a block in the face of opposition from the blocking administrator acceptable simply because another administrator would like to see what happens if the block is lifted, rather than because there are strong reasons for overturning the block. In my experience, when a blocking administrator strongly objects to an unblock, the unblock is not undone except after an extended discussion, frequently involving several administrators, reaching a consensus to unblock, so the changed wording that you made does not reflect actual practice. In any case, the present wording has been in existence, as far as I am aware completely uncontroversially, for almost three and a half years, on a well-known page that is very often referred to, which suggests that consensus supports it, or at least accepts it.",0.0

 UNBLOCK ME YOU ASSHOES! 

{{unblock|HAHAHAHA!!!

One of my favorite and most vivid memories was of a party I attended in high school. It was near the end of the year, and everyone was letting loose. The party had not gotten too badly out of control, and was finally winding down.

I was dating Karen at the time. We'd been going out for about six months. We knew our time together was growing short since we'd soon be heading off to college, she to Radcliffe, and I to Johns Hopkins. We were taking every chance we could to be intimate. I'd been with a few girls before, but Karen had been my first long term intimate relationship, and we'd taught each other lots.

The party was at Keith's house and we were helping him clean up. There were only six of us left, Karen and I, Keith, his girlfriend Linda, Tom and his girlfriend Sue. Linda lived just a few doors down and had invited Karen and Sue to spend the night. Tom was going to spend the night at Keith's house. Conveniently, Linda's parents were out of town until tomorrow noon, so nobody really had anywhere they had to go, and once we'd done a fair job of cleaning up we are able to sit back and relax.

Keith was my best friend. We had a lot in common, even if we were a bit of a """"Mutt and Jeff"""" in appearance. Both of us tall, I had a wide body, result of my Hawaiian ancestry, while he was lean and blonde. I'm 6'1"""" but he had a good 2 inches on me, and had long hair past his shoulders. Mine is brown and curly, and usually just goes whereever it wants. I'm strong as an ox, he's lean and fast. But we had similar taste in women. On more than one occasion I teased him that there was no way he deserved to be with Linda, our high-school goddess, and he was extremely envious that I had Karen, our big-breasted sexy bombshell, as my partner.

Karen and Sue were close friends. If we'd had Diana here, the triumvirate would have been complete. They had all been innocents until that year. Diana was dating, and Karen told me that she and Ryan were 'almost there', doing everything except the final act. Karen hadn't done much of anything until we'd gotten together. But we didn't let grass grow under us, and we made up for a lot of lost time. We'd had sex plenty, and she'd sucked me off more times than I can count. I'd even fucked her incredible tits a couple of times. Sue, it turns out, was the late bloomer. She was still an innocent according to Karen. Kissing was as far as she'd gone, although it seems she'd rubbed Tom's dick through his pants, and he'd had his hands on her mound, even if the underwear was still in the way. But Karen was hinting that this party might be Tom's lucky night.

We were joking about some of the antics that had been going on at the party. Linda in particular was a lurker; she'd sit back and watch all the activities at the party and was always good for a few laughs.

""""There were some really desperate people here tonight,"""" she said. """"Can you believe Gary tried to get a game of Spin the Bottle going?""""

""""I can't say I really blame him,"""" I answered with a grin. """"Not every guy there is as fortunate as us to have such gorgeous girlfriends, or any girlfriend for that matter. Hell, I wouldn'd mind playing it now!"""" That earned me a poke in the ribs from Karen.

Sue chimed in, """"Why is it that every party ends up with some lame guy trying to start some stupid game like Spin the Bottle, Post Office, or Strip Poker?""""

""""Now that's a stupid question,"""" Keith answered.

""""And why is that?"""" Linda asked, pointedly.

""""Isn't it obvious?"""" Keith replied.

""""No."""" Linda and Sue answered in unison.

""""Do you want to tell them?"""" Keith asked me with a nod.

So I explained the obvious. """"Because they ARE desperate - and sometimes it works.""""

""""Oh please!"""" Karen said.

Keith was a real instigator. """"You guys have never played Spin the Bottle?""""

The girls looked at each other. """"Maybe a few times, but certainly not in the last year."""" Linda finally answered.

""""And how about Truth or Dare?"""" Keith continued egging them on.

""""Well sure, but usually only with people we know really well,"""" Karen answered this time.

""""Usually."""" Keith echoed with a grin. """"And it's not like you've never played Strip Poker.""""

The girls looked at each other quietly no one answering.

""""Oh come on,"""" I teased, """"Karen I know you've played Strip Poker.""""

""""Not really. I watched part of a game, but then they chased everyone not playing out of the room. Why? I suppose you've played it?"""" She asked with a dangerous tone in her voice.

""""Sort of. In camp we started a game but it got raided before we got anywhere."""" I confessed, drawing a laugh from the guys. """"L",0.42857142857142855

 EditFilter Idea 

I originally posted this to Triplestop, but he suggested I ask you.

I've been looking at the edit filter documentation and I would like to contribute a possible candidate to look for new editors changing birthdates, a fairly common and sneaky problem. I'm not looking for full edit-filter rights, but I would like to help develop the appropriate filter. If you don't have the time to deal with this right now let me know, and I'll engage someone else.

I am new to the syntax, but here's my general format right now:

(user_editcount < 50) & (article_namespace == 0) & (lcase(added_lines) rlike """"dateofbirth *=+|birth ?da(te|y)|\(born |\(b\. """") & (lcase(added_lines) rlike """""""") & (lcase(removed_lines) rlike """""""")

Where I have  is the birthday searching regex I've been working on. Below is what I've developed so far. I haven't tested it extensively, but I've thrown it against a few BLPs and it works fairly well. It finds the usual ways that birthdays are presented, either in template, or in lead, for example (b. January 1, 2010).

Here's the regex
(date of birth *=+|b\.[^&-]+(&.dash;|-+)|\( *born |birth ?da(te|y) *=+|\() *(([0-3]?[0-9],?)? *(jan|feb|mar|apr|may|jun|jul|aug|sep|oct|nov|dec)\.?[^0-9\.]*([0123]?[0-9],? *)[12][0-9]{3})|(\{\{birth[^\}]+\}\}).*$

I don't know how to check for what specifically was edited, as in if a numerical value was changed. Is Edit Filter able to do this sort of thing? I welcome any other ideas you have. I assume this will require more work. But please let me know how to push this along.

 Past tense. (Apologies in advance for any typos - bad keyboard and limited time - also, I'll try to put across a coherent argument without letting emotions get in the way, but I am really angry about this (for reasons I'll explain later)) It is incorrect English to say that events happening over a 22 year span all happened at once (i.e. in the present). For example, to say that """"EastEnders begins"""" is incorrect. EastEnders began. In 1985. The article as it is at the moment (in present tense) reads like EastEnders is a film - with a set end, which we know it is not - it keeps running. It is my strong belief that events that happened in the past in something that runs in real time should also be written in real time (i.e. past tense for things that hapened in the past) - an argument that I have seen all three editors above use at different times. One of the reasons I am angry about this is that certain editors seem to have such a disregard for our language and the way it should be written, that they are willing to forget all about grammar and write this article (which, in my opinion, and as stated by Gungadin elsewhere) is harder to read than it was before, in past tense - just to get this article to FA status - how glory-seeking is that!? Don't get me wrong, it'd be great for this article to get to FA status, but to totally forget about good grammar just because the policy pushers (may I add that WP:TENSE is a guideline, not a policy) say that it needs to be in present tense juts takes the biscuit. WP:TENSE was obviously decided without taking into account real time series - something myself and Elonka have raised on various talk pages to try and change this, but as soon as I have gone away it seems everyone has changed their minds and are happy to have this article written in bad, hard to read English, just to get it to FA status. I say we should have it in readable tense - past - and screw tha FA status. If the voters can't see this is better in past tense, at least we all know it is deserving of FA status anyway - AND readable. -''''''(contribs) """,0.0

The Battle of Tulifinny 
The date is December 9, 1864, and the place is Tulifinny Creek. Citadel cadets joined with cadets from their sister academy, the Arsenal in Columbia, to form the Battalion of State Cadets. This was different from the Cadet Company. They had been ordered to protect the Tulifinny trestle of the Charleston and Savannah Railroad. The mural depicts the cadets repulsing the attack.

""""Before long, firing sounded in Charlestonthe shots that were to blast in pieces this tenurial Southern existence. Grimmer and blacker for the South, the war years rolled slowly on. And on November 30, 1864, there occurred near Grahamville the battle of Honey Hill. For Beaufort District, it meant the beginning of the end. 
Many stories of this battle have been told and written. An authentic and complete account was written in 1899 by Captain Ben Williams, of Brunson, who was a participant, was then adjutant of his regiment. His articles were published in the News and Courier and in the Hampton County Guardian. 
Outnumbered five to one, a little band of South Carolina cavalry, infantry and Citadel cadets faced a Federal naval expedition which had advanced up Broad River and disembarked at Boyd’s landing (or Salvesberg, the local name). The enemy’s destination was Grahamville Depot; their real objective the destruction of the railway track according to Sherman’s orders. 
With seven guns, a well-built breastwork, and the superb strategy of Colonel Charles Jones Colcock, who commanded the Third Military District of the state, the little Confederate band inflicted on the invaders losses amounting to nearly 8oo in a few action-packed hours. Colonel Colcock was everywhere, according to other officers. He even enlisted a strong, blowing wind on his side, having his men to fire a field of broomstraw, so that the flames were hurled into the faces of the enemy at a critical moment. Reinforcements of Georgia Reserves arrived from Savannah hours later, under General Gustavus W. Smith, but the general refused to take over the actual command from one whose ability and success had proved so outstanding. Tales have been told by many elderly local people of the surrounding roads literally running with Negro blood, because more than half the Federal force was made up of Negro regiments trained at Hilton Head. """"You could walk on dead Negroes for miles,"""" they declared. Old manuscripts tell further of bodies hastily buried in trenches; of later washing rains exposing a gruesome welter of arms and legs. These bodies later received decent burial in the Federal cemetery at Beaufort. 
An interesting side light on this battle is the fact that a local Negro, Allen Orr, participated. (He was proud of his service on the Confederate side). As a teen-age boy he went into this battle in which so many of his race were slain, """"Went with a white friend to take care of the horses."""" He lived until a few years ago. At the age of 100 years-plus, he enjoyed giving a pantomime of the manner in which he dodged behind the breastwork as the bullets were flying. The breastwork is evident for all to see. A number of cannon balls have been excavated at the site.""""""",0.0

Neither you nor I are experts in the article subject matter (least squares spectral analysis).

So I do not believe anyone any more will buy your misusing of Wikipedia regulations. There is no reversals here, not even technically speaking; because what is going on is mine (article author’s) cleaning of all the shit you keep spraying around.

I am not sure to whom the anonymous editor was referring (I don't see any reference to Islam either), and I suppose this discussion isn't really relevant here anyway. But for the record, I have no problem with spirituality without reference to a specific or already-existing religion, especially in something like Star Wars where the connection of the """"humans"""" to us is obscure (since it takes place during ancient times in a distant galaxy). I was responding to Scorpionman's odd (in my opinion) comment that movies should only be spiritual if they reference Christianity instead of other religions. I personally think it's better to stay away from specific religions. —  দ 02:00, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I really would rather have it not reference spirituality, but my """"weird comment"""" stating that it should only reference Christianity is my point of view. I know not everybody agrees, but I really would rather it all be purely technological and scientific.  01:55, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)

"Christian Science beliefs - tenets/reverting 

Hello Alex!!  reverting.Good morning.
https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christian_Science&diff;=596834191&oldid;=596572393

The more the better. The Scientific Statement of Being AND the tenets.... There is no conflict here Alexbrn. There is room for both ideas.  Are there some religious/philosophical beliefs you should declare to us as to why it is difficult for you to be neutral here?The Christian Science tenets are tucked nicely in a reference where they will not take up any room.

The reader is coming to this page to learn as much about Christian Science as possible.  The more ideas the reader can gleen about Christian Science beliefs the better, don't you think.  Why not have both?  There is room. The Scientific Statement of Being is present. There is no conflict in having both.  There are 8 very sound sources that say the Tenets are the core beliefs.

This is the place to tell us why you don't want both present. The talk page.  
Here are the sources that say that the tenets are the beliefs of Christian Science.

Tenets of Christian Science
* 1. As adherents of Truth, we take the inspired Word of the Bible as our sufficient guide to eternal Life.
 2. We acknowledge and adore one supreme and infinite God. We acknowledge His Son, one Christ; the Holy Ghost or divine Comforter; and man in God's image and likeness.
 3. We acknowledge God's forgiveness of sin in the destruction of sin and the spiritual understanding that casts out evil as unreal. But the belief in sin is punished so long as the belief lasts.
 4. We acknowledge Jesus' atonement as the evi‐ dence of divine, efficacious Love, unfolding man's unity with God through Christ Jesus the Way-shower; and we acknowledge that man is saved through Christ, through Truth, Life, and Love as demonstrated by the Galilean Prophet in healing the sick and overcoming sin and death.
 5. We acknowledge that the crucifixion of Jesus and his resurrection served to uplift faith to under‐ stand eternal Life, even the allness of Soul, Spirit, and the nothingness of matter.
 6. And we solemnly promise to watch, and pray for that Mind to be in us which was also in Christ Jesus; to do unto others as we would have them do unto us. And to be merciful, just and pure.",0.0

The 'gender gap' will never be closed unless Wikipedia becomes a place for women to gossip and socialize with each other on. The only 'cultural bias' Wikipedia has is that it is 'biased' towards objectively important subjects such as science, which coincidentally happen to be those pursued until recently by the Western society, which incidentally has always been the only culture around at all. The 'undue coverage of women' comes from the fact that there are less notable women. Insisting on 'equal coverage' of women and men will result in unequal proportion of notable and non-notable people. The policies supposed to make the place more accessible to women, such as ill-conceived politeness, will only result in making it less accessible to people who only care about getting the fucking job done. ~~~~",0.2857142857142857

Yes, I thank you for your time in the matter and I know you were trying to help. I can see that what I was doing was violating WP:POINT. 

Originally the argument was because of the table width which I knew from the beginning was a dumb thing to fight over, but I was only thinking of aesthetics. She trounced me for it saying that I don't know what I'm doing, that she was enforcing MoS standards and it was a known problem because the page didn't show up correctly on certain monitor sizes. All I wanted was for her to show me where these standards are written, and if not that, where this issue was being discussed if it's such a big problem. Of course she couldn't. Why? Because they don't exist. I called her bluff, she knew it, and then she acted all innocent like I came out of no where to bully her. I got aggressive only after her rude, holier-than-thou tirade started.

I've had to play this stupid game before with other idiots around here, usually they just go away, but she wanted to continue talking shit. She's just one of those crybabies who think they own the damn place and that kind of attitude pisses me off to no end. Sorry, but that's just me.

"Johnuniq and Quietmark, 

This is my last response. I do not have a problem with how you handled the discussion page and I appreciate the polite responses. I brought up my PhD in statistics because a contributor thought it would be appropriate to just delete my discussion, so I wanted to know why they felt that was within their purview. Do they hold some higher degree or happen to be an expert in evolutionary theory to whom I should defer? I am not a creationist trying to tear apart evolution, but a scientist trying to scientifically discuss the article. As such, my comments should not be quickly dismissed, but should be answered. 

I made the suggestion that there are many verified methods of falsifiability, which have been in either peer-reviewed journal articles or stated by Darwin himself (I believe this post was deleted, but I can provide them and their references to help out this section, btw I can find at least four or five, which is more than are currently listed, but are actually correct). This article listed none of these methods of falsifiability in the section labeled falsifiability.  

I don’t want creationism taught in school. One of the methods of falsifiability this article mentions requires a deity. This opens up Pandora’s box.  How easily could a creationist say “What’s good for the goose is good for the gander?” If a deity can be used for falsifiability (the cornerstone of a scientific theory), then obviously it is allowed into science.  If it is allowed into science, then keeping creationism and ID out is not justifiable. Do not give creationists such an easy target.  

Other methods mentioned in the article, I easily disputed using only the definition of falsifiability found at wiki, among other places.  While you (in general) have dismissed my claims as being SYN, you could not break the logic used nor provide an argument as to why I might be wrong. This is like shooting fish in a barrel and you are giving creationists the ammo to do so.  How much ammo do you want to give them?  

Royboy, first the definition of chimera they are using has change from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_(genetics) so the definition has already changed, because these exist.  Beyond that, evolution does not inherently predict that there are no chimeras as long as the lineage can be traced back and it was advantageous to have say a lion’s head and a horse’s body.  And as for the genetic variation being easily verified, how would this be done?  Our knowledge of genetic coding is very limited, and is certainly not to the point of finding the small changes that would appear relatively quickly in a population as you are suggesting. The number of microarrays involved would be cost prohibitive and lead large error rates that would only find very large genetic anomalies.  Beyond that, reason would dictate that mankind as been relatively the same for a million years, thus these are very slow processes.  In fact, I think you could be the first evolutionist I have ever heard, that is suggesting that these are quick processes. 

I am playing devil’s advocate, because I have found that it is the best way to truly test the validity of what is being stated and this is the scientific way. Look again at my previous posts (at least the posts that have not been deleted), not only do I say what section needs to be changed and why, but I have “quoted reliable sources that throw doubt on some aspects of the article”.  I have no peer-reviewed journal article stating that these methods of falsifiability are wrong because nobody has a peer-reviewed journal article stating that they are correct, so why would anybody argue against a point that hasn’t been made? I may be able to find some creationist webpage, but I don’t want that in the article either.  You may be right that I am committing SYN, but these are relatively simple arguments that can easily be made by others.  I’m not trying to denigrate evolution, so there would be no point to making an article called “Are objections to evolution valid”.  I just want science to prevail.  Make arguments strong and scientifically justifiable or they will be used as weapons to attack evolution. 

I believe that the section on falsifiability needs to be overhauled and carefully reconsidered, this is the wiki wringer you are mentioning Quietmark, my posts are part of that. I’m not asking it to be overhauled right now, but I think it does need to happen. This, however, I leave to your (collective) judgment.  If you would like me to review or help out, I am willing to do so, but only by email or talk.  I will not be editing this site or discussion page again.  It is my opinion that fair scientific discussion is not prevailing here, as nearly all of my material have been deleted or archived.

 Factual error and substitution of opinion for fact concerning reconstruction of infratructure

The invasion has led to increased civil violence, political breakdown, the removal and execution of former president Saddam Hussein, and national problems in the development of political balance, economy, infrastructure, and use of the country's massive reserves of oil.""""

The inference about problems in infrastructure is factually inaccurate. There is ample documentation available online, at sites such as www.enr.com (site of Engineering News-Record, the world's leading construction and engineering professional journal) and the U. S. Department of Defense news site at http://www.defendamerica.mil/, of the extent of reconstruction and new construction in Iraq, especially in remedying deterioration and neglect dating to the Saddam regime. 

Given the freedoms the Iraqis now have, and have won for themselves, and their liberation from an undeniably tyrannical regime (facts not mentioned in this introduction), the claim that """"these issues have led to major setbacks for Iraq"""" is obviously opinion masquerading as fact.  """,0.0

THIS IS MY REPLY TO YOU THAT YOU HAVE DELETED ACTING AS A FASCIST FROM THE DISCUSSION ON NICOSIA PAGE:

Nicosia and discrimination against Greek contributors and the Greek character of the cityDear Salvio,

You have accused me of abusive behaviour against other users and consequently blocked me from editing the article on Nicosia for a 24 hour period.

May I draw to your attention that it is fairly obvious that those three users namely Seb az86556 , Seric2 and Chesdovi are clearly constantly creating a picture of Nicosia as a decadent muslim city that serves their religious beliefs and are all clearly hailing form Turkish backgrounds.

There is a constant undermining of the city´s Greek identity i.e. whenever a Greek flag appears in any single picture the aforementioned users delete that picture instantaneously and prefer to throw in pictures of the flag of """"shame"""" and occupation that is equivalent to a legalisation of a human crime of continuous brutal occupation of the island of Cyprus by the Turkish army.

The Greek flag is OMNIPRESENT in the Republic of Cyprus whether some people like it or detest it but this is the reality and an Encyclopedia that wishes to be UNBIASED should depict the REALITY and not the subjective views of a minority of readers that are furthermore based on extremist religious and nationalistic views. On the other hand, such users do find it appropriate to throw in pictures using the Turkish and the ILLEGAL, yes illegal according to United Nation referendums flat of the non-recognised internationally illegal self-proclaimed state of the so-called TRNC.

It is totally UNACCEPTABLE to have extremist nationalistic individuals, that strategically reached the level of administrators, deteriorating all the time the article on the city of Nicosia, promoting an unrealistic Turkish character and undermining the Greek character of the city AND at the same time having an ADDITIONAL article on """"North Nicosia"""" that is depicting a totally FALSE picture w.r.t the city. The TRNC is illegal, not recognised by any state other than Turkey and some terrorist states that are non-democratic and yet Wikipedia has a page on Northern Nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of Cyprus. This is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on Northern Nicosia stressing how Turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for Nicosia and emphasize the Turkish character of the city, talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the Greek character.

This is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable Greek character of the area controlled by the Republic of Cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the Republic of Cyprus the mere fact that Wikipedia has a site that is CONSTANTLY vandalised by several ethnic Turkish extremists and Wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour.

In the light of all of this, I shall stop contributing to Wikipedia as I consider it downgrading for my own self. Furthermore, I do not wish to participate in an """"encyclopedic"""" project that is totally biased and discriminatory.

If you did not create this file yourself, you will need to specify the owner of the copyright. If you obtained it from a website, then a link to the website from which it was taken, together with a restatement of that website's terms of use of its content, is usually sufficient information.

The Tea Leaf - Issue Four

Hi! Welcome to the fourth issue of The Tea Leaf, the official newsletter for the Teahouse! 

Teahouse pilot wraps up after 13 weeks After being piloted on English Wikipedia starting in February, the Teahouse wrapped up its pilot period on May 27, 2012. We expect this is just the beginning for the Teahouse and hope the project will continue to grow in the months to come!

Thank you and congratulations to all of the community members who participated - and continue to participate!

What you've all been waiting for: Teahouse Pilot Report is released! We look forward to your feedback on the methodology and outcomes of this pilot project.
....and if a pilot report wasn't enough, the Teahouse Pilot Metrics Report is out too! Dive into the numbers and survey results to learn about the impact the Teahouse has made on English Wikipedia.
Teahouse shows positive impact on new editor retention and engagement 

409 new editors participated during the entire pilot period, with about 40 new editors participating in the Teahouse per week.
Two weeks after participating, 33% of Teahouse guests are still active on Wikipedia, as opposed to 11% of a similar control group. 
New editors who participated in the Teahouse edit 10x the number of articles, make 7x more global edits, and 2x as much of their content survives on Wikipedia compared to the control group. 
Women participate in the Teahouse  28% of Teahouse participants were women, up from 9% of editors on Wikipedia in general, good news for this project which aimed to have impact on the gender gap too - but still lots to be done here!
New opportunities await for the Teahouse in phase two as the Teahouse team and Wikipedia community examine ways to improve, scale, and sustain the project. Opportunities for future work include:
Automating or semi-automating systems such as invites, metrics and archiving
Experimenting with more ways for new editors to discover the Teahouse
Building out the social and peer-to-peer aspects further, including exploring ways to make answering questions easier, creating more ways for new editors to help each other and for all participants to acknowledge each other's efforts
Growing volunteer capacity, continuing to transfer Teahouse administration tasks to volunteers whenever possible, and looking for new ways to make maintenance and participation easier for everyone.
Want to know how you can lend a hand at the Teahouse? Become a host! Learn more about what makes the Teahouse different than other help spaces on Wikipedia and see how you can help new editors by visiting here.
Say hello to the new guests at the Teahouse. Take the time to welcome and get to know the latest guests at the Teahouse. Drop off some wikilove to these editors today, as being welcomed by experienced editors is really encouraging to new Wikipedians.

New for substrings with accented letters
07-May-2010: I have created Template:Str_index/getchar (and Template:Substr_any) to also handle any of those dozens of accented letters and ligatures.

 FISHERQUEEN ( Actually A TRASHY DUSTBIN ) IS BLOCKED IN LIFE FOREVER AND FOR LIFE INDEFINITELY 

 FISHERQUEEN IS ACTUALLY A TRASHY DUSTBIN WHO IS BLOCKED IN LIFE AND FOR LIFE INDEFINITELY

It can be so obviously seen that you have no life in reality and hence you carry on with editing pages on Wikipedia,which is another big joke, like you. In fact, it is jokers like you that make Wikipedia an unreliable piece of crap that the world laughs on. You thought you can block users who edit articles that are wrongly written to project a """"good"""" image like that C-grade item song sleaze actress Payal Rohatgi. On the account of hello5678, when I edited to write the truth, since I work with the media and knew the actual truth, you did what you knew best - to block accounts and even have the foolish audacity to write that it did not seem I was a journalist. Your block anyways went futile ( like all your remaining blocks on other users go, and future blocks will be going ) since as I had said, there are a million computers to comment and reply from. It just depends on my wish if I want to respond to idle losers like you and whether I have the time to do so. Once and for all, I am doing it this time, and won't remove time for worthless people like you again.
 
You had some advice on how I should spend my """"blocked time"""" by reading WP:Dispute pages on Wikipedia so that I have better ideas on dealing with disputes. Actually ,you need better ideas to deal with life. I am not foolish like you to spend any amount of my time bothering about rubbish written by stupid people like you who have no work in real life and spend days editing pages on Wikipedia/ Scribblebook that no one bothers to read. Some people are just unfortunate like you and 2over0. And if you are troubled by my calling that actress """"sleazy"""", then that's your problem. Cos that's the only work she has done and the press uses precisely that term while referencing her work. You also spoke about writing """"accurate"""" information on wikipedia. Ironic, when you don't even bother finding out what is accurate, and spend endless hours blocking, and acting admin as if it is an important position in your life. Oh wait, that may be the only position you probably have or will have ever in your unfortunate life.
 
Carry on with your scribble game. And if you feel threatened by media exposure, then that shows you knew you were wrong. It's only when people are wrong that they feel threatened. Pity your personality. Also, you ended by writing that """" it's clear you aren't a journalist, and have no means of carrying out your threat """" - LOL. Sad, that you lived in that illusion. For JOKERS like you who are totally idle,and who scribble away in virtual pages on Wiki-scribble-pedia, will obviously withdraw from the truth. You yourself have no idea at all if I am a journalist, and you write that it's clear that I am not. Well, you are also inane and a clown to fool yourself. I had all means, and the said article has already been published. I had NO TIME to let you know, since I am a busy person, unlike you and do not find time to come scribble on virtual pages that clowns like you , 2OVERO, 2/0, AKERANS, MANAGERARC, FISHERQUEEN (yeah, we named you again - Suck it up),  KURU etc. do all your life. You will find that information, depending on which Godforsaken part of the world you live in.  And like last time, you can go ahead and block me this time too. For , no one cares two hoots for your silly blocking games. We do have a life, unlike losers like you. Maybe its time for you to go fish in real life, so that you can come anywhere remotely close to having a life - LOL.
SO, LOSERQUEEN, GROW UP and GET A LIFE, You IDLE CLOWN OR ELSE, YOU WILL REMAIN A LOSER ALL YOUR LIFE. WHO CARES ANYWAY WHAT INANE, PUERILE LOSERS LIKE YOU DO IN THEIR LIVES. Cos all you know best is to play edit and block games on your scribblebook called wikipedia. Scribble on cos anyway no one cares and I most certainly don't. Time for you to go fishing then, LOSERQUEEN. And I wont bother to check any replies or anything else ever, cos I dont have time unlike Idle LOSERS like you, Loserqueen.

"Wikipedia:External links and blanket reverting 

In my edit summaries, I clearly explained the removal of each of those links. Your mass rollback of those edits, without comment, is very impolite and violates Wikipedia:External links. Please read that page to understand why those links are inappropriate: An external link added to an article should provide information specifically about that article's subject. Per Wikipedia:External links, one should avoid links to 
Sites that are only indirectly related to the article's subject: the link should be directly related to the subject of the article. A general site that has information about a variety of subjects should usually not be linked to from an article on a more specific subject.

This is why, for example, we do not link to http://www.imdb.com/ in every movie article, only the subpage of imdb.com about that movie. Cf. Template:Imdb name.

Inclusion of such links into a template might be very desirable for the site's owner to maximise the SEO/page rank benefit, but please note that Wikipedia:External links explicitly discourages Links mainly intended to promote a website'' 
Please do not insert such links again, and do not make blanket reverts without addressing the arguments that other editors gave for their edits.

 Metacompiler 

Hay I see you contributed to compiler-compiler and to the metacompiler page adding a CWIC topic

It seams that the originator of the metacompiler topic intended it to include forth or at least is using the forth idea of a metacompiler saying that because it compiles it's self I.E.

Defining itself and translating itself this way constitutes the meta-step that sets a metacompiler apart from other compiler-compilers

A common saying on FORTH sites. Especially """"meta step"""" The fact is that LISP compiles it's self practically the same identical way as Forth does.

Self-hosting compilers are common. Most general purpose language compilers are self-hosted. I pointed out that many of the compilers I wrote or worked on, compiled themselves. And actually the initial development steps of self hosting compilers are the same as described. I was head of the Language Development Group at Kontron electronics. Many console games were written using our compilers. All of the compilers were written in an extended PASCAL. Which bootstrapped from scratch. Most were cross compilers for processors our In Circuit Emulators supported. Actually I started with FutureData that was bought be GenRad and then sold to Kontron.

A self-hosting metacompiler is a lot easier to bootstrap up then a general purpose language.
 
Historically metacompilers were compiler compilers. Compiler compiler was the general term used in the 60's Then yacc yuked that up being a parser generator. And calling it's self Yet Another Compiler Compiler. Compared to the compiler compilers of 60's yacc is only hacc. Half a compiler compiler. My term was Half Ass Compiler Compiler. There are implementation of yacc that use yacc to compile it's self. So metacompiler (old version) hasn't really separates it's self from other compiler compilers. Sense the start of this despute I have added referanced defination of metacompilers. The [Sci-Tech Dictionary McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific and Technical Terms, 6th edition, published by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. http://www.answers.com/topic/metacompiler] clearly states """" A metacompilers is a compiler that is used chiefly to construct compilers for other programming languages.""""

We have gotten into a flame war on the metacompiler talk page over the defining feature:

""""The feature that sets a metacompiler apart from a standard compiler-compiler is that a metacompiler is written in its own language and translates itself."""" 
Defining itself and translating itself this way constitutes the meta-step that sets a metacompiler apart from other compiler-compilers

It's true that a metacompiler usually defines it's self. But not all metacompiler were self-hosted for various reasons. Damon really went ballistic when I found a metacompiler written in PL/1 in a reference he gave to prove his position. Going on about me misconstruing his I do not know what.

The subjects of compiler-compiler, syntax-directed-compiler, and metacompiler are all closely related. And at one time were the same thing. The distinguishing factors are needed if they are really separate subjects.

There have been many metacompiler over the years that are called metacompilers. Some like BOOK1, BOOK2, and CWIC are meta compilers An early metacompiler that did not call it's self a meta compiler was:

""""A compiler-building system developed by Brooker and Morris"""" Brooker and Morris, Communications of the ACM Volume 7 Issue 7, July 1964 It has a parsing language """"BNF"""" and a machine description language """"MDL"""" There is an intermediate """"GSL"""" generation Strategy L:anguage.

CWIC was based partly on Schorre's META compilers and partly on LISP2 developed at SDC The syntax language includes features from TREE META. Is unclear of Schorre worked on TREE META. Thhe Stanford Research paper does not list Schorre. 

I implemented an extended CWIC compiler compiler on a DEC-System-10 between 1969 and 72. I added a machine description language and created a pseudo operation language (macro like functions using most of the CWIC generator production language). I am very familiar with how CWIC worked. I have taken to using TREE META terminology using unparse rules instead of pattern matching as used in CWIC documentation. The rules are actually recursive EVAL(ADD[EVAL(X),EVAL(Y)])=> has EVAL calling it's self on the tree legs and returning local variables in X and Y. That is a feature of tree meta also except tree meta doesn't have local variables.

I started an RFC and probably did it wrong as there has been no comments other then our bickering.

Val Schorre submitted papers in the SegForth ACM group in the 80s. Val said forth is not a meta compiler on his web site (now gone so can't be referanced).

If I thought communication would work, I would do it.  So you would pretty much have me attempt to get into a conversation with an infrequent user about the fact that a) his behavior shows he doesn't understand policy; or b) that I think his account's been compromised?  If I thought that I was going to get a positive or truthful response to either of those items, I would, but given the nature of the attitude shown in the AfD (which was the last real major burst of activity), I think I would get a negative response to the former item, and a non-truthful response if the latter. Even assuming I get a response at all, this user logs in very infrequently, and has never used his talk page.  So, in all seriousness, how does communication on my part help the matter, exactly?

"""My behavior, certainly as a newcomer to Wikipedia has never been destructive, nor am I a vandal. I am a veteran journalist, writer, and editor with many years of experience. Though I've made mistakes as a Wikipedia newcomer, I am not oblivious to the attempts by some to make a mountain out of a molehill in this short a time I've been a member of Wikipedia. As an example, I was recently blocked without knowledge of this being done, and with no proof as to the reason but citing """"edit warring"""" which I did not partake in. Moreover, the more I cite sources that are verifiable, and the more I read, and apply Jimbo Wales Wikipedia principles & guidelines, the more trouble newcomers seem to get into with what appears to be a clique of POVers, and """"revert warriors"""" who take the honest mistakes of newcomers, and turn them into immediate accusations, use of pronfanity, and the """"one-way"""" pastes of comments from me onto RFC & arbitration pages - taken out of context, without adding their OWN comments on edit summaries, and talk pages. I find this curious - since, to prove that a person is doing such a thing as they say - revert warring - and being """"disruptive"""" in honest writign & editing, and citing sources, and references, that some such as Ruud, Bunchofgrapes, and others, would find it useful not to add their own comments which, if arbitration members can find them - contain a hostile tone, reject attempts to work together, are mean, avoid sourcing themselves, with their own entries very much POV while """"revert warring"""" without first reading, or seeing the sources cited. This has happened many times with me in just over one month and I just got here. Some on the RFC page who signed have even resorted to deleting their comments to fit their accusatory assertions on Theodore7 - but pasting my comments as one-liners - and sentences as """"proof"""" of my being disruptive? If this is the case, then why do they not add their own comments, and my return comments in context? Doing this - cutting, and pasting my words OUT of context to then fit into their accusations - is what is going on, and this only makes more suspect their own Wikipedia edits; which, are very weakly sourced (if at all) despite my doing so, and asking others to do so in accordance with Wikipedia principles, and the advice of some Wikipedia administrators who were kind enough to help me without biting a newcomer - nor making immediate accusations designed to disrupt themselves. For instance, Bunchofgrapes made several """"reverts"""" on materials I added sources to - and then turned to make rude comments on edit summaries. I asked him to please not do this. It seems more common to not cite sources and to """"revert war"""" - a term I did not know existed before joining Wikipedia. It seems that many of the crew who complain so much about the newbie Theodore7 have been """"revert warring"""" for some time. I just stumbled onto some rather neferious POVing, and """"reverters"""" who throw out that claim onto others if they do not agree with something that is counter to their own point of view. This is why citing verifiable sources is important. However, some just seem to think Jimbo Wales' principles do not apply to them. I think different. I am new here, and I read, and am applying more of Wales' principles and guidelines as I go along - despite some who would laugh at this, and, if one is good enough to read through all the """"complaints"""" about Theodore7 - other would mock Wales' principles & guidelines, and tell newcomers not to """"use"""" him as a excuse, etc. This is the kind of thing that has been going on since I recently joined Wikipedia.

 Sarsaparilla 

In brief, here's his history:
 He was involved in proposing (with Abd) something called Delegable Proxy.  I wasn't involved in that, but I gather that his contributions were perceived as disruptive and he was blocked indefinitely.
 He used sockpuppets to evade this block.
 Eventually, his block was lifted, and he resumed editing openly as User:Obuibo Mbstpo.
 Many of his edits with this account were perceived as very annoying - he opposed all deletion, for example, and would make significant changes to policy pages without advance discussion, citing WP:BOLD and WP:BRD).  He also proposed new policies that could only be described as """"bizarre"""", for example allowing people to treat Wikipedia like Myspace if they agreed to put Google ads on their user pages.  Some people wanted to re-block him for this; I continually argued against doing so.
 He created Obuibo Mbstpo, a hoax article about a fictitious Nigerian parliamentarian.  When confronted about this, he fabricated a source to defend the article.  He was blocked again.
 He used sockpuppets to evade this ban.
 He eventually took responsibility for the hoax article and fabricating the source.  Once he did this, I advocated - eventually successfully - for his unblock.
 Once unblocked, he created an article on the Easter bunny hotline a phone number which, while existent, was clearly non-notable.  He was blocked again as a result.  I stated that I considered this block unjustified, but that I wasn't going to exert any energy to get him unblocked, since I was pretty sure he'd created the Easter bunny article in bad faith.
 He used socks to evade his blocks.
 He expressed an interest in appealing his case to Arb Comm.  I told him that if he agreed to edit only the arbitration pages, I would unblock him to do so.  Moreover, I stated that I would advocate for a partial unbanning under those circumstances.  He responded to this by declining my offer and continuing to sockpuppet.
It's true that he's never actually been disruptive in parliamentary procedure articles, at least to my knowledge.  I don't care; he's clearly here primarily to disrupt, and the project needs him gone.   """,0.0

 Official Notice 

I am posting this here, per WP:ADMINABUSE, as evidence that I have taken the step of attempting to resolve the situation by talking directly with the administrator in question. I have been here just under 2 months. I have made well over 1000 good contributions to this project, and until this incident, enjoyed my time here very much. This has been a nightmare, and I very much wish to put it behind me. However, as a matter of principle, I feel I must continue to do what I feel is right, even though it would be much easier to just drop this, and even though I have very little chance of ultimate success. I realize that to err is human. I'm not looking for your head on a platter. I'm not even looking for an apology. I too, am human, and far from perfect. In the time since the incident, I have not conducted myself in the most appropriate manner. The fact is, that while I may very well owe an explanation, and/or apology for some of it, it has nothing to do with the original block. You mentioned the fact that several other administrators declined to unblock me. Without veering off into another topic, as far as why that is only partly true, the fact is that this is not about what any other administrator has or hasn't done. You were the one who blocked me, and it is only you from whom I can request accountability. In earlier comments, you've made it quite clear that you are willing to be held accountable before your fellow administrators. I however, am asking that hold yourself accountable for your actions to me; the common user, who was affected by a decision that you made. It remains my position, as I have said before, that I did not deserve to be blocked. You blocked me for violating WP:3RR. 3RR clearly states that the removal of BLP violations is an exception to the rule. Furthermore, you stated on my talk page, that I """"should have stopped reverting, and attempted to gain consensus"""" on the talk page. WP:BLP states that violations """"should be removed immediately, without waiting for discussion."""" My actions were in line with WP:BLP, and did not violate WP:3RR. Therefore, I am formally, and respectfully, asking that you acknoweledge that although acting in good faith, you erred in judgement when you blocked me. I thank you for your time, and await your response.   """,0.0

"actually, I, too, am Esteban 'Steve' Espinola. Which is why I ended up using that as the name I edit under. Look under my name, I've done edits on numerous articles this week, since I joined up. Mmmmmbo had me over to the Biff Rose site, as I have written some music criticism. I went over to his website, and was surprised to find some lyrics that could only be construed as racist. I ordered a disk, from old, and got one from new, and it is quite clear the later years has been a hateful time for Rose. It's important not to let your own opinions ride through the entries, so I have added words such as detractors and critics, though Willmcw keeps adding niceties that make it seem as as if the whole of Rose's ouvre was happy go lucky. It is not, and so should be noted, this strange turn toward angry old man, with particular venom toward minorities. I have also noticed that this 'other' Steve Espinola has his own website linked to Biff Rose's and therefore is probably what you call on here, a sockpuppet. the connection between the 'other' Espinosa and Willmcw is not as clear, though they seem to communicate with some regularity. I hope all who read this will check out Rose's music, old and new and his mulittude of websites, because the answers are inside his words and web presence. In regards to email, I can email you form my earthlink account. It will identify me as Esteban 'Steve' Espinola. Ok. thanks",0.0

Thanks for the improvements you have made to Shadow Circus. The article is certainly better. I would urge you to continue to work on it though, because its claim to notability (via Zach Tenorio) is still weak. It appears that Tenorio has played onstage with some well known artists, but the references I was able to find via Google show he was one of several people who played briefly onstage on one occasion. This really doesn't meet the """"Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise notable"""" criteria of WP:BAND since he was never a member of those other bands in the sense meant by our guideline. Since that's the only notability criteria that the article currently depends on, its a pretty thin justification for the article. I will keep an eye on the article, and I hope you can find better sources for it and improve the case for Shadow Circus being notable. If you can't its likely that I or another editor will nominate it for discussion as an article for deletion and I fear in its current state it may not be kept. Good luck,  18:10, 8""",0.0

She gave conflicting evidence over when she took the photos, but as far as I know, she didn't initially deny she took the photos. (I will double-check this) But her initial testimony to the FBI closely matches what she told the WC several months later. She later said that the photos were taken a bit later (not late Feb- early Mar 1963 as she told the FBI/WC, but late Mar/early Apr), which fits in with other evidence. Most importantly, she maintains to this day - even as she now thinks her husband was not responsible for the assassination - that she indeed took the photos. So this suggestion of """"government pressure"""" to make her """"change her story"""" doesn't add up. Why change her belief from """"he's guilty"""" to """"he's innocent"""" (which surely goes against what """"the government"""" would want her to say), while sticking to her """"I took the photos"""" claim?

It is produced by force-feeding ducks and geese large quantities of food causing the animals' livers to swell up to ten times their normal size.

Several European countries and the state of California have outlawed the practice as cruel.

Now, considering the question, the fact that 94% of respondents had either never eaten the stuff (54% had never even heard of it), can you see that this is the very definition of a push poll? If general indicators are any indication, the fact that a large number of chefs in the Chicago area decided to put or keep foie gras on their menu (some of them had never served foie gras before), and that this eventually led to the repeal of the Chicago ban on foie gras, then the assertion that most chefs do not support the ban of foie gras sounds like a reasonable conclusion.

"Jane Austen's 

Hi, I happen to have Tony1's talk page on my Watchlist left over from some ancient exchange, so I noticed your query about removing the full dates of birth and death of Jane Austen. Discouraging (without banning) month and day of birth or death is not consensus, although it is the strong opinion of many editors, disputed by many others, at at a straw poll currently being  conducted at Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (dates and numbers). Since Jane Austen's editors have apparently decided against having an Information Box (which could display exact birthday and date of death), I think the argument for keeping them quickly accessible in this particular lead is rather stronger. And although I'm more of a Dickensian than an Austenite myself, I know several people in the San Francisco Bay Area who diligently celebrate Jane Austen's birthday with an annual ball. So in my book her birthday would fall in the same class as that of Abraham Lincoln (Kentucky, February 12, 1809 — Washington, D.C., April 15, 1865).",0.0

Go out in a blaze of glory...on my own talk page???  No, that's not my intention at all.  It's a very small venue to go out on, I can assure you.  My intention is simply to tell the truth.  Even if it hurts.  On that, I don't compromise.  If that appears suidical to you, it's a sad indictment on the frequency of truth telling in you neck of the woods.  Others compromise on truth, often because they care about $$$ more than truth.  That's what I believe motivates the deletions on WP and elsewhere regarding monetary reform.  That's why this stuff isn't EVER published in """"mainstream"""" sources.  This stuff is starved of funds until it dies.  People who care about $$$ more than truth hate people pointing this out to them.  Because it hurts.  It shows they aren't very smart, but they are very selfish.  It's as simple as that.

One other thing.  Wealth distribution is a separate and distinct issue from the issue of money creation and distribution.  They are related and they do interact, but they are distinct issues.  Many Libertarians (such as Ron Paul) couldn't care less about wealth distribution provided the way in which money creation is just and in accordance with the U.S. Constitution.  Free markets can determine wealth distribution - provided the way in which money is created is open and democractically approved and """"just"""" and the product of rational discussion (i.e. not based on the threat of a bullet to the head if you question the current method of money creation and distribution).  Once new money is created, it gets gets circulated according to the tax laws, and competition laws, and finance laws and a multitude of other factors, and ends up in someone's account somewhere.  Money creation is (arguably) much more important and has many more dynamic implications for an economy than wealth distribution, which is a separate issue.  Again, this confusion shows that the level of understanding of these issues is woeful and I despair at ever increasing the general public's understanding of these vitally important issues, especially given the limitless $$$s financing the countervailing forces (Gregalton, Zenwhat, etc) that are lined up against anyone questioning the sustainability and pointing out the absolute stupidity of the current debt-based system.

Update: The Oreskes abstracts

 

Naomi Oreskes claims to have analysed 928 abstracts she found listed on the ISI Web of Knowledge database (1993 – 2003) using the keywords """"global climate change."""" However, this claim is incorrect: while the ISI database includes a total of 929 documents for the period in question, it lists only 905 abstracts. It is thus impossible that Oreskes analysed 928 abstracts.

 

In my original critique, I used the same ISI database and the same key words as Oreskes but used all documents listed therein. While Oreskes did not specify the method she applied in her study, she later confirmed that she had limited her search to “articles”, while I included “all document types” in my initial assessment. This difference appears to explain the discrepancy between the “928” abstracts Oreskes claims to have analysed and the 1117 documents I found and considered, although her figures don’t add up, one way or another.

 

Some commentators have argued that these differences undermine my main criticism while they validate Oreskes' claim. However, as I have stressed repeatedly, Oreskes entire argument is flawed as the whole ISI data set includes just 13 abstracts (less than 2%) that explicitly endorse what she has called the 'consensus view.'

 

In fact, the vast majority of abstracts do not mention anthropogenic climate change.

 

I have posted all documents and abstracts listed in the ISI database under the key words “global climate change” (for the period 1993 – 2003) below, arranged by year. Check for yourself! Make sure you differentiate between implicit and explicit endorsement of the IPCC consensus (“[M]ost of the observed warming over the last 50 years is likely to have been due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations."""")

Hello, although this is technically an unblock appeal, it is really only a reason to explain.... you won't be in a mood to unblock me when I'm finished talking... )
First of all I want to apologise, I should have thought before putting the giant swastika on my page. This is the reason for that... I have a few Jewish friends, and normally we sometimes make jokes about jews and christians and things like that. I never really make jokes about the holocaust, because that never go over well with them and it is not nice... well, apparently, a joke about jews being lawyers set one of my closest friends off who is not really a jew, but claims he is.... now he thinks I am a facist, nazi, and I hate jews.... i gotreally frustrated and annoyed and so I came home and started messing around on my userpage... Second of all, i would like to ask why it is not permissable to """"self identify as a nazi""""? There are several userboxes dealing with this subject. There is even a userbox that states, """"This user identifies as a Hitlerist! WHAT THE HELL?!?!?! You will let people say they support Hitler, but you won't let them say they are nazis?!? Being a nazi does not mean that you condone Hitler or his actions, it simple means that you support the theory of the politics behind Nazism.... you can be a nazi and not support the horrible eugenics policy. But if you are hitlerist, that obviously says you support all that... your arguement would of course be that it is offensive to jews.... well if you are taking that into account, then you should also ban anyone that says they identify as a communist. That can be extremely offensive to christians... if you want me to, I can talk about all the horrible things they did to christians in communist russia (with reference of a nice book). I think I will... one of the things they did was putting shackles on the ankles and wrists of christians with spikes of the inside that cut into your skin if you moved at all... and then they put starved rats into your cell that tried to eat you alive so you had to fight them off while your wrists and ankles are killing you. They also tied you to a cross and hung you upside down over a huge pile of other prisoners crammed into a small room. You were then forced to excrete over everyone. You were also stood upright in a box while they drove long nails into it. It was alright if you stood perfectly still, but you would have to stand there for hours and then your body would sway and poke into the nails. They also stood you naked in a freezer with a doctor nearby that signalled when you were freezing to death and then they would take you out and warm you up. They would do that for hours on end. Then they would beat you over and over again asking you to renounce Christ... the holocaust was horrible, but I would rather be gassed or hung by a nazi than endure those tortures for 18 years like one man who wrote a book about his experiences... so could you ban all communists please? 
My last comment is in response to Chzz's question about me making the 'gay comment' statement. Nowadays the word gay is used for two meanings... one is homosexuality and the other is wierd, stupid, dumb... i was using the second connotation.... maybe if you people didn't spend so much time on this gay... sorry... stupid online encyclopedia you would realize how the real world uses words...

I will take a wikibreak... i don't want to become addicted to point of ruining my social life...... i have already recieved a punishment, never becoming an admin (the whole gay... sorry... dumb trust thing)... just know this... i would have enventually removed the swastika after I cooled down and because of your gay... sorry... dumb policy you have lost a serious editor... this whole thing has really annoyed me...

This 'Historian' now thinks that 'Sanhedrin' is closer to Neturei Karta than to Kach. He is also seeing a fusion of Kach and Neturei Karta, since 'both oppose the state'.

Hey Merzul, glad you have a sense of humor too.  There is actually a policy that admins are supposed to follow when a block might be controversial.  Obviosuly the admin in question and I have not seen eye to eye on the talk page of an extreemly controversial subject.  According to that policy he should have mentioned his intent to block me the admin notification board to let the other admins know prior top blocking me.  He did not do that.  He also is obligated to provide me with some specifics which he did not do.  And """"Final warning"""" suggests a previous warning had been given.  I would not be shocked if all my comments here get deleted and he uses WP:Soapbox as an excuse.  Oh well, what are you gonna do.  The only thing that bothers me is I cannot post anything on any of the admin boards to get a question or two answered and I cannot post on NCDave's talk page (he would appreciate the irony here I think).  He also deleted my comments on the talk page yet he leaves dozens of actual viscous attacks done by others there, I attacked no one so this selective enforcement makes me smile too.   I suspect the """"batman"""" comment sent him over the top (I'm Batman).  But we have one guy claiming he's a nuclear scientists and therefore evolution is wrong, another guy (who this Night dude is demonstrably sympathetic too) who claims he's a doctor and has proven evolution to be false, so I figured letting the cat out of the bag and admitting I'm batman was just as relevant (shhh mum's the word, my wife would kill me if she knew I was a crime fighter).  The talk page is obviously not a place for people to claim they can/have proven evolution to be wrong nor is it a good place to appeal to one's own authority.  But, in Nightguy's eyes I guess you can claim you're a nuclear scientist but claiming to be batman somehow violates some policy. 

To be clear, I'm seeing this as idiotically funny and not ranting against admins or Wikipedia.  Anyhow, here's to appreciating the occassional absurdity in life!  19:15""",0.14285714285714285

 From women's basketball to AAC to Ruddy Shelducks (with an SI sidetrack) 

Did you ever watch Connections (TV series)?

I was reminded of it today.

I've been working on articles on basketball coaches, which led to wanting  to see who will be in the American Athletic Conference next season, which led me to wodnering who wrote that well-researched article, so I decided to see who was working on it, which led me to you.

I noticed that Sarah left you a note indicating she was involved with the Smithsonian; I have a to-do item to talk to someone abut the Terms of Use of the Smithsonian, so I think I will contact Sarah.

I noticed you have a lot of interest in birds, and I'm trying to figure out how to respond to an OTRS email which involves birds, so here goes. Someone has provided an image that they believe are Ruddy Shelducks in Texas, and believes that is unusual. We aren't, as you know, into OR, and simply reporting that this is a photo of the bird in Texas feels ORish. But I'm out of my depth, so wondered if you had some thoughts.(Talk) """,0.0

   Hey Einstein, when did I say anything anti-africanist here?? please point it out for me. I'm even against the CIA sources that some people wanted to place on the article here, the one about 73% mulatto,16% white and 11% black.  Do you think that I'm going to be crazy enough to believe DR is only 11% Black??  I'll be too ashamed of saying such a thing.  I agree on you on that one. 51% mulatto, 46% black, 2% white is the real demographic approximates of DR. Where is the """" denial, anti-black, blaha blah and all the non-sense accusations that you are making by me saying that??
   I stated an increase from 11% that somebody else place here from CIA to 46%, that's an increase of 35. So I am the anti-black, racist,denier??? 

   I knew that you where going to throw the """" Moor myth"""" about Spaniards, you are showing the radical afrocentric nut. What's next? you also believe in Van Sertima's book, that the Olmec heads of the Yucatan peninsula are Africans? or that snow is really black??
   DNA studies in Spaniards show that less than 2% have Moor blood. It has been weed out,since the fall of Cordova in 1236, by the """" limpieza de sangre"""" campaign of the christians. Spaniards are White as are the anglo-saxons,and the Irish. I'm not going into deep details about """" Moors and Spain"""" with a radical Afrocentric nut, but going back to the article, we are not going to allow that the DR article is going to get hijack by radical afrocentric nut, nor eurocentric too. As you can see, I'm not eurocentric, 16% white to 2% white, do the math. 

    You think that you where going to deal with an ignoramus, but when it comes to history, you are kindergarten compared to me. You say """" society"""" says that such words are offensive? wow, impresive answer. you are a clown.

"Combined Anatolian-Kurgan hypothesis 

I now think that the Proto-Indo-Europeans lived in present-day Turkey.  Yet the Kurgan culture does play an important role in the evolution of Indo-European languages.  I think it was founded by Indo-Europeans which immigrated to the Pontic steppe.  The ones which did not leave were cultural ancestors of the speakers of Anatolian languages.  The language of the Kurgan culture gave rise to all other Indo-European languages.  These include all the ones spoken today.

There were several early splinter groups from the Kurgan culture.  Three of these were the cultural ancestors of the Armenians, Greeks and Albanians.  There may have been more but the languages descended from theirs are so poorly documented we don’t know much of them.

A larger splinter group from Kurgan culture was the Beaker people.  This metalworking pastoral people spread over much of Europe.  The areas were they settled includes almost all of West-Central Europe, the Italian and Iberian Peninsulas, the large islands between them, the British Islands, Southern Scandinavia and probably parts of Eastern Europe north of the grasslands.  With such a widespread culture they soon developed several different languages.  These were ancestral of the Baltic, Slavic, Germanic, Celtic and Italic (including Romatic) ones.

The Kurgan people themselves developed into the Proto-Indo-Iranians, many of which returned to the Middle East.  With the Aryan migration to northern India the Indo-Aryan languages eventually splintered from the Iraniac ones.  This happened not long before these two peoples started to write as Avestan and Vedic are relatively similar.

What do you think about this hypothesis?  No “the Urheimat must be my country because we are the most superior/unique/original” argument, please!  No people in the world are intrinsically superior to any other ones.  It is questionable if any people are “uniquely unique”.  The most original of the living Indo-European languages is probably Lithuanian.  Yet no-one who is not a Lithuanian have seriously suggested the Indo-European Urheimat to be in Lithuania.

 A hit list for Jews 
There is a site called Jew Watch out there (I'll let you find the link) which specialises in """"keeping an eye on Jewish activities"""".  It is used as a reference site by anti-semites the world around.  Jew Watch makes it a point to make sure that they do not, under any circumstances, list someone who they cannot confirm 100% is Jewish.  Stormfront, a white supremist web forum, uses Jew Watch all of the time.

The criteria for inclusion on List of British Jews is the same criteria used by Jew Watch.  It is a criteria designed for anti-semites.  It is a criteria that is aimed in hurting Jews.

Jewish communities do not have such a criteria.  They allow anyone to be considered to be a Jew if they have any linkage with the Jewish community, through race, religion or culture.  This is the normal criteria that is used.  If your father is Jewish, then per Jewish community standards, you are Jewish.  And so forth.

Wikipedia as a whole has certain criteria for verifiability.  But these criteria are not being applied to this list.  This is being changed purely because this is a Jewish list.  Whilst Slim Virgin and her friends have claimed that this is in order to stop muslim terrorists, this is plainly not true.  If we are worried about terrorists strapping bombs to their bodies and blowing up Jews, then this list shouldn't exist at all.  And we should especially not try to focus on who are the """"real Jews"""".  Wikipedia are changing their rules, purely to push an anti-semetic point of view.  And while Slim Virgin goes around claiming that others who oppose her are neo-nazis, and ignoring their strong ties to the Jewish community, she herself has been unable to answer the questions about her own religious hatred.  And this is the same person who has supported muslim POV pushers, who have written vehement anti-semetic text throughout Wikipedia.  Slim Virgin has been a catalyst for banning people who have opposed these islamofascists.  Slim Virgin is an anti-semite.

Right now, I would encourage deletion of this list.  It is being run by anti-semites and used to harm all Jewish people.  Until such time as Slim Virgin can be banned from editing this and related pages, it is dangerous to continue to have such a page.  It is encouraging hatred of Jews.""",0.14285714285714285

RSA Labss (Now EMC), MIT, and ACM are wrong? 
VQuaker.  I am used to accepting correction when it is due, but for the life of me I cannot understand why cited information from a primary source (RSA Labs) on the fourth factor of authentication is not worth knowing.  I am confronted with the information that because it is not a legal requirement as far as you know, it must be spurious.  Some people know that it's better to get their legal information from government sources, not Wikipedia.  If you are holding up this resource as some type of CFR or USC guide, exposition, or sanctioned resource, then I believe the U.S. Government would like to hear your ideas.  Further, """"someone you know"""" (or knows you) is part of network administrationwhich is part of the brilliance.  Needing a cohort or supervisor to provide a human factor is difficult to defeat.  Though, I suspect you know this already.  I'm not offended though, just immensely confused as to why this item of access control must be devoid of technical information and meet some arbitrary legal standard.  I would ask you this: if a user loses their SmartCard (i.e. CAC) and forgets their password, with the premise being that biometric devices or other inherence factor methodologies are not deployed, in most situations does an administrator with knowledge of the user ask they be terminated, or do they reissue credentials based on knowing the person?  There are organizations that will terminate you, but I couldn't have said that in my expounding of the 4th factor because it would mean citing information not available to the lay. (I do hope I can """"talk"""" without citing what those in DF and IS would consider common knowledge.)  When we set out, it was to provide reliable information, if the mission has changed, well who could tell?  Consider me a non-contributor from now onwe aren't allowed to use Wikipedia anyway where I work, it is an anathema.  Say what you want unless it surprises someone and then an ego check is issued. I should expect nothing less, after all, I teach.  What changed the tone was your dumbing-down and use of nonsensical examples that could not be used to authenticate someone.  Smell?  Non-sequitur.  You gave me things to read, but I'm still waiting for you to cite Wikipedia's policy that information be legally sanctioned and in the format expected by a barrister.  I cited my sourcewhere is the citation that the language style, organization, and applicability be in-line with one or more regulatory bodies?

Now a better way to be proactive would be to realize that academic databases (do you have access to them [Elsevier, JSTOR, EDAS, IEEE, SpringerLink], they can be pricey if you try and yet without them you're stuck in a Google funk, but I digress) are full of references to fourth factor.  That cash register key the manager uses when you return something, yep, someone you know.  An that's been around for decades!  Sign up for an account with an ISP, there it is again!  Take joy in knowing you have some sheriff star and are for the most part helpful.  I just didn't realize you alone set these standards.  I repent in ashes and wrend my sackcloth accordingly.

 Soviet War Memorial (Treptower Park) 

Hi there, in regards to Soviet War Memorial (Treptower Park), please do not re-insert that information into the article, as it fails verification. The source which was used states:

The rape of Germany left a bitter legacy. It contributed to the unpopularity of the East German communist regime and its consequent reliance on the Stasi secret police. The victims themselves were permanently traumatised: women of the wartime generation still refer to the Red Army war memorial in Berlin as """"the Tomb of the Unknown Rapist"""".

It does not state WHICH memorial, and the inclusion in this article represents original research. As a Berliner, you know there are 3 Soviet war memorials, and throwing random epitaphs into articles based upon ones guess is not encyclopaedic. There is also evidence that people have not cited the other sources, and if they keep pushing the line that they have cited the material, and reinsert it into the article, I will present evidence which proves that 1) they have not read the material at all or 2) have blatantly falsified the references for inclusion into the article, and I will be asking for sanctions against anyone who reinserts it. This has been raised on the talk page, and editors have refused to provide cites from those sources. As there is also evidence of some of these editors also engaging in original research by placing into articles things which are not mentioned in those sources, this is egregious original research, and given the nature of the information inserted, it can be seen as a blatant breach of WP:DIGWUREN. I would suggest that you not re-insert, as you will not want to get caught up in this. The next person to re-insert it will be reported to WP:AE.  Dialogue """,0.0

This is the text i struggle to post in G.91 page. Just to realize how i want to contribute to wiki, and how someone don't want i do it:

The Aeritalia G.91, also known as the Fiat G.91 and nicknamed Gina, was an light Italian fighter aircraft that was intended to serve as standard equipment for NATO air forces in the 1960s. It was eventually only adopted by three - the Italian Air Force, West Germany's Luftwaffe, and the Portuguese Air Force, but enjoyed a long service life that extended over 35 years.

Development
In 1953, European aircraft manufacturers were invited by NATO to submit aircraft for evaluation for the Light Weight Strike Fighter (LWSF) role. The G.91 was designed to the specification by the famous Italian engineer Giuseppe Gabrielli, hence the """"G"""" designation. The competition was intended to produce an aircraft that was light, small, expendable, equipped with basic weapons and avionics and capable of operating with minimal ground support. These specifications were developed for two reasons: the first was the nuclear threat and the other was to counter the trend towards larger and more expensive aircraft.

The technical requirements were: 
 1,100 m take-off distance over a 15 m obstacle
 Capability to operate from grass strips and streets
 Max speed of 0.95 Mach
 Range of 280 km with 10 min over the target
 Armoured protection for the pilot and the fuel tanks
 4x12.7 mm or 2x20 mm or 30 mm guns
 A maximum of 2,200 kg empty weight and 4,700 kg max weightFerrari 1992, p. 83.

The challengher proposals must had been presented within two months after the request.
The projecting work was only apparently an easy task, because making a very small aircraft yet capable to cover these NATO specifications was difficult. 

Fiat Aviazione presented G.91 and so did other competitors with a total of 10 projects, analysed since 18 March by AGARD (Advisory Group for Aeronautical Research and Development), led by Theodore Von Karman. The finalists were declared Breguet Taon, Dassault Etendard, Fiat G.91 and Folland Gnat. Another interesting project was Sud Aviation Badoleur, that solved drastically the problem of a proper landing undercarriage, simply omitted and sobstitued with a landing and take off skid (aircraft was moved in ground operations with a special trailer). This, however, was not ufficially presented to AGARD, that choose, on paper, the Taon as winner.

In the meanwhile, there was the problem of the engine, that must been light yet enough powerful and reliable, with easy and cheap maintenance, like the whole aircraft. The solution was realized by Bristol with the Bristol Orpheus, a simple and effective turbojet. It was adopted to all the finalists, so Bristol will won the contest in every case. G.91R, presented by Fiat, was also called 'little Sabre'. It was due by the knowledge gained with license-production of a modern aircraft, the F-86K, that helped to make much experience with advanced jet aircrafts, . It was similar to F-86 as overall design, but smaller and capable to operate from semi-prepared airstrips.

G.91R was 20% heavier than the estimates and this was due partly to testing hardware, but it was powered by a Bristol Orpheus B.Or 801, 1,800 kg/t. 
It was yet capable to supersonic speed in dives, as shown by the flight made in 20 February 1957 when it was able to break the sound barrier four times with 9,000 m dives. His test pilot Riccardo Bignamini, a famous one of that times (he won McKenna Trophy at Empire Test School) was a key element to solve the G.91 shortcomings and the first flight was made in 9 August 1956 at Torino-Caselle airfield.

I'm typing this with the green-on-black skin on. It mostly works now, if you make sure that in your Monobook.js the variable Gerbrant.hidePane is set to the following value:

You can for example wrap it in the following, or any other way that's okay in JavaScript. (The rationale behind this settings scheme is that I use various scripts, some of my own, some of which have settings, and some written by others, which may have settings as well, so I wanted to be sure settings for my scripts are in a seperate namespace, where they can't touch or clash with those of other scripts.)
 Gerbrant = {

I may need some time to iron out a little bug, but at least it works. As for the other problem, this is caused by the script's (i.e. my) assumption that either the interwiki list or the toolbox is the last menu. If this isn't true for some reason, things can go wrong. I'll try to fix this if I can find a good test script to work with.

Not sure where to put this; the talk page seems to have fragmented, and nothing is in chronological order anymore.  This section looks like as good a place as any.

Just in case you're looking for an outside opinion, analogous to an admin closing an AFD: For reasons unrelated to this content decision, I spent last night looking at this entire talk page (not the archives, thank God).  After reading it all, I figured I might as well put that to some use.  It is my opinion that there is no consensus to add the war crimes information to the article in any form, and that achieving such a consensus is not going to happen at this time, and further discussion is going to amount to going around and around in circles, with no benefit.  Since no consensus for controversial information defaults to """"don't include"""", I think it should not be included, and you should all move on.

I note that """"consensus"""" does not mean unanimity; there is no obligation to discuss this until everyone agrees.  Otherwise, AFD's would last several years.  I cannot imagine any possible compromise wording that would gain a consensus for inclusion.  I actually have no strong opinion on the inclusion itself; just an outside take on how your consensus building is going.

Non-binding, of course, but to be honest, there's a 95% chance that that's what formal mediation would end up telling you anyway.  Accept this, or ignore it, I don't care; just thought you'd like a completely uninvolved opinion.   """,0.0

 BLACK DAHLIA MURDER IS NOT 'MELODIC DEATH METAL'!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THEY ARE DEATHCORE PUSSIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

Black Dahlia Murder IS NOT Melodic Death Metal. They are the farthest band from that genre. Black Dahlia Murder are pieces of shit scene bitches that are trying to be """"METAL"""" along with all of the other Deathcore/Grindcore bands like Job For A Cowboy, Suicide Silence, etc. Fuck all of them! They aren't true Metal and they never will be, they need to stick to what they know...American Eagle, MTV, and all of their other lame trends. Melodic Death Metal is Scar Symmetry, In Flames, Sonic Syndicate, and Disarmonia Mundi. Melodic Death Metal is REAL music, it's not a disgrace to music like Deathcore and Grindcore.

I will continue to change Black Dahlia CUNT'Murder's genre to Deathcore/Grindcore, I don't give a shit..I'm not letting you stupid scene bitches take away the only thing that you and the Mainstream hasn't destroyed and that's the amazing genre of Melodic Death Metal. So fuck all of you trendy conformists, go fucking die.

Black Dahlia Murder are Deathcore pussies that need to be beheaded, them and all of the other Deathcore bands that are ruining Metal.

Deathcore is the biggest piece of shit I've ever heard...it shouldn't even be considered music, it's a bunch of pussy scene kids trying to be """"METAL"""". Deathcore and Grindcore are the two worst forms of music ever invented.

So yeah, you can listen to Deathcore if you enjoy hearing """"music"""" that has no tempo or beat to it whatsoever, they pretty much just hit random shit on the drums and play random notes on the Guitar while the vocalist does terrible random screaming and pig squels. Don't forget the hillarious millions of breakdowns they put into their songs.

""""DA...THIS SONG IS CALLED BIG FUCKING TREE!""""

""""Ya boi....we are so down wit American Eagle..ya boi, my hair does that flippy thing.. RAWR RAWR RAWR I'M SO LYK HARDCORES OMGZ@!!!@@!!!! GAGES AND SNAKE BITES RAWWWRRR""""

Fuck Job for a Cowboy and Black Dahlia Murder, trendy pieces of shit.

Melodic Death Metal owns all. 

There really isn't much of a difference between any """"Deathcore"""" band for that matter, they are all just a bunch of pussies that are trying to fit in with this new trend of trying to be a """"Metal"""" band.

So please don't try to tell me """"OH...YOUR STUPID...THE BANDS AREN'T THE SAME.""""

Ok, so maybe....JUST MAYBE.. Job For A Cowboy's vocalist does 3 more pig squels in a second than the vocalist from Black Dahlia Murder, there I said it! I guess they aren't all the same!!!! Oh dear fuck ..... And my bad...my bad, White Chapel actually does 200 breakdowns in a minute rather than Suicide Silence's 100 breakdowns in a minute. My bad dude you were right all along!! Deathcore and Grindcore bands aren't all the same!!!!!!!!!

But seriously, the genre is pure shit and is just another trend in the music industry that bands are following to """"make it to the top"""" and to fit in with the rest of the bands these days.

I mean, I have nothing against every band in a certain genre sounding the same or anything, but when the """"music"""" of the genre they produce is pure shit and can be done by any living human being on Earth...then I have to draw the line. It doesn't take much talent to do shittty raw screaming, hit random notes on a guitar, and hit your double bass pedal at like 500bpm.

Another reason why I don't take any bands from this genre seriously is their hillarious excuses for a """"band logo"""".

They try oh so hard to be """"HARDDCOREEEEE"""".

I also find it funny that all of these pussy bands have names like, """"ANAL CUNT"""" or """"DEAD DEATH BLOODY DEAD HAND"""".

Fact is, any band that produces """"music"""" under this genre sucks and is just trying to fit-in.

YA BOI! LETS HARDCORE DANCE! RAHHHH YAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Grindcore and Deathcore isn't Metal so all you douchebags should just give up....you aren't Metal and you never will be, go fall into a pool of AID's.

I think that the reputation of the Marine Corps has more to do with its actual historical performance on the battlefield, rather than considerations such as the selectivity of its recruitment or basic training, something that probably would distinguish it in the """"European"""" perspective that you cite.
Another consideration is the scope, size and responsibility of the Corps.  The Marine Corps is not and has never been organized across its entire organization as a """"special-operations-type"""" organization, such as the SEALs, Special Forces, or, if you will, Royal Marines or SAS.  The article points out that the Corps is larger than the British Army in its entirety.  What the Marine Corps has done for most of its history, and what has distinguished it largely from the US Army, is serve as a mobile and convenient expeditionary force, in coordination with the Navy, in a large number of small actions in support of US policy, most of them in the Western Hemisphere or in Asia.  (THe US didn't even maintain a large standing peacetime Army until after 1945).  Outside those years when a major war was being fought (technically, the US Congress has declared war only five times in history), if someone saw an armed American in their country, that person was likely to be a Marine.
I would argue that the most relevant perspective on the reputation of the Marine Corps would be the perspectives and memories of its historical enemies.  I would invite anyone interested, and will work myself, to find and document in this article reliable quotes and sources of those who have encountered Marines in battle.

Is Samurai Champloo important enough to be included in this article? It doesn't seem to add much to the article. Why's every article I look at have some reference to anime?

Why does every other article I read have reference to some American Sitcom or other live-action medium? It's a part of popular culture, that's why. The Sunflower Samurai as well as Sunflowers themselves are a HUGE central plot point that dominates almost every single episode.

So post it in the Samurai Champloo article. Anime is not central nor even moderately relevant to actual sunflowers.

If it is at the end, labeled, and sufficiently known information, why not have it?

Heliotropic flowers are more prevalent among plants in alpine areas.

DrPizza, I'm saddened by the way your actions in regard to the NTFS article reflect poorly on the nature of editting in Wikipedia.  I hope you learn the lesson of communication that makes Wikipedia operate as such a success.  Your method of editting, as it looks for my standpoint (and from your wording of that response and from in here) comes out directly across as wanting to stomp out the opinions of others and hurt the feelings of others if they don't agree with you  whether that was your intention or not, that's how it came across and I noted that in the NTFS talk page to your last post (for which I'm writing this response) due to your exact wording the talk page.   If this was not your intention, then you should be more careful about your wording.  Please learn to work together as a member of the Wikipedia team, not aiming to tear down others.  Thank you.

"""==Celtic Language?==

It says in the article that after St. Patrick was captured he began to learn """"the Celtic language.""""  It is commonly agreed among Irish historians that the Irish are not actually Celtic (e.g. the Irish learned the Celtic style of art from communication with the European mainland, etc.).  So did they speak the Celt language? I defer to an expert on this one. 

To be more precise, what the article means is that he learned """"a Goidelic language"""" or """"the Old Irish language"""". Patrick would have already spoken a Brythonic language and some Latin. Depending on exactly where he came from in Britain, he might have known a Goidelic language as well. Celtic languages and Insular Celtic languages explain how Goidelic and Brythonic may have been related to each other and to other Celtic languages.   (Talk) 

Are you kidding?  Please identify your source in claiming that """"is commonly agreed among Irish historians that the Irish are not actually Celtic.""""  Recent research has revealed that the Celts did not displace pre-celtic peoples but Celts did come to Ireland and the predominant culture remained celtic until English colonization.  Second, Gaeilge is a celtic language of the Q-celtic branch of the Celtic language family, thus the Irish of Patrick's day spoke a celtic language and it is assumed that Patrick learned said language.  Ergo, he learned a celtic language (though, as noted above, he probably already spoke a P-celtic brythonic language prior to his enslavement.

I have seen broken dates for specific invasions of the British Isles from mainland europe during the collapse of the Roman empire, these not only include Picts, Scots, Irish, Angles and Saxons and more bizzarely English! I will have to dig the book out with dates.  

St. Patrick: Fact and Fiction

I have removed 'was captured by Niall Noigiallach' as it is an obvious error. I will try to come back some time in the future and help with citation and new material.

What are the sources for the following statments?

1 - """"born Patricius Magonus Sucatus""""
2 - """" seems to have studied at the monastery of Lérins on the Côte d'Azur from 412 to 415 ...He spent the next 15 years at Auxerre were he became a disciple of Saint Germanus of Auxerre and was ordained possibly about 417.""""
3 - """"Saint Germanus consecrated Patrick bishop about 431, and sent him to Ireland to succeed Saint Palladius, the first bishop, who had died earlier that year. """"
4 - """"There was some contact with the pope. Patrick visited Rome in 442 and 444. """"
5 - """"Popular devotion to Patrick began in France, long before Sucat received the noble title of Patricius""""

These and other statments seriously mar what is otherwise a fairly good and reasonably well written article. Also the chronology implicit in them is all over the place. The fact of the matter is that no one know for sure what the dates of Patrick's life are; those of 461 (arriving in Ireland) and 491 (death) are estimates arrived at only after decades of discussion. Will whoever rewrote this article please show the basis for including these statments. Thank you. 

I've re-revised the article again in line with what I wrote above, for the simple reason that Pcassidy reverted back to his version again without citing sources for statments I take issue with. I dislike doing this unilaterally because it is against the spirit of wikipedia, but it seems I have to draw attention to this in some manner other than being polite. , 18:52 pm, 18th April 2005. 

 I did? Where? I just checked through my edits and all I can find is reverts of blatant vandalism and one weird edit (documented below). I also reverted """"confession"""" -> """"confessio"""" in the last two weeks or so - is this what you are referring to? - (talk) 18:11, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)

Hello Pete, glad to hear from you. The basic issues I have with the article as you wrote it - forgive me if I have mistaken you for another editor - are outlined above. I have no problem whatsoever with them being included in an article concerning Pat, so long as they are placed under some heading along the lines of """"Speculations about St. Patrick"""". Because we know so very little about Patrick I really feel it is vital to seperate facts, speculation and hagiography. And - I mean no offense - much of what I have outlined above falls under the latter two categorys. Thank you for your time. , 22:08",0.0

Words of Encouragement to user """"Damemk"""" in the cases of dispute with the users engaged in Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda
Damemk, You have come to the same conclusions about Bulgarian 19th Century Nationalistic Propaganda on English Wikipedia.
User:Laveol is one of the most prominent editors on Wikipedia contributing false information in the articles about Republic of Macedonia, Macedonian Nation|History|Language|Culture|Sports and what else not.
He is spending a lot of time working on his cause, pushing Bulgarian Nature in the articles of the domain of Republic of Macedonia.
How far has he gone in pushing this propaganda you can see at Wikipedia:WikiProject_ROMacedonia where he has listed himself as a member.
So just my few words of concern for the Macedonian Articles in English Wikipedia, and the great damage done by User:Laveol and other users with the Bulgarian and Anti-Macedonian Propaganda.
Hopefully with the internet access becoming more affordable to the people in Republic of Macedonia the things will go in right direction: Removing the Bulgarian Propaganda from Macedonian articles, cleaning them of false fabricated information, and giving the facts to the world, and the views of the Macedonian Science and sources.
I don't have much time now, but hopefully will be able to find some more in the coming period. I am open to any collaboration|effort for the above goals.

I am expecting that this user """"Laveol"""" will continue with the Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda and polluting the domains in the domain of Republic of Macedonia, simply because he is able to, and can find a ways to continue to work on his agenda.
Ours is to try to remove these false claims and contribute the Facts about the Macedonia, Macedonian Nation|History|Lanugage|Culture|Sports.

Damemk, I hope you write something here, at least to show that User_talk:Damemk and User_talk:Ejanev is not the same user.    

Some insight into my user name Ejanev
The only user I am using to contribute to Wikipedia is """"Ejanev"""". It is composed of the first letter of my name """"Emil"""" and my last name """"Janev"""".
User """"Damemk"""" is a separate user. Probably that user name is comming from """"Dame"""" - a Macedonian First name, and """"mk"""" or the code of """"Republic of Macedonia"""".
It does happen that I am from Canada. I was born in Republic of Macedonia and have lived there until I moved to USA first and Canada before more than 3 years.

And yes, having all the false information from the Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda ( originating from the 19th century ) and having it into 21st century to be used to negate the Macedonian Nation and all it's attributes by users as """"Laveol"""", is the reason of some of my editing actions in Wikipedia.
I am not the only user/editor from Republic of Macedonia or with Macedonian origin that has the same views for this Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda, that already is infiltrated in the Macedonian articles.
You can watch the contributions of Special:Contributions/Laveol and see that more than 50% of his actions are engagement in negating the Macedonian Nation and its attributes.

 The lies in how he built the clock 

I was reading the following section and I see lots of issues of truth in it:

""""His father, Mohamed Elhassan Mohamed, said that on Monday morning, September 14, 2015, he drove his son to school and encouraged him to display his technological ability.[4]

In an interview on Al Jazeera's Ali Velshi on Target, Mohamed said the clock was """"built from scrap around the house"""" and that """"some of the boards were already manufactured.""""[5] He told Larry Wilmore on The Nightly Show that it took him """"10 or 20 minutes"""" to put it together and that he has built more complicated items, but that the clock was simple, using some parts that were scrapped off so that it was easier.[6] According to the initial report in The Dallas Morning News, he had done this """"before bed on Sunday. [September 13, 2015]""""[7]""""

Nowhere is there a paragraph underneath that should write """"While Ahmed claims he built the clock from """"scrap"""", it is well known among tech enthusiasts that it is simply the components of a digital clock with no cover. So what I'm asking, is it alright to add sources that show he was lying? 

Lie 1: Some of the boards were already manufactured - should be """"All of the boards...""""

Lie 2: There were no external 'scrap' parts other than the ones that come from a commercial clock""",0.0

"Malabarian Jewish - Nasrani tradition

Hi Veliath, you are right the page Nasrani should be redirected to the page Syrian malabar nasrani, or to the page Syriac Christianity.

it was originally redirected to Syriac Christianity but several vandals tampered with the pages on syrian malabar nasrani and st thomas christians. In fact there was an entire section on st thomas christians explaining its nasrani context which was systematically destroyed by vandals. Instead they wrote in factually inaccurate statements about the st thomas christians being marathas and telegu which is still there on the page Saint Thomas Christians.

here I post to you the passages destroyed by the vandals:

>>>>>

This article deals with the Saint Thomas Christian churches and denominations of the Nasrani people

The Saint Thomas Christians (Malayalam: Nasrani) are a group of Christians from the Malabar coast (now Kerala) in South India, who follow Syriac Christianity. The different groups and denominations within the St Thomas Christians together form the Nasrani people. Their tradition goes back to the very beginnings of first century Christian thought, and the seven churches that are believed to have been established by St. Thomas the Apostle.

Nasrani and Saint Thomas Christian tradition

The Nasranis are an ethnic people and in that sense a single community. However the Nasranis have various denominations as a result of Portuguese persecution. As an ethnic community they refer to themselves as Nasranis referring to the common cultural heritage and cultural tradition. However as a religious group they refer to themselves as the Mar Thoma Khristianis or in English as Saint Thomas Christians referring to the various and diverse religious denominations between them in terms of their religious tradition, despite a common ancestory of being the descendants of the early Mar Thoma church or Saint Thomas tradition of Christianity.

These first century churches, according to tradition, were, from north to south: Palayoor near Guruvayoor/Kunnankulam, Cranganore (believed to be the ancient Muziris of Pliny, and the Periplus, on the north bank of Periyar River today), Paravoor on the south side of Periyar, Gokkamangalam or Kokkamangalam, Niranam, Chayal or Nilakkal (the only inland church) and the Lakes or Kaayals, and finally Kollam. The visit of the Apostle Thomas to these places and to Mylapore on the East coast of India can be read in the Ramban Song of Thomas Ramban, set into modern writing c. 1500.

I have prepared a possible replacement map on the left.  It shows all countries classified by the IMF as advanced in blue.

"Civil Constitution of the Clergy
The Roman Catholic Church was the dominating religion until the Revolution of 1789, when the revolutionaries sought to overthrow not only the monarchy and its supporters, but also the whole social and political system, including the Church. Although the Church survived the revolution, according to the ideology of the new republic it could no longer remain a separate estate with its own possessions. Therefore, the new government confiscated the land and assets belonging to the Church and auctioned them off to help resolve the financial problems that had led to the revolution. The state also attempted a huge restructuring of the Church hierarchy and demanded that the clergy swear allegiance to the French government ahead of the Church. Only a small percentage of priests complied with this request, but nevertheless this attempt to bring the Catholic Church under state control can be seen as the beginning of the development of secularism in France.

As a description of the events of 1790, this lacks both neutrality and accuracy. The National Assembly did not conduct an entire revolution of the structure of society; they confiscated Church land to pay the national debt. (If they had, what would have been left for the Jacobins of 1793 to do?)",0.0

HHHH Here is a clarification. The original Semitic people came from Arabia, they moved north and east. After time, the Semitic people devised many dialects of """"Semitic"""". Those dialects became known as """"Languages"""" after diversification. Ishmael with his mother moved to the Arabic concentrated area. Ishmael learned Arabic and married an Arab girl. He begot Arab children from their mothers side. Those children again married Arab. This continued until those children became a big tribe called Quraysh or Quraish, reknowed for the perfection of their dialect of Arabic & for being a strong and honored tribe among the Arabs. Their DNA would have been diluted nearly completely by the Arab tribe Ishmael joined. But as we know the Y chromasome is passed down by the father. Hence it is relavent to state that Quraysh's male population would have had a great affinity geneticly to Ishmael, the non-Arab.

 UPDATE 

I don't have time for another long post, but I would like to share a site that you can use.  http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/shilohshepherd.htm

This site also includes 

ARBA = American Rare Breed Association
APRI = American Pet Registry Inc.
NKC = National Kennel Club

However, my research has proven that many other """"registries"""" are also selling papers for Shiloh Shepherds!!  These include, but are not limited to .....

Other All-Breed Registries: 

The following is a list of some of the other all-breed registries in existence in North America — Caution should be exercised when dealing with a breeder who registers with any of these registries, especially when the breed is recognized by any of the major all-breed registries listed above. Many breeders use these registries because they are not able to meet the more demanding requirements of the CKC, AKC, or UKC. 

The information shown in quotations was taken directly from the registry's web site and speaks for itself as to the goals of some of these registries. 

American Canine Association (ACA) — """"America's largest veterinary health tracking purebred canine registry."""" — Note: In the """"Find A Puppy"""" section of their website, dog/puppy seekers are referred to pet/retail stores. Very little information is available on the website regarding their goals or mission as a registry. 

American Purebred Registry (APR) — The APR issues registration certificates for dogs and cats. They start a pedigree file with the information the owner sends them. Once APR accepts an application, a registration certificate is issued and the animal is considered registered. APR is a record keeping agency only and does not sponsor dog shows, field trials or competitions of any kind. On the application, the owner certifies that the dog or cat is a purebred representative of the breed. They take the owner's word for it and no proof is required. 

America's Pet Registry Inc. (APRI) — """"An internationally recognized association of responsible pet owners, breeders, distributors, veterinarians, retailers, pet product manufacturers, and other concerned parties dedicated to the humane care of animals, the preservation of quality bloodlines, and the individual's right of pet ownership."""" APRI recently re-incorporated as a for-profit corporation. — The APRI promotes and encourages the sale of dogs and cats through distributors and retailers. """"America's Pet Registry, Inc. was begun as insurance for the pet industry..."""" """"APRI offers free dual registrations on dogs from reputable registration services to professional breeders. We classify a professional breeder as one who has three or more breeding females and who regularly sells puppies in the pet market."""" 

Animal Registry Unlimited (ARU) — Some statements found on the opening page of their website: """"We register all pets and animals."""" """"We guarantee that your pet or animal can be registered with us."""" """"Providing a registry for the development of new breeds of useful pets and animals. Unlike many organizations we encourage the development of new breeds."""" 

Continental Kennel Club (CKC) — Note: This registry is also known as the CKC and should not be confused with the Canadian Kennel Club — These are two completely separate registries.) — The Continental Kennel Club recognizes 450 breeds as purebred. The Continental Kennel Club has a section known as """"Miscellaneous Breed Registration"""" which allows for the crossing of two purebred parents of different breed types to produce hybrid puppies. Registered as MISC/BREED1-BREED2 and isolated from purebred registrations, they are distinguished from other breeds on registration certificates by having """"non-purebred"""" printed on their registration certificates. In addition, the Continental Kennel Club has a section within their club for developing new breeds. Stock used for these breeding programs is listed in the """"Development Class"""". The Continental Kennel Club has implemented a classified section on their site where club members can advertise their breeds. If you have a look at some of the more popular breeds such as the Cocker Spaniel, some of the kennels advertising there include breeders of cock-a-poos and other crosses. The Continental Kennel Club's website provides very little information regarding their goals or mission as a registry. For more information, however, there is a very thorough web page at: Continental Kennel Club FAQ.

Homosexuality in Ancient Greece

Do homosexuals like you get turned on at the thought that these great ancient people's may have accepted homosexuality? Why do you have to distort history to fit your image? 

first off there is no concrete evidence that alexander liked it up the butt...let's get that straight...no pun intended

second i'm sure there was gay shit back in the day, like in every culture...but i don't believe everyone was doing it....just because you find two pots out of a 1000 that show some gay act...doesn't mean everyone back then was gay

third...there is a difference between brotherly love and being gay or a pedophile...i say i love my friends and in greece i even kiss them on the cheek when i see them..that doesn't mean i want their ass...look at shaq and wade slapping each other's ass in basketball are you telling me they are gay?

fourth...just because some plays back in the day reffered to certain people being gay...doesn't mean they were...alot of plays (especially comedies) were made to be critical or make fun of people by dehumanizing them or making them look stupid...like calling them gay...just look at comedies now making fun of people...someone might say the president today is gay in a comedy skit, but we all know he is straight

fifth...i hate gay propaganda...i know they are people blah blah blah...but to try to impose on a great culture some of their values to justify their way of life is pathetic...just because there are no great gay people in history doesn't mean you have to ripout pieces of history to make your people look good....from alexander to hitler to lincoln...you guys try to change history or make things up to fit your own cause

i leave with quotes from two authors who wrote gay stuff on alexander

Some modern historians point out that the ancient sources cannot be considered definitive. Robin Lane Fox writes: """"Later gossip presumed that Bagoas was Alexanders lover. This is uncertain."""" [16] And, according to Mary Renault, who wrote a novel about the relationship of Alexander and Bagoas, """"No historian states plainly whether they were physical lovers."""" [17]

SlimVirgin did raise the issue of tautology and I addressed it by saying that we need to write about welfare in the context of non-human animals.  You seem to think this is an impossible task, since we are human.  I reject this idea.  We can write about many non-human things.  Obviously, our ability to know about the welfare of a dog (for example) is limited by the fact that we are not dogs, but that does not change what animal welfare is.

Ok, first off, let me clarify that reverting is when you undo someone else's edit (yes, it does include the re-addition of material that has been removed by another user). Your use of the word """"vandalism"""" is incorrect in this case, because everything that you have been involved in so far is classified as a """"content dispute"""", since you and your opponents have been disputing whether certain text should be included. This is not a case of vandalism (this is, for example). Secondly, many of the users that you have been reverting or the ones that have been reverting you are on the same restrictions, so IMO now everyone is equal, and no one is """"winning"""" or """"losing"""". What I've tried to explain to you is that edit wars get nothing accomplished. You keep reverting and reverting, and then someone reverts you, and the cycle continues. Wikipedia articles aren't meant to go back-and-forth like that. The only real way you get something accomplished is by discussing it with other users, in the hopes that you can form a compromise, or consensus. To answer your numbered questions:
After we last spoke you continued to revert (, , , ). On Sason, you reverted 3 times in the last 24 hours. Even though you came close to breaking the three-revert rule (which you were blocked for on May 31), three reverts is not some sort of magic barrier that prevents you from being blocked. An admin could have easily blocked you for simply edit warring. This is the type of stuff that occurred on Armenian-Azeri pages for example before the arbitration case. After that many users were placed on editing restrictions, a lot of the problems were solved. Aggressive editing can be characterized as constant edit warring, and basically a method of getting your version of the article by constant reverting as opposed to discussion. Is is the exact opposite of what is outlined at WP:1RR. Even if you believe the information you are adding is NPOV, if it is contested by several users, the best thing is to discuss it with them, and once you have come to an agreement, to implement that version. 
I'm sure you've tried to be civil, but here I notice you referring to your opponents as """"vandals"""", this is inappropriate because as I explained above, you're involved in a content dispute here. If other users have personally attacked you, please show me links of this and I will warn them. It is never acceptable to do so.
Yes, it is possible. You can get mentored at Wikipedia:Adopt-a-User. Wiki-adoption was created back in 2006 as a program designed to help new and inexperienced users.
Although you may disagree with him, it is within Namsos' right to nominate an article for deletion if he believes it is non-notable. However, as you can see from the discussion at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Erich Feigl, it appears that many users there are deciding to keep the article, so I'm not sure that it matters anyways. Everything that you mention (awards, documentaries, books, Google hits, etc.) can be mentioned at the AfD (articles for deletion page). I have noticed that you've already made a comment there already. Make sure to keep an eye on that page, the discussion is typically open for five days.
I don't know the specifics about why your sources were removed, but if you feel like you're not getting anywhere with these disputes, you might try posting something at the Reliable Sources noticeboard if there is a dispute on whether your sources are valid or not. Another option is the new Ethnic and cultural conflicts noticeboard. Finally, after you have made all attempts at resolving the conflict (including those two links I gave you), and you still feel like nothing has been accomplished, you can check out formal mediation. There, a mediator will get involved and act as a third party.
I hope all that I have said is helpful. Please feel free to drop a note on my talk page if you have any further questions/comments. khoi """,0.0

Another reason perhaps wanting to limit amount of links on page - however 2 links is not excessive surely? Perhaps the most likely reason is that I posted the link myself for a website I own. Can it be verified who posted the link for derilicte.co.uk then. The users have blocked their details from inspection with Nominet so it could well be posted by a user who edits the RAF Rudloe Manor pages. If we discover who runs this site and they are on the Rudloe Manor page should this be deleted also?

Thank you Rklawton. User Verbal chose on another page """"crop circles"""" to delete my link to my website there also. However Verbal did not bother to check the other links, some of which link to conetnt which requires plugin software to be installed. This is discouraged by Wiki policy external links but for some reason Verbal chose to only take a keen interest in removing my link and not bothering checking anything else or doing any other work. I find this odd and Verbal has followed me on to this page to decry my links. The words Witch Hunt come to mind. Can you please explain what reasons you feel apply to why the links need to be removed? If it would make you happier I could easily provide another wesbite which is not owned by myself but uses my aerial photos of Rudloe Manor. AFter all derlicte does not have such aerial photography and only covers Site1 of the base. Pointing to the policy page does not address the many points I have made- re some users being able to post personal photos directly to Wiki but myself not even being allowed to make a link to photos. If I were to upload my photos of Rudloe Manor directly to Wiki how many miliseconds would it take before editors removed them, just because its me. 

I draw your attention to []  a """"gallery"""" of pictures, some of which are even classified """"unidentified"""" bird pictures and this is seen as perectly fine. I feel obligated to do this considering my own issues being looked into. I consider this type of gallery to be exactly the type of thing I would not be allowed to do!

Well, you have to admit, Hugh Jackman and the Wolverine character are much easier to sell to audiences than any of the other characters are/were. That's why we got a Wolverine movie and not a Cyclops movie, or a Rogue movie, or a Storm movie...or anyone else for that matter. 

Yeah, according to McG, J. Nolan wrote like the entire third act and he was pissed that the WGA didn't give him writing credit for it. 

Well, as they appear in more episodes I was being forced to realize that they are not """"recurring guests"""". Since the companions are seeing fit to include some real world info on them it was either create 4 new sections and develop them in the style of Oliver Queen...or, create a new page for all of them to exist and trim Oliver's section down to something like Clark's section and then create sections for the others that mirror that setup as well. The thing with Martha and Jonathan is that they aren't going to get any bigger. We still have season 9 ahead of his, and potentially season 10, which means potentially more appearances from these members as well as new ones. The only problem I forsee is that they have not greenlit a season 8 companion yet, because sales on season 7 weren't that great. But, as far as these specific characters go I should be just fine. I have a whole section in season 6 companion on their costumes (which I can probably scan that image and overlay it with their traditional comic book representations for a new gallery image).

Opie, your statement """"You don't honestly believe that the author of the golf tee book is making things up""""…. is foolish. Many books and authors present fraudulent and construed information. Some of these authors print information that is researched haphazardly and sometimes not researched at all.  This is why reputable authors research and verify the content they use with Agencies that hold the fact-based and documented information. You consistently use the book The Singular History of the Golf Tee by Irwin R. Valenta, along with the website “Scottish Golf History” as a fact-based source. Looking at the website alone I find an abundance of erroneous and inaccurate information and patents. One just for example, is the U.S. patent of Mr. Dalziel in 1896. This patent, is claimed on the site as a “golf tee,” but in actuality is a device to be used in a game of Tennis and has no relation or bearing on the game of golf.  See patent #567,455 This is just one of the flagrant inaccuracies that are included in the links and information you have provided.  Another example of a site that has inaccurate information is Pat Ryan Golf timeline. It states that the Bloxsom & Douglas patent originated in 1899. Whether these “inaccuracies” are intentional or not, it is the lack of due diligence of the authors and originators that seems to be the issue.  Once corrected information has been verified and deemed accurate, upon the notification to the necessary parties, the erroneous information should be removed.  If it is not, then one is lead to believe that the misinformation by the author or originator is intentional. 

All of the U.S. patents can be verified through the U.S. Patent office website. However, you say that the UK office has patents that are unsearchable through their website. It seems very suspicious that all of the patents that are quoted in the book seem to be “unavailable” through the UK patent office website for verification. """,0.0

“Neutral point of view is a fundamental Wikimedia principle and a cornerstone of Wikipedia. All Wikipedia articles and other encyclopedic content must be written from a neutral point of view (NPOV), representing fairly, and as far as possible without bias, all significant views that have been published by reliable sources. This is non-negotiable and expected of all articles, and of all article editors. For guidance on how to make an article conform to the neutral point of view, see the NPOV tutorial; for examples and explanations that illustrate key aspects of this policy, see Wikipedia:Neutral point of view/FAQ.” http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view

“Bias -NPOV requires views to be represented without bias. All editors and all sources have biases—what matters is how we combine them to create a neutral article. One can think of unbiased writing as the fair, analytical description of all relevant sides of a debate, including the mutual perspectives and the published evidence. When editorial bias toward one particular point of view can be detected, the article needs to be fixed.” http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view

“Neutrality disputes and handling - A common type of dispute is when an editor asserts that a fact is both verifiable and cited, and should therefore be included.  In these types of disputes, it is important to note that verifiability lives alongside neutrality, it does not override it. A matter that is both verifiable and supported by reliable sources might nonetheless be proposed to make a point or cited selectively; painted by words more favorably or negatively than is appropriate; made to look more important or more dubious than a neutral view would present; marginalized or given undue standing; described in slanted terms which favor or weaken it; or subject to other factors suggestive of bias.  Verifiability is only one content criterion. Neutral point of view is a core policy of Wikipedia, mandatory, non-negotiable, and to be followed in all articles. Concerns related to undue weight, non-neutral fact selection and wording, and advancing a personal view, are not addressed even slightly by asserting that the matter is verifiable and cited.

Hi Micky, 

Hey, not sure if my last message went out or not. My system sort of froze up for a bit and I could not log back on for a bit.

The gist of what I typed folows:

Not intending to be a smart aleck but the seal, as opposed to the coat of arms doesn't appear in color officially. I think Deb Markowitz, secreatary of stae for Vermont would back up that it is a single color device. I really do like the seal, it was deisgned by Ira Allen, and is refreshingly differnet from most others. Perhaps a trifle naïve in design but a nice device. It was designed to have dies cut for embossing so it is high contrast line art not showing shafiding or multiple colors.  

If you take a look at the staes of Maine, California, Michigan, you note more of a full color with shading and dpeth sort of treatment. these though labled """"seals"""" are all heraldically like a coat of arms. If we look at nations, like the Netherlands, UK, Canda, we see coats of arms. American civic heraldry is different. Vermont like many of our older east coast states has a coat of arms that is described by a statute, what can be called a blazon. Because vermont's coat of arms is so great I would love to see it used somewhere. Maybe as an illustration on the Vermont page, and as its own entry. If the word """"Seal"""" in the sidebar is boiler plate and can not be changed to coat of arms, could we use a solis dark green or medium gray without the color? And, possibly use the more colorful coat of arms, for the state links at botom of page. 

It's a thought. I grew up in Vermont. I see you are from Enlgand. What part? I am doing a signage and branding project in Sevenoaks, Kent at present.

From Wikipedia:Village pump:

How many images are too many? I've only ever seen one image. I wanted to add the famous picture of the soldier shot in the head to the Spanish Civil War page, as well as a typical propaganda poster of the times.
 0000 EDT 23 May 2002

IMO, a couple more legal images would be fine.  The article only has 1 image after all.   04:17 23 May 2003 (UTC)

I've recently brought over a lot of new content from the Spanish-language wikipedia. I've done my best to integrate it, but someone may want to take an editorial pass. Also, it seems to me that we ought to have several """"sidebar"""" articles dealing with things like the internal situations in Madrid and Barcelona during the war and there should probably be a lot on Spanish anarchism and the various plitical parties of the time that either exists and should be linked to, or doesn't and should be written.   09:02, 8 Jan 2004 (UTC)

Could someone please explain the communism vs civilization comment in the intro? Thanks. - , 2004-03-14t09:29z
 An atttribution would certainly be nice, and I didn't put it there, but it's certainly on the mark as to how some viewed it. I've seen Hearst Movietone newsreels from the period, and that is pretty much the picture they present. It's also the rhetoric to be found in Franco's speeches during the war. It had very little basis in reality, in my opinion, but leaned heavily on communist atheism and anitclericalism, and the destruction of churches (and  in some cases  torture, murder, etc. of clergy and members of monastic orders) that occurred in the opening weeks of the war. I think the article is accurate in saying that the atrocities in those opening weeks were roughly equal, but the fact that many on the Republican side targeted the Church was endlessly exploited in the Nationalists' rhetoric, and struck a note with conservatives elsewhere who otherwise might have kept more distance from fascism.   17:55, 14 Mar 2004 (UTC)

Pro-Nationalist link
I for one am inclined to keep, for the moment, the recently added Professor Marek Jan Chodakiewicz on The Spanish Civil War. There ought to be at least one external link to a site more sympathetic to the Nationalists than to the Republic. However, I don't think it is a particularly good site: there must be a far more comprehensive presentation of this case (maybe even with some decent footnotes and/or external references itself?) elsewhere on the web. If someone could find a better one and substitute it, I think that would be an improvement.   

 Not Neutral 
I added the note """"The neutrality of this article is disputed."""" because of the insistence in that General Franco or his forces were fascist. This is just communist propaganda. We know better now. Communists wanted to overthrow the legal system of liberties in Spain to create a system similar to that of the Soviet Union. General Franco and his coup prevented that. Of course, the Republican legality was not restored, but that was because it had not proven safe from revolutionary risks. And Monarchy was not restored probably because King Alfonso XIII fled the country only because his partisans lost a municipal ballot, so it appeared to the victors in the war that that king was not reliable to grant individual rights. Of course, Franco's Dictatorship is more than objectionable, but it does not prove that it was a fascist regime.

(this was unsigned, but it's User:Makjavelo

 Frankly, I think this one characterization does not make a non-neutral article. I disagree with much of what Makjavelo has just written, but I do agree with him that the article (or maybe an associated article) might gain from a more extensive explanation of the somewhat complicated relationship of Franco's politics (and Falangism in general) to fascism as such.   17:44, Jun 8, 2004 (UTC)

 This seems like petty apology for Franco, in my opinion. Not only the communists, but the anarchists, socialists and most Republicans refered to the Francoist forces as """"fascist;"""" as well as many historians and authors, e.g. Hemingway. I forget the exact quote, but a Christian clergyman (who were notoriously right-wing at the time, in popular belief) stated that Franco's regime was totalitarian, because he """"controls all aspects of one's life,"""" which can be argued because of the high degree",0.0

No, he disagreed with me on a substantive issue.  Another administrator blocked me punitively on a substantive issue (because that administrator supported the sources added to the article while I didn't) to prevent me from protesting the second rate, non-verifiable sources in an article.

"""

When I saw the edits and MPLX's addition yesterday, I found it rather anti-GWB (which I happen to share, but...) POV and unfounded. The connection seems absurdly weak and tenuous; for decades if not centuries politicians all the world over have been speaking of peace while waging or preparing war, and assuring the populace that it is a just war to bring a better tomorrow for everybody (in my country, we have rich experience with """"fighting for peace"""").
So, first of all, I don't think the speech was particularly paradoxical, let alone """"[[Orwellian]"""" - although I don't follow the US media; if MLPX can provide links of other commentators noting this, he has a case in point.
Secondly, even if the speech was meant to explicitly refer to FDR's Four Freedoms, I think that the mediated connection to 1984 is too loose and willed for an encyclopedia.
Thirdly and most importantly, even if the section had a place in the article, it's certainly not squat in the middle of the section """"The World of 1984"""". Move it down among late references, if it must be kept (and I agree with Alavery7 that it concerns more the speech than the novel so it should be better moved there).

I would perfer his work, than Sony's teaser picture:P

By the way, there will be 2 villains, Sand man & Venom. Harry as been comfirmed to be the next goblin (Hobgoblin).
So I am wondering, will Venom & Sand Man are to be in it, will Harry be in it? I am thinking Harry might appear in Spiderman 4

But Peter will meet a new girl in his life, """"Betty"""". It is said that someone close to Peter will die in this movie. And I am greatly sure it will be Betty, cuz it's official. Because in Spidy comics, She dies, and dies by the hands of Green Goblin. So Harry will have to be in this movie.

What about Venom? In Spidy cartoon, one the old one, it's kinda like modern, the cartoon that sometimes have 3D buildings. In that cartoon, Spidey had the venom custome before, then abandoned it, and the venom came to Eddy Brook. I am thinking, the ending of this movie, might be Peter leaving the Venom suit, and the suit meeting up with Eddy, then Venom will appear in Spiderman 4

Sorry, if this is a spoiler:P

Holy crap..

According to Merriam Webster, the etymology is """"Etymology:
    obsolete English handicap, a game in which forfeit money was held in a cap, from hand in cap"""", which obviously has nothing at all to do with being """"Handy with a cap"""" or even related to the disabled. Certain individuals may have a negative connotation with the use of the term, which happens merely due to the words close association with 1960's era community welfare practices, but that is an individuals choice to associate negativity with the word, not the words fault at all.

First off, you should not edit the list templates directly, as the bot will ignore any changes. Also, you cannot use vertical pipes anywhere in the syntax other than in separating the template name, the section name, and the reason, otherwise everything messes up. In place, use .

Rajput is the term or caste introduced much later in the Indian caste system. Everyone knows about that and their origin created by Brahmins from Agni, chandra and what not because in medieval India they were the rulers and it was the hour of need for Brahmins to bring them into varna system for protection and other reason where as Saini or Shoor sainis are ancient tribe and are Yaduvanshi kshatryas.

Even then it appears to be original research because the sources cited are not arguing against slavery on the basis of textual criticism, they are arguing against authenticity of these books of the Bible.

 Drug abuse 

""""Before I attempt to do a major revision on this article, I would like to get your opinion on the title. I notice that substance abuse redirects to drug addiction, so what is the current consensus for keeping drug abuse as a standalone article? It seems to me that drug abuse should redirect to substance abuse, and an attempt should be made to split substance abuse issues off of drug addiction. What do you think? If you disagree, in what direction do you want to see the drug abuse article go, and what topics do you think it should focus upon? I was thinking it could examine the scientific, poltical, and social aspects."""" -Viriditas

I believe the drug abuse article existed to coincide with the drug use article (which is a redirection to recreational drug use).  It could also be a matter of renaming articles to the most accepted NPOV term, and having appropriate redirects.

I agree that substance abuse is a more correct title for the article, but then such an article (substance abuse) should also include information on alcohol abuse, which currently has its own page as alcoholism.

The drug addiction page has some POV problems.  What should be done here is to leave 'drug addiction' itself under the domain of Addiction, and rename the drug addiction page (with all its references to brain chemistry, and method of action) to Drug dependence.  Anything addiction specific should be moved to the addiction page.

I'm more of an advocate of giving separate topics their own pages of proper NPOV naming (even if they are stub articles) as long as those pages are well linked into from relevant pages.

My vote would be to make substance abuse it's own page talking about substance abuse in general, and have it reference other pages talking about specifics of chronic abuse the different substances (i.e. alcoholism).  Specifics of problems with certain substances can have their own pages.  I'm certain that all the individual drug pages have plenty of information that can be moved off to specific abuse pages.

I'm certain that some will be opposed to separating the """"good and the bad"""" of different substances into regular pages and abuse pages (consider Alcohol > Alcoholic beverage > Alcoholism), but if alcohol is treated that way, then other substances deserve the same consideration.

If people disagree, then I'd argue that the alcoholism and alcoholic beverage pages should likewise be combined.   23:23, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)""",0.0

Some of these uploads are music, some are comedy, some are anti BNP/EDL. None are espousing a particular movement, political group or ideology. However, due to the fact that I espouse equality and fairness & am opposed to unwarranted victimisation, oppression of minorities, hatred and ignorance it seems that certain users like to think of it as a soapbox to spew their racist, misogynistic, homophobic, xenophobic and hate-filled gibberish....the BNPers, of course, are guilty of all the aforementioned.

Apparently my decision not to allow comments that are basically spam, lazy insults, illiterate ramblings and screeching from morons who don't listen (but just use the channel as their own forum) means I am anti free speech. I don't think our ancestors fought against fascism and for the right for freedom of speech to have hate-filled knuckle draggers abuse that by screeching hate-filled drivel bereft of facts, decency or, indeed, a point.

I do actively encourage freedom of speech for all, quite often letting idiots speak makes them look far more idiotic than I ever could hope. There is a difference between debate and spamming, insulting, not listening and preaching though.

I'm happy to debate, but a debate consists of two sides discussing their views, not one shouting and refusing to listen to anyone else. It is my channel and I have the right not to allow trolls, clones, neo Nazis, racists, haters and all round ne'er do wells the right to puke bile all over it....this is not suppression of freedom of speech and if anyone cares to look back through my channel they will see I actively encourage debate, but also see how so many choose to eschew debate in favour of: 1. Attempting to belittle, hurl abuse and calling me UAF/Marxist/far left/rapist/paedophile with absolutely no basis (libelous in reality). 2. Personal insults, accusing me of being a foreigner, bringing my family into it (they love a """"mum"""" insult) and accusing me of being several users because they can't believe more than one person can disagree. 3. Misquoting, paraphrasing and cherry picking """"research"""" from questionable sources and only ever """"research"""" or accept sources that back up their own beliefs. 4. Lying, accusing me of acts I haven't done and claiming they have """"won"""" the argument when they have ignored the points I raised and just harped on and on. 5. Cloning my account on here and also using my username on far right forums. They have cloned me numerous times. 6. Waffling on about being deprived of freedom of speech (to make insults and allow no right to reply by blocking me from their channels)

Basically, these goons make up a tiny minority of incredibly arrogant, ignorant, spiteful, indecent, amoral, borderline illiterate joy sappers; BNP, EDL, neo Nazis, Islamophobes, extremists, KKK, you name it. THEY are what is wrong with the world and they are what is trying to stop us evolving; their motivation is hatred and ignorance....proven by their labelling of everyone who disagrees with them as communists, UAF, Marxists and Liberals (and more unbelievably fascists?!?) with no basis. Of course, they are just lazy epithets to group the majority into one category when their opposition is made up of a multitude of individuals from left to right, of different coloured skin and beliefs, sexualities, classes, background etc....the majority basically.

Youtube grants these guttersnipes the anonymity to parade their ignorance and disgusting ideals and appear to be a larger group than they are. They are fooling themselves though, they will always be a minority of failures who blame their own failure in life on everyone but themselves. Ironically, our ancestors who fought for every freedom they treasure now are having it spat back in their face with every ill informed, erroneous, indecent and anti educational rant these idiots post.

I'm keen to give RFA another go, but be honest, how long do you think I should wait, and what else do you think I need to do/iron out/resolve before I give RFA another go, because I wouldn't want to run unless I've a rather good chance of passing.

"Polemics, rehashing old claims, fighting over perceived biases and trying to blame each other for whatever will not solve this problem. I perceive that the fundamental premise of the dominant editors holds that any critique of the prevalent analysis in this article must begin and end within the terms set by the proponents of that analysis. This is not logical. To elucidate and support an alternative proposition is not bound by any other disciplines a priori, asserted or even purported evidentiary claims to knowledge. Historical-critical biblical theologians have no automatic nor exclusive claim to authority in this matter. Neutrality in this instance is clear. The article must provide context to the reader about the question, show the various positions and approaches taken in different fields, and ensure that no single claim to exclusive authority or evocation of essentially meaningless and conflictual universal generalisations is present. It can not possibly be any clearer. The article is fundamentally flawed in two ways 1)claims to exclusive authority and 2) circular and self-referential evidentiary support. If we welcome a diversity of perspectives, educate the reader, and all show more respect and dignity to each other we will surely end up with one heck of a great article. What do you think?",0.0

Low velocities
The article says """"Aerodynamic heating is not a factor at subsonic speeds"""", but it is present isn't it? As T_amb*(gamma-1)/2 * M^2 is continous, then heating is taking place at all speeds, and whether it is significant depends on what is being considered. For example, Mach 0.5 in air at 20 deg C gives a temperature rise of close to 15 deg C.

", as I promised here is a brief discussion of the different types of distillation used in the hydrocarbon processing industries that I am very familiar with ... i.e.,  oil refineries, petrochemical plants, natural gas processing plants (extracting natural gas liquids known as NGL's), and other hydrocarbon processing industries. Those industries probably have perhaps 80% or more of the industrial distillation columns in existence.

Other industries such as the pharmaceutical industry, the alcohol distilling industry and the fine chemicals industry also use quite a bit of distillation, but I am not familiar with those industries.

Major Industrial Distillation Types: The two primary types of industrial distillations are Continuous Fractionation or (Continuous Distillation) and Batch Distillation. The industrial Continuous Fractionation distillation towers are typified by the large, vertical, cylindrical columns as can be seen in the oil refinery photograph in the Fractional distillation article. Please note  that by continuous, I mean 24 hours a day for 1 to 3 years before being temporarily shut down for maintenance ... and we are talking about towers with diameters ranging from about 65 centimeters to 6 meters and heights ranging from about 6 meters to 60 meters or more.

There are many subsets of the Continuous Fractionation primary distillation type, such as: 

 Fractional distillation
 Vacuum distillation
 Azeotropic distillation 
 Extractive distillation
 Steam distillation

The above subsets would be of approximately the same size range is the primary Continuous Fractionation towers. The vacuum towers require reinforcement (provided by a number of steel beams encircling the tower exteriors) so that they can withstand the difference in pressure between the exterior atmospheric pressure and the interior vacuum. 

As for the vapor-liquid contacting trays or plates used in industrial distillation towers, it is virtually impossible to explain bubble-cap or valve trays (or sheet steel structural packing) without drawings or photographs.  We need someone who could make such drawings. We also need someone who can make a drawing of a typical kettle-type reboiler commonly used as the heat input to a  distillation tower (although there are other types of reboilers such as fired furnaces, horizontal or vertical heat exchangers, bayonet heat exchangers, etc.).

Finally, if you look at the the simple sketch that I made of a typical fractionation tower overhead system in the Fractional distillation article, that sketch needs to be made longer so that it shows the feedstream  entry (at about the center height of the tower), and the bottoms exiting the tower and entering the kettle reboiler .... with the final liquid bottoms product leaving the kettle reboiler and the reboiled vapor returning from the kettle to the tower. -",0.0

Really? Puny pictures in which you can almost not see what her eye color is. You need a magnifying glass to see her eyes. Don't show such pictures cuz it just looks really sloppy and desperate, which in your case makes sense. 1(By magnifying this image up to 400%, you can clearly see her eye color looks sort of olive green, not anywhere close to brown). 2(What the f*** is this? It look horrendous. Oh and her eyes are lighter than her hair and you keep saying they're the same shade, when clearly they're not. Lets take a look at a better quality image. No brown eyes here.)

3(These eyes can still be called hazel.) 4(Hazel eyes due to their nature have the tendency to look goldish brown in certain lights, and look at Belle's hair it looks red). 5(I can clearly see her eyes are not the same as her hair, in fact take a close look when a lock of hair falls in front of her right eyes and clashes with her eyes color. The difference looks brown and hazel, instead of brown and light brown.) 6(That's not a screenshot, and by magnifying the image, her eyes look dark hazel and so not the same color as her hair) 7(400% zoom in, hazel eyes) 8(What a desperate image, you can barely see anything, 1000% zoom in and her eyes appear not to be brown again). 9(400% zoom in, hazel eyes... again)

Oh yes, the Belle merchandise that has her with brown eyes is so big, only one of the pictures you send can sort of qualify. 10 (By magnifying the image up to 400%, you can clearly see her eyes look green-like). 11(400% zoom in, hazel eyes AGAIN)

JESUS F***ING CHRIST. You preseted me with like 18 images and almost all of them have Belle with hazel eyes instead of brown. ARE YOU COLORBLIND? Don't you know how to differentiate colors. An you call this SOLID? If Belle's eyes are hazel, than those are indeed solid, verified evidence. And the screenshots aren't even from the Diamond Edition, they're from the Special Edition.

Take a look at these pics, please. Think anyone will believe you that her eyes are brown? I don't think so. These are just a couple of additions to the pictures you presented, further cementing that Belle has hazel eyes instead of brown. Since hazel is a mix of brown and green and that hazel eyes vary between almost green to almost brown, on what bases are people suppose to believe Belle's eyes are brown?

I do feel that Jews are screwing up the planet (though admittedly Muslims, by far, surpass the Jews in their capacity to destroy things). Look at history. Only recently has it become the norm to like Jews. That only came about after certain countries (eg America) adopted them as the collective dame-in-distress needing shelter and protection. Sort of the precursor to the chihuahua. Before then, Jews were hated in Europe and America alike..And everywhere else. We all know Jews were once banished from most culturally superior European countries. The only reason why Poland took them in was that they had loads of money. Probably the same reason why Washington panders to the now. Point is, alot of people dislike Jews. I'm entitled to, so long as I don't demonstrate that dislike on articles dealing with the topic of Jews. We don't penalize people for not liking things, do we? His Excellency...

I really think that you did a great job with this page. There is a large emphasis on application throughout the wiki which has its strengths given the audience. I do think that there are a fe sentence structure issues and some material that would be nice to add. You are the expert in this  stuff so please take my advice, with respect to the content, with a grain of salt.

Introduction
I like the points that you address, as far as versatility and challenges in design. One thing that I think needs a little work is the sentence structure. I noticed that the opening sentence is a hard to read. There is a lot of good stuff in it, but I think that it could be broken up a little bit. I think that the first sentence can be broken up into three different sentences addressing the purpose and challenges in application and decomposition. As it reads it is just a little hard to follow. Also the term breakdown is used several times, and I was wondering if the term decomposition could be used interchangeably. Overall I think that the intro hits all the areas that it should, and the content is good. I do think that it need a little restructuring though.

History
I really found the history of these polymers to be interesting. I think your decision to make history a section was a good choice given the natural quality of a lot of these polymers. One thing that I did not like about the history section in the opening two sentences. I understand what you are trying to say, but I think there may be better ways to say that biodegradable polymers have a been around for a while. If you remove the two sentences I think it would be more fluid. I really like how you covered a large timespan. It is easy to get wrapped up in what is cutting edge, but I think you did a really good job covering as much time as possible and pointing out many things. Nice! 

Structure and properties
This section was really nice. I really like the scheme that you have in the beginning. One nit picky thing I want to point out, is that think that there is a repeat in the first sentence of ester and ester bonds. Also in the first sentence you mention that some of polymers, such as proteins, contain amide bonds.  I think a nice addition to the scheme next to biopolyesters would be biopolyamides and a following box labelled peptides. I notices that you mention it in the next section and it may be a good place to show it in your scheme. I really like the properties section of your article, you address a lot of challenges with respect to degradation.  Another nit picky thing, I think the term impractical  in the third sentence could be changed to something more science like. 

Synthesis
This is section is great. I printed the article off to read it and as I was reading I thought """"They should really include a scheme for polyurethanes."""" and wah la! On the next page at the top there is a scheme for polyurethanes, so what I am trying to say is good placement. 

Mechanism of Breakdown
Another great section. One thing I think you both need to decide on is whether you are going to use the term breakdown, degradation, or decomposition. I see them all throughout, I am not sure which one is more right, but I think that you should agree on one and use it throughout. In the second paragraph there seems to be an error in your wiki language. There is the word oxygen that looks like this: [[oxygen[[. In the paragraph following your scheme, there is a sentence explaining the challenges for enzymes to evolve to accommodate the synthetic polymers. I there really like it and I think it is full of information. Although, I think that this sentence is crucial, I also think that it could be worded better. In this same paragraph there is a sentence that starts with:""""Typically, after physical processes......"""" There seems to be some extra words and the sentence does not quite make sense. 

Applications 
Application section is really nice. I think that medicinal application for these is really interesting and I also think that most people will find this intriguing. I think your section is weighted toward medicinal applications, and I think that is awesome. Now the stuff I thought that could be changed: I think that the first sentence of the second paragraph could be removed completely and the paragraph would be fine. In the third paragraph there is a sentence where you use the term in vitro twice. I think that second usage could be removed. Also, I got a little confused in the example sentence about rat smooth muscle tissue. I really like the term """"holy grail"""", not sure if this was intended to be a monty python reference, but it should of been. Although, I like the term holy grail, I think from a professional stance there may be other terms you could use.

 Tasmania at Conservapedia, a bit of a laugh.

NotARealWord said, quote """"What do you mean? The statement about their """"100% clean award"""" is cited."""" Are you for real, or you want to insult my/users’ intelligence? What, you have another set of policies about reliable sources and self promotion means? WHO MADE THAT STATEMENT ABOUT 100% CLEAN AWARD? Can you answer me SAREKofVULCAN? My feeling is that the guy from Softpedia entered that...what a reliable source. Secondly, what does it means """"100% clean AWARED""""? Is this “award” given by a reliable, verifiable source/body/entity, maybe Golden Globes? NO, that comes from the same """"reliable source"""", softpedia. And 3r, THIS IS PROOF THAT AMOUNG this team of editors that are against me, are some like (NotARealWord) which is (SAREK here is another personal attack according to your definition) or in a hurry to close my mouth, or just incompetent. 

Here is my proof;  NotARealWord said """"the statement about their """"100% clean award"""" is cited"""". 

And read what is on the page (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softpedia)now: """"programs which are also freeware or open source are given Softpedia's """"100% Free"""" award.[4][non-primary source needed]""""

Where is your non-primary source SAREK and Wikipedia and David Biddulph (David added this """"fault pas"""" in NotARealWord's name)

Regarding the 2nd point that I did not insert a name of a reliable source, we debated that, I inserted more sources but none is for you guys (I will start to differentiate between you, editors, and Wikipedia, in my naiveté, I still want to believe that how you act is not actually Wikipedia's way to work) a reliable one.  

Conclusion: my belief is that (I cannot pinpoint) or/and there is a matter of incompetence from the editor's part, some Wikipedia/Softpedia interests or just a vendetta.

You should reference with links (or due diligence references including where and date it was published, volume and page number) what quotes are attributed to Hari or Steyn. Erroneous quotes attributed to a person, not backed up by references, could be interpreted as libelous, and should be avoided. http://www.ifex.org/en/content/view/full/61063/
Large quotes attributed to Hari will be deleted as this is a post about Steyn, not about any single critic. 

The following was deleted:

According to Hari, in November 2001, Steyn circulated a series of conspiracy theories that a huge number of Muslims in New York City had been forwarned of the terror attacks. A Muslim student at a Brooklyn high school, he claims, said to his teacher on 6 September 2001: """"See those two buildings? They won't be standing there next week."""" 

On 10 September 2001, Steyn further claimed, """"a sixth-grade 
[NOTE: HOW COULD STEYN HAVE CLAIMED THIS ON 10 SEPT 2001? THIS STATEMENT MUST BE TOTALLY FALSE.]
student of Middle Eastern origin at a Jersey City school warned his teacher to stay away from Lower Manhattan because """"something bad was going to happen"""". Teachers at schools within sight of the World Trade Center in New York reported that, as the towers burned, many Muslim students were taking pictures: it seemed odd that so many of them happened to have brought their cameras to school on that particular day.""""

""""Almost no evidence has been offered in support of [this] claim. Steyn cites only the """"evidence"""" of a disgraced and sacked journalist on a suburban New York paper, and even that is for just one of several """"facts"""" that he cites. [...] Steyn seems to believe seriously that many American Muslims knew about the plan and did not warn anybody - not even the 300-plus Muslims who were murdered in the attack... """"

Steyn himself wrote:

In The River War (1899), Winston Churchill's account of the Sudanese campaign, there's a memorable passage which I reproduce here while I'm still able to: 
""""How dreadful are the curses which Mohammedanism lays on its votaries! Besides the fanatical frenzy, which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog, there is this fearful fatalistic apathy. Improvident habits, slovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish methods of commerce, and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the Prophet rule or live. A degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement; the next of its dignity and sanctity. The fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property - either as a child, a wife, or a concubine - must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased to be a great power among men.

""""Individual Moslems may show splendid qualities. Thousands become the brave and loyal soldiers of the Queen: all know how to die. But the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it. No stronger retrograde force exists in the world. Far from being moribund, Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytising faith. It has already spread throughout Central Africa, raising fearless warriors at every step; and were it not that Christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science - the science against which it had vainly struggled - the civilisation of modern Europe might fall, as fell the civilisation of ancient Rome.""""

Is that grossly offensive to Muslims? Almost certainly. Is it also a rather shrewd and pertinent analysis by one of Britain's most eminent leaders? I think so.""",0.0

"Thanks for the suggestion. I slept it over and hope that you are feeling more up to answering my questions about the edit in question. Specificaly: 

has the community not gotten smaller? 
was it not caused by the automobile? 
have I not sourced the statement as asked? 
is it not a fact? 
is it not information? 
does it not help inform people as to why foresters falls is not as large as it seemingly once was? 
is it not the only peice of information in the article that bridges the span of time between 1870 and present? 
is the usfullness of the edit the only criteria used to determine if it will be reverted or not?

All that I'm asking is for you to explain why it is better to not have the statement than to have it. As far as I knew wikipedia is intended to contain the sum of all human knowledge. As someone who lives near Foresters Falls I find that this information answers a pertinant question left open by the article (Why is foresters falls so small if it once had lumber mills and such?) I know that you said you don't want to continue this dialogue but I hope that you can understand that my frustration comes from the fact that you have, so far, not explained yourself. from my point of view it seems that you made the edit on a whim and refuse to acknowledge the possibility that it may have been a bit unwarranted. I found the information in a book on local history, I have listed the book as a source as asked. What additional criteria need to be met? please tell me. If I were to refrase the sentance? Would that be better? In fact if you could tell me what criteria was used to determine that it should be removed that would be fine. Because I'm sure that this sentance is no worse (certainly not because it doesn't detract from the page in the first place) than any other statement on any other page. Why insist on the removal of this perfectly sensible statement? Just because? Please answer this letter. Please do not throw another stock statement at me. Please do not respond to one statement I made in this letter and ignore any points you don't care to address. I would like you to meet me point for point and justify your actions. Please don't block me for daring to question administrators.

"""A few ideas to balance the US centric style.

Whilst you have brought in large area of British (mainly English and Welsh) facts neverthe less the opening paragraphs are somewhat US based.  I have no knowledge whatsoever on anything other than the UK perspective (though as this contributes significantly to US law, it will at least set some history.  

I am also a little bit concerned at why juries were created in the first place, you state that this is because they are believed to be free from bribery. Historically, trial by jury arose because of the difficulties of securing trial by ordeal, due to a change in church law.  By that time juries already sat to decide if there was a primae facie case to answer (the modern equivalent being Grand Juries).

The history of trial by jury (in England and hence the US) is related to several important events, most notebly the Assizes of Clarendon, the Fourth Lantern Council and the Magna Carta.

It may be useful for you to have a look at some of the wikipedia sites listed below:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_by_ordeal

""""In the Assize of Clarendon, enacted in 1166 and the first great legislative act in the reign of the English Angevin King Henry II, the law of the land required that: """"anyone, who shall be found, on the oath of the aforesaid [a jury], to be accused or notoriously suspect of having been a robber or murderer or thief, or a receiver of them ... be taken and put to the ordeal of water.""""

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Lateran_Council

Canons 14-18. Rules on the conduct of the clergy including against such things as: non-celibate living, drunkenness, frequenting taverns, hunting, conducting trials by ordeal or combat 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magna_Carta

Though you may be best considering the uk statute site which says:
http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1517519

""""NO Freeman shall be taken or imprisoned, or be disseised of his Freehold, or Liberties, or free Customs, or be outlawed, or exiled, or any other wise destroyed; nor will We not pass upon him, nor [X5 condemn him,] but by lawful judgment of his Peers, or by the Law of the Land.""""

"""The Loeb edition bears the inside title (after the 50pp of introductory material) """"Ammiani Marcellini Rerum Gestarum libri qui supersunt"""". (The volume titles are merely """"Ammianus Marcellinus"""", although they include no other work by him, since none has survived.) This inside title translates as """"The books that survive of the Deeds/Acts/History of Ammian Marcellinus"""". Nowhere have I been able to find where this Latin """"title"""" comes from; I can't remember reading or hearing anyone actually refer to AM's History as """"Res Gestae"""", although that's a Latin phrase that can be translated history.

The """"Divi Augustae"""" (sic), on the other hand, is a much clearer mistake; which should have been — so to speak — """"Divi Augusti"""", although FWIW (not very much) one can find """"RG Divi Augustae"""" online. Still, it's not right, and anyhow RGDA always refers to the piece of Augustan propaganda.

 Very serious stuff 

Sherlock Holms, and his sidekick Watson, are out camping on a dark clear
moonless night.

In the middle of the night, Watson is suddenly, and perhaps even indignantly
awakened, by the famed detective, who says to him, """"Watson, look up at the
night sky, and tell me what you deduce?"""" To which Watson, rubbing his eyes
for a moment, responds, saying, """"Well, let me see now. There are stars,
countless stars in the sky, and I can even see the Milky Way galaxy. And so,
if those stars that I can see clearly with the naked eye are themselves only
a small fraction of the total number of stars, then by logical deduction
there may be and likely are countless more that I cannot see. Now, if only a
small percentage of those stars were to have planets, and of those, if only
a small portion would to contain solar systems like our own, and of all of
THOSE stars, even if only a small portion were to contain planets similar to
ours, which have the capability to house life, and THEN IF, of all THOSE
living planets encircling THOSE stars, there were some, which were able to
house intelligent life, then I would be forced to conclude by logical
inference, that there may be countless stars, around which circle planets
just like ours housing intelligent sentient life forms, perhaps not unlike
ourselves even, right here, and now.

Watson listened through this long winded diatribe with patience, and then
finally albowed Watson hard, and exclaimed,

try these important things and maybe you won't be such a sucker motherfucker:

1. Learn how to spell. If things remain as they are, everyone is bound to consider you to be the ignorant lame-brained cult member you are.

2. Revert your attacks on Van Tucky on the talk pages. You come off as a vicious, vile psychopath. If you ever set your cult defending ass in a court of law, the jury would see through your charade in heartbeat.

3. Stop playing good cop- bad cop with your fucking retarded Dahn hack Forestgarden

4. Accept all Korean language sources you stupid bitch!! How dare you try to stifle and censor articles in the name of your fucked up cult. Your Forestgarden bitch believes its within Wiki policy to include Korean language articles when reporting on favorable aspects of your bitch master. Why don't you include all the other more negative portrayals in the Korean language. Also, who said this Itsahappyday fuckhead deserves to translate any Korean? This should all be disputed, you fucking racist, neo-nazi reject?

5. Stop using the word cynical to describe your """"enemies."""" You come off even more retarded than your Ilchee bitch master. Your philosophical maturity is less than that of a first grader. The world is """"cynical."""" Those who don't believe in Dahn are """"cynical."""" I can't wait until South Park makes an episode about your bitch cult. 

6. Are you fucking insane? Korea is the center of the universe? Korea as a cultural hub? Korea the place where the next messiah appears? You Dahn people never cease to amaze when it comes to your thought processes. Korea is not what your Ilchee bitch believes it to be. Think about it retard- the fucking nation of Palau has more of a right to talk about religious heritage than the fucking hermit kingdom. How can you be so retarded, that you choose a Korean cult? If you chose a Chinese or Indian one, at least it would show you have some portion of a brain. Coming to Korea and joining a Korean cult with Korea-centric views is more retarded than travelling to Antartica in search of good coffee while visiting Columbia in search of ice and snow.

7. One more time: the philosophical underpinnings of your shit cult are so flimsy I must question your intelligence.

8. Nicola Cola...what kind of bitch ass name is that? what is wrong with you?

I wrote the paragraph quoting Lindley that Peter finds puzzling. Bayes' theorem can be expressed in the form

Posterior probability = Prior probability x Likelihood

If the prior is zero then so is the posterior, since zero times anything equals zero. A similar argument applies if the pror is 1. The likelihood is the part which mathematically models the information content of the data. In the case where the prior is zero it makes no difference what the likelihood is, since it just gets multiplied by zero to make zero. So by choosing a prior probability of zero (or one) you cut yourself off from the ability to take on board the informaton contained in the data. I hope this helps. 23:21, 19 September",0.0

 Hi there 

My block expired a few hours ago and I wanted to ask you if you had the chance to review the case. As I understand it I was blocked for WP:NPA after stating several times the editor Wee Curry Monster was making """"untrue statements"""" purposely misrepresenting my comments. Prior to that I addressed them as """"lies"""" but after I was advised not to do so (in the last ANI) I stopped. I see now that """"untrue statements"""" isn't acceptable either. Fair enough I shall not use the word """"lies"""" or """"untrue statements"""" again. Now this raises the obvious question: what should I do when this editor purposely makes a misrepresentation of comments/facts in a discussion? I can present the evidence for this editor doing so quite a number of times (I actually did at the last ANI). I'd have no problem in assuming good faith if it weren't for the fact that he never once either apologized or acknowledged having done so. What should I do as an editor when another editor behaves like this over and over again?
Also, if you have the time could you please drop by the talk page Talk:Falkland_Islands_sovereignty_dispute and the ANI report and tell me if you believe editors Wee and Kahastok are properly interpreting the discussion as to give them consensus to delete the whole section from the article? I know this is a lot of work, but I've seriously done everything in my power to address thess issues short of taking both editors to Arbcom which I really do not want to do. Regards.   """,0.0

Just my thoughts on itI doubt there is a definitive answer that would satisfy everyone, and doubt that it is worth he effort to try to clarify in any great detail.

In some cases it is probably appropriate, and actually used just like a surname (in a legitimate but different, broader sense than that used by our surname article, and including patronymics in Iceland or elsewhere) by the person.  That's probably especially true of radio personalities with an on-air name that is actually two given names but sounds like a given name and a last name (I've seen that happen quite often), and that happens with various other stage names and pen names that are derived from given names.  But as a general rule, no. Some like Ann-Margret make it clear by normally using a hyphen. The problem, of course, is that our articles, especially the stubs and sub-stubs, often do not have enough information to make it clear what is going on.  If it is """"Mary Lou""""  or something of the sort, common combinations of given names where the second one is much rarer as a surname, especially if it includes the actual surname in the article itself, it should clearly be under M in any category (the redirect which should be there, or a dummy one if needed because otherwise it would be a disambiguation page, could be categorized if the full name were desired in some categories, and when that is done a note on the article page is helpful).  But in between, there is a huge variety that you'll likely get some arguments about no matter how it is done.

A bigger problem is people with full names given in the article name yet indexed under just the first given name in all categories, and there are lots of them. Even worse are those Easter egg sortings under some nickname which doesn't even appear in the article's own name.  """,0.0

Here is part of the 1957 paper, """"The FORTRAN Automatic Coding System"""" by Backus, et al., this snippet on the FREQUENCY statment and its use in a compile-time Monte Carlo simulation of the run-time to optimise the code generated. Quoting ...
The fundamental unit of program is the basic block; a basic block is a stretch of program which has a single entry point and a single exit point. The purpose of section 4 is to prepare for section 5 a table of predecessors (PRED table) which enumerates the basic blocks and lists for every basic block each of the basic blocks which can be its immediate predecessor in flow, together with the absolute frequency of each such basic block link. This table is obtained by an actual """"execution"""" of the program in Monte-Carlo fashion, in which the outcome of conditional transfers arising out of IF-type statements and computed GO TO'S is determined by a random number generator suitably weighted according to whatever FREQUENCY statements have been provided.

The movements in any kata can be interpreted in many ways, from the obvious to very complex applications from apparently simple movements.

It only changed from a redirect to Mengü (dab page) to a redirect to the Japanese facial armour article (and I proposed simply reversing that redirect, which has been stable for about a year now).  So initially, someone thought it should redirect to the Mengü dab page as a simplified spelling.  Oddly, a user had already moved the article from Menpō to Mengu (Japanese facial armour) even though Mengu had not yet been created (even as a redirect).  That user has long since been blocked, so we can't ask him why he needlessly disambiguated it, but if he would have followed the usual protocol of using the most concise title necessary to be unambiguous, it would have obviated this whole discussion.  Do you know of anything else on en.WP that could actually be the WP:PRIMARYTOPIC of Mengu?  Without a specific primary topic concern, there is nothing to discuss.  (☎ Diskuss | ✍ Beiträge) """,0.0

"That's an excellent question.  Why would scientists in other professions urge scientific standards in fields other than their own?

It's simple.  Scientists do specialize, but the scientific method is applied to all branches of science.  Urging people to apply scientific methods to all branches of science is part of the overall objective of the scientific community.  

Similarly, if I were a journalist specializing in one beat, I'd nevertheless want to urge all would-be journalists to employ ethical standards of journalism in any other beat.

There may be some disciplines where the public has a strong interest in the subject, and a lot of ink appears on the subject, including some doubtful ink.  Scientists or journalists in unrelated fields would naturally feel the need to urge appropriate tools of science or journalism, so as to avoid the kind of mistakes that have plagued human civilizations since the dawn of recorded history.

Urging people to examine the evidence for (or against) some theory with a skeptical eye is simply sound advice, regardless of the subject.  The dissent is not against any theory.  The dissent is against sloppy methods for establishing which theories are viable, and how we can be so sure of what we claim to believe.",0.0

"This is about the Byzantium section, not the whole article, if you can get your mind around that idea, we are making progress. Again I repeat
No one is claiming: 
Byzantiums invented the symbol.
Byzantiums are the only ones to use the symbol.
Mehmet II and the Ottomans definately copied the flag.

So there is no need to drown the small section in repeated attempts to show that a turk at some point passed through a nation that had used the symbol at some point as a hopeless counter.

What is being claimed:

The flag of Byzantium, crescent moon and star was flying over Byzantium when as the Turks arrived to lay siege.
Byzantium was the first state to use the symbols as national state symbols.

The fact that symbol is old has nothing to do with the Byzantium theory. It is about how the Turks came to adopt the symbol, not who invented it.  It is already stated  above (please read this carefully, i will repeat) It is already stated that the symbol has ancient roots above the section on Byzantium.  What this article is about is not how the Byzantiums got the symbol unfortunately for your nationalism, but how the Byzantiums used this symbol and how it is highly plausible as THE ONLY STATE TO FIRST USE THE SYMBOLS AS NATIONAL SYMBOLS, the Turks borrowed the symbols. Whether the Turks traveled through Places Greeks also went through has no bearing as this section is clearly about how when Istanbul was sieged, the only side using the symbols were the Byzantiums.  This however is obviously criptic to you and I am sure you will repeat your line about how Turks traveled through Babylon as some bizarre hope that it is relevant under this specific Byzantium section.

Civility

Normally I would let comments such as you posted in Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/QStik Records (2nd nomination) pass without making an issue of them however judging from comments from other editors you seem to be making a habit of posting uncivil comments about other users.  There are a number of issues that I wish to raise with you firstly:
""""The editor in question who has recreated the article is well known to members of my local project for his self-promotion activities on the wiki""""What are these alledged 'self-promotion' activities - as I have no relationship with any of the bands or record labels or in fact any of the other articles I have edited
I replaced the article after I had provided what I considered reasonable justification that the article was notable - I still disagree with the rationale on why it was considered non-notable but am willing to accept that others have differing views (a view that you don't seem to take).
I also take offence that you have suggested that I be blocked """"issue the user a stern warning (and maybe find an admin who might consider a block for at least 72hrs)""""  which according to Wikipedia's guidelines on civility is a serious matter.

 I had to fight hard for it, but I don't believe I am being ganged up now. I am being taken seriously now and not insulted.
 It was your attitude towards me that did and still bothers me.
 I am NOT asking you to go to these editors and intervene at this point. It will only stir up antagonism, where now we have peace. Obviously, this is your decision. I'm just stating that it's not my wish.
 Will you please sign your comments, at least somewhere?
 You accused me of trolling, too, a word whose meaning I had to ask my 18 year old son. All I can say is, I believe you got what you deserved when you interfered in this whole thing. I know you're an adminstrator now, and it doesn't impress me.
 I can and do accuse you of [[pa[trolling.]] like a [[Nazi][storm trooper]].

Dear Bishonon

questions: 

Is there any excuse for how they treated me and other newcomers, or anyone that questions them?

I can't answer questions without any information in them, sorry. You'll have to link me to some of the posts from these users that you're complaining about. I'd appreciate diff links, but I realize you're new and may have trouble making them. But at least tell me the page, the date, and the time.

 I find this statement fascinating in light of your assertions (below). 
 You have obviously looked around on some of the article edits in question. Why didn't you look at anything else? If you knew where to look at edits on the Dem Party article, I would assume you would know where to look for our dialogues.
 You keep making accusations at me and then state that you know nothing about the situation. This is hilarious.

 concerning the Democratic Party (United States) article: Please be advised, though, that I can't undertake to comment in any depth at all on the content of the articles about American politics that I see you editing. I don't know much about the subject, and few of the names in the articles mean anything to me. That said, I expect I can recognize what you call """"how they treated you"""", """"ganging up"""", etc, if I see it. A sincere thank you for that (recognize ganging up).

 I wasn't asking for that exactly. But now that you mention it, if you don't know much about American politics I don't think you should be getting involved in my edits concerning American politics. The article reads, for the most part like a giant advertisement for the Democratic Party. It's improving now because I stood up to these...yes.. bullies.

 The editors have been making this article less biased due to my edits and my arguments
 See the differences in the article since I joined in this debate and edit war. Though, I guess you wouldn't understand any of the dsicussion.

Hehe I'm still blocked, so I had to reply here )  Jaranda, I just really want you to know that I wasn't stalking you or anything like that... I really wasn't trying to harass you.  It was lack of judgment on my part.  Perhaps I should've backed off... but I still think it was unfair.  I mean after the edit to... well, I can't remember the page, the one after Eric Gagne, I was warned by another user not to do what I was doing (even though I wasn't intentionally).  I went to respond to him, and I saw I was blocked.  I'm not saying that what I was doing was right, but I don't think I should've been blocked if I didn't do anything wrong after I was warned.  If I continued, then of course I would be blocked and I'd agree with that, but the way it was I don't think should've resulted in a block.

As far as becoming a future admin, I've pondered in the past if I'd be willing to go through that at some point in the future... and I'm really not sure if I'd want to.  It would be an honor if I were an admin, but that's a lot of responsibility and I'm not sure that I'm the right person for that.  And with my new philosophy (I explained it in my past post) I'd have to take more responsibility than, at this point of my editing career, I'm willing to take.  Much later in the future, I might change my opinion.  But I've gotten into several disputes in the past and I'm trying to change my entire philosophy to negate all the problems I've caused in the past.  Having been blocked for the first time ever, ironically during the time that my friend  was blocked, adminship isn't something that I'm going to even consider about considering about considering at this time.  But perhaps some mentoring would help me become a better editor, and I wouldn't mind any assistance should you wish to provide some for me, Jaranda.  Thank you very much.  ''''''(talk) """,0.0

As the nominator, I want to thank you for taking the time to do an in-depth review of the article.  I was guilty of sinking in unsigned responses to some of your comments in order to communicate progress.  The article was renominated in September after three intensive days of full time effort to address all of the concerns from the prior GA review (which was summarily rejected without any interaction.)  I thought that a featured article should certainly meet GA criteria and we designated the article as the August 2010 Wikiproject Universities collaboration of the month.  The result was an improved article including many new footnotes, mostly to source the fact that the notable alumni actually attended Cornell. To give the collaboration a valid end point I nominated the article for GA, and renominated it after addressing the listed concerns, not aware of the defects that you uncovered.  Because the GA queue is months long, there was a peer review between the second GA nomination and your review, although that review ended up mostly focusing on images.

Notability of Cecilia alexander
 A tag has been placed on Cecilia alexander requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a real person, organization (band, club, company, etc.), or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.  renjc """,0.0

It so happens that I handle my own research and if Wikipedia says this or that, I confirm it in some legitimate source because it has been my experience that there are usually some fence sitters who climb up and occupy a postion they feel is important and swat down any newcomers, howere talented or correct they may be.  this happens all too often on various sites and is quite common.  Wikipedia is no different and should you care to show me how it has effective controls to prevent some know-it-all or other from controlling 'the board' as it were, I'd be happy to listen.

I've got to tell you that I truly appreciate you voting in favor of keeping the Maddison Gabriel page I created even with the not so nice messages that I wrote on your talk page. This is a nice gesture from your side. One of the reasons why I hate having pages I created deleted (especially the """"speedy-deletion"""" thing that appears almost automatically seconds after a page has been created) is this: most of those page can be improved through time. I think it's a shame having some work destroyed so a person has to start again all the way from the beginning to revive the page. Anyway... That probably sums my thoughts and opinions better than the angry messages I left you since a year and a half. Again, thanks for that help   14:29""",0.0

The simple criteria for terrorism generally seem to be intimidation or destruction of property in order to change public policy or public opinion while a state of war has not yet been declared. Some users would rather use recent acts of terrorism as a yardstick, rather than using a firm definition, and hence lose their ability to discuss matters calmly.

It was an explanation of my perception at the time, and not some type of value judgment. But if you really want an answer to your question, I'd say an editor is no longer a newbie when they have a reasonable command of how Wikipedia works, such that they do not make false accusations of copyright infringement, make a point of communicating with image uploaders, and familiarize themselves with the right way to communicate with members of the community.

More or less """"have you done the research for me?""""  I worry that these tools have rapidity, yes, but might not make it any easier to judge the recent history of edits.  Thus they can miss that the preceding series of edits might be bad, as they focus on just the latest edit or the latest editor.  I've seen a number of times where simply reverting the latest most obvious bad edit actually restores another vandal's bad edits.  Thus I slog along my watchlist checking recent histories manually.  Do any of the tools allow an adjustable 'window' of recent history, with the view to making it easier to find the better point to revert back to?

"It was not my intent to editorialize the article on Marcel Lefebvre, but I was trying to correct and add some information about him.  I did that because that article seemed to be slanted towards a pro-Lefebvre position as well.  I felt that it did not have enough information to give people the chance to make an accurate assessment about Lefebvre.  The two people who I called arch conservative were exactly that.  Both men tried to derail the Second Vatican Council, and fought both John XXIII and Paul VI and all those who were in favor of reform every step of the way.  I don't know if Thomas Jefferson actually said this or not, it was a quote the Jefferson character made in the movie 1776 that he felt that King George III was a tyrant even if they did not include call him a tyrant in the Declaration of Independance, so he thought they might as well call him a tyrant.  And I have talked to Catholics who were treated rather badly by church officals - especially in the times before the Second Vatican Council.  Why do you think that sexual abuse of children became such a crisis for the church?  It was because of a long standing church policy to protect the clergy at the expense of the laity.  I remember talking to an older gentleman whose grandfather left the church for a while, he didn't exactly what his grandfater's reasons were, but he said it probably wasn't hard to guess why.

Even if people were supressing the faults of the new mass, it appears to me that the pendelum swung the other way, that the article was stuffed full of criticism on the new mass, but anything on the benefits was totally removed from this article.  That's why I added the tag, because what I read gave me cause to believe that this article was slanted in one direction.

 Studia humanitates 

The Humane studies, According to Cicero:

Rationale for humane studies (letters)
""""Si ex his studiis delectatio sola peteretur, tamen, ut opinor, hanc animi remissionem humanissimam ac liberalissimam iudicaretis. Nam ceterae neque temporum sunt neque aetatum omnium neque locorum; at haec studia adulescentiam alunt, senectutem oblectant, res secundas ornant, adversis perfugium ac solacium praebent, delectant domi, non impediunt foris, pernoctant nobiscum, peregrinantur, rusticantur.""""""""Even if mere entertainment were our only objective in the study of literature, you would still, in my opinion, regard this pursuit as the most humanizing and liberating of intellectual activities. For no other pursuit is appropriate to all times, all ages, all situations; but this study nurtures our youth, delights our old age, brightens the good times, and provides a refuge and comfort in bad times; literature brings us pleasure at home, does not hamper us at work, and is the companion of our nights, our travels, our country retreats."""": Cicero, Pro Archia Archia Poeta 7.16):

Cicero speaks elsewhere, in his treatises De Officiis and De Republica, on the ethics of war, acknowledging that war is sometimes inevitable but that the first recourse in international conflict resolution should always be to negotiation rather than to violence, cum illud proprium sit hominis, hoc belvarum (""""since the one course of action is appropriate to humankind, the other to beasts,"""" De Off. 1.11.34). 

In the Middle Ages, law students studied rhetoric, or the art of persuasion, as an essential technique of their profession. In the Renaissance, however, beginning with Petrarch (c. 1310-1380) there was a movement to focus on the philosophical purpose of persuasion, which was to lead men to wisdom (virtue). The humanists looked to Cicero and other Latin authors as their guides, both stylistic and philosophical. Teachers of rhetoric, called dictatores, began also to write treatises on government. They also called into question more traditional Medieval educational programs, which had become a very theoretical and technical study devoted to the fine points of Aristotelean logic and syllogisms, and which featured incorrect and sloppy Latin.

The subjects of the studia humanitatis of classical tradition are: Poetry (see above); Rhetoric (developing a polished style), History (which teaches prudence, one of the most important political virtues), and ancient Moral and Political Philosophy. See Quentin Skinner, Visions of Politics, Vol. III: Renaissance Virtues (Cambridge University Press, [2002] 2007), p. 2.  The virtues essential for the citizens and leaders of a well ordered commonwealth comprise: Prudence, Fortitude (courage), Temperance, and Justice (to which Magnanimity, a Stoic, or Senecan virtue, was sometimes added). See Skinner, p. 96. The Heavenly virtues of Faith, Hope, and Charity were above, but did not supersede these. Rather they completed them. In the Renaissance it was thought that virtue rather than birth constituted true nobility.

Humanistic study of ancient texts used comparative analysis, and achieved great things. Comparing the style of one textual copy to another of the same work, for example, they could detect inconsistencies and error. Comparing texts of different authors, they learned to identify different styles and periods. The continued use of this form of analysis eventually (very slowly) led to a new way of viewing history as embodying to continuous change and development, of  languages, works of art and literature, as well as of institution. This kind of thinking gradually undermined the former view of humanity and its works as uniform and unchanging. It is not the same as experimental science, but it is a kind of thinking essential to any kind of rational knowledge.173.56.164.199  """,0.0

Is V blind?
The film makes several suggestions that V is blind and benefits from enhanced senses like Marvel's Daredevil. When he emerges from the fire, Delia says he looked at her, but not with eyes, as he had no eyes. Obviously he seems to have no eyes behind the mask, but the citizens wearing the mask throughout the film also have no visible eyes. This could be a screen behind the mask for style purposes, although shots of V putting on the mask show that it has no screen behind the eyes and mouth. V does seem to be wearing a skimask/hood behind his mask, though. In the scene where V is disguised as a police officer and kidnaps Evey, he is wearing a burn prostethic behind the ski-mask and if you look closely, he seems to have large blacked eyes, similar to Hellraiser Cenobites. In the scenes where V emerges from the burning ruins of Larkhill, the closeup of his face also reveals his eyes to be """"black"""". Also while in disguise later as Brookewood(or whatever), he is wearing a pair of shades. This could be for one of two reasons: To disguise his black/missing eyes, or to make rectal identification impossible. 

I believe V is either blind or has mutated pupils. It is possible that he sees in a sort of thermal or enhanced vision, lending to his quick reflexes and ability to predict movements in his enemies. 

I also think it is possible that his eyes are turned black for unspecified reasons, which is what Delia meant when """"there were no eyes"""". The blacking of the eyes in the various scenes also could have been an editing choice for scene enhancement reasons.

Failing to keep everything up-to-date
Hey Guys,
I seem to notice that we I'm absent, NOT all of the stats, season summaries for teams, etc. are staying up-to-date. Take for example Richmond, their season summary has not been update even since I been overseas in Europe. I mean that I feel stressful that I'm the only one updating Collingwood's season summary and nobody else. Also with season summaries, I want to discuss with all of you about how if we should have ALL of the season summaries in either a list or Template:AFLGameDetailed form (I might already dicuss this here).  Another problem is that Wikipedians has been updating articles in various formats in which it really annoys me when I update stats myself. e.g. With the Win/Loss table, I seem to notice that some Wikipedians have NOT bold the margin e.g. """"Port Adelaide 138"""" rather than the preferred format """"Port Adelaide 138"""". I notice that one lazy Wikipedian has decide to only update the Win/Loss table for their favorite team () rather that both teams ( and ). I mean the whole idea is to keep the article up-to-date, it is? Speaking about updating in various formats, I seem to notice the ladder progression gets messy and untidy all of the time. I means that we should discuss this problem together on this page and settle down on ONE simple format that all of us Wikipedians can follow. One Final thing I want to talk about in this is NOT changing/removing that already occurred in the past, I mainly notice that with the Win/Loss table were vandals keeping removing the bold text with home teams and sometimes with the Ladder were people make up they own stats. Its drives me insane and people must start looking at the Ladder on the offical website here in order to update the Ladder on Wikipedia. I hope that you fellow Wikipedians take me seriously on this issue as I am finding it stressful enough updating many stats myself.
Thank you for your attention.

Notability of Julia Olteanu
A tag has been placed on Julia Olteanu requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.  Excalibur!

Articles for deletion
Hi!  I noticed that you've been participating in the deletion discussions at WP:AFD.  Thanks; we can always use the help.  Since AfD isn't a vote but a discussion, your recent contributions haven't been as helpful as you might hope; in addition to a 'keep' or 'delete,' some information about why the article under discussion meets or doesn't meet Wikipedia's standards is needed.  You might find this essay to be an interesting source of advice about how to make your AfD contributions most helpful. - (talk · contribs) 
hmm i dont totally agree with you because why have a vote when the vote doesnt count. a vote should count in when a page is either deleted or the opposite.  
It isn't really a matter of agreeing or disagreeing.  Regardless of what you may think it should be, AfD is not a vote, and doesn't function as one; administrators reading the discussion to determine consensus just disregard any comments that don't include reasons that are based in Wikipedia policy.  You are welcome to continue participating in the way you are, but it is not a useful way to spend your time, since your contributions won't be used to determine whether an article should be deleted or not. - (talk · contribs)  —Preceding comment was added at

 Middle Bass Island 

Norman,

you have removed the link to the main Middle Bass Island web site several times. That means you don't even look at the contents of the items you remove, which is rather petty and incredibly arrogant.

The site started as a non-commercial site and contains a great deal of island history as well as many, many island pictures. It's one of the most popular sites in the Lake Erie Islands.

Please take a look at """"Site Map Page 1"""" and """"Site Map Page 2"""" before removing the link again. Saying that the hundreds of pages listed there have only commercial value is idiotic.

The site was started out of love for the Lake Erie Islands and Middle Bass Island and the fact that it now carries a number of ads for island businesses does not change the fact that it is mainly a site with island information not available anywhere else.

So what is your real rationale for deleting it again and again and again???

 RE: Apology, No worries 

I hope you didn't read my comment as rude, I certainly did not intend it as such, but simply a quick explanation for why I had removed your template, and reverted your changes. It is just that when an editor who has been established for many years finds a template threatening to block them on their page, it is not likely to get a good response. If my response was harsh, I apologize, but you should always check to see who you are templating if they are not an IP, and if they are established, it is always best to simply leave a note requesting more information, rather than a harsh template.

Dear Sniperz11, Thanks for your help, advice. We shall try our best to bring Brahmo upto acceptable wiki standards. Please keep checking that page every 2 days or so and post on the Talk page there. Actually there is a distinction between Brahmo(s) and Brahmo Samaj. Brahmos refers to adherents (members) of the Brahmo Religion whereas Brahmo Samaj refers to """"followers"""" of the Brahmo Samaj (qv. Hindu Code 1955). So whereas all Brahmos are Brahmo Samajis, the reverse is not necessarily true, and which is why Brahmo and Brahmo Samaj cannot be merged and in fact will differ at certain places. However, this has nothing to do with the BrahMos missile and I foresee a disambigunation page for Brahmos sometime in the future. Cheers.  

Dear Bikash,
We have to improve the content on the page. Add infoboxes, images, and citations. Then we have to check all those spelling and grammatical things. After that we have to find associated """"Brahmo type"""" pages and add links from those pages to this article so that interested people can start editing this page. Sniperz11 point about Brahmo and Brahmo Samaj (commonalities / differences) has to be brought out so the pages are not merged. Bikash please create a wiki user identity.  """,0.0

This is known as a """"cut-and-paste move"""", and it is undesirable because it splits the page history, which is legally required for attribution.

In most cases, once your account is four days old and has ten edits, you should be able to move an article yourself using the """"Move"""" tab at the top of the page (the tab may be hidden in a dropdown menu for you). This both preserves the page history intact and automatically creates a redirect from the old title to the new.

He or she has been manipulating Wikipedia rules as cover for what is clearly political censorship. User: AuburnPilot cannot even stand for Wikipedia readers to find out about factual material that upsets his political applecart through footnotes. Zero tolerance!

He claims of any source he politically dislikes, that it is either “spam” or a “blog” (or “POV,” another favorite dodge for those at Wikipedia seeking to censor those who fail to conform to their own POV), even though the one source is a previously published, classic magazine article otherwise unavailable on the Web (http://geocities.com/nstix/waronpolice.html), which the author has seen fit to publish on his Web site, and the other source is the longest, most thorough exposé yet published on the Duke rape hoax (http://vdare.com/stix/070113_duke.htm).

Note that I am not even talking about censoring writing within articles, since I hadn’t done any writing on the articles in question: Crystal Gail Mangum, Michael Nifong, 2006 Duke University lacrosse team scandal and Racial profiling.
I’ve been involved in edit wars before, though I have never been the aggressor, and have never initiated an elective edit war, though given the self-assurance that aggressors such as User: AuburnPilot exude, perhaps I ought to reconsider that position. It seems that aggressors rule here.

The reason I am making a formal complaint is that User: AuburnPilot has tonight upped the ante, threatening to have me banned
(http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:70.23.199.239&redirect;=no), if I do not surrender to his censorship. Should you find for me, please serve this individual with the wikiquivalent of a cease-and-desist order. Should you, however, find for the censor, please provide an Index of banned publications and a list of official wikicensors.

P.S. January 19, 2007 115A EST. Since beginning this complaint, I see that User: AuburnPilot has in fact succeeded at getting a crony, User: Physicq210, to block me, thus not only getting administrative support in censoring me, but preventing me from responding to his thuggery. (And no, I am not going to use cutesy, euphemistic language. If I were into such deception, I would have become a liar, er, lawyer, and would be worthless as an encyclopedist.) And I was unable to e-mail User: Physicq210 because I am not logged in and “You must be logged in and have a valid authenticated e-mail address in your preferences to send e-mail to other users.” (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Emailuser/Physicq210)

If this isn’t cyber-Stalinism, I don’t know what is! So, let me get this straight. Stalking and censoring an editor while using the equivalent of smiley faces (User: AuburnPilot’s penchant for saying “Thank you” after vandalizing one’s links) is “civil,” but complaining about such abuse counts as “spam, disruption, incivility, and personal attacks.” If that is verily so, then 2 + 2 = 5.

P.P.S The message here says that I was “temporarily blocked from editing Wikipedia as a result of your disruptive edits.” What the heck is that supposed to mean? For restoring footnotes and links that User: AuburnPilot had vandalized? If that constitutes “disruptive edits,” then you’ve utterly given up on honest English and all human decency.

 Condoning Bullying 

I have not really been around for weeks, indeed months, but I have been suffering regular harassment from Jbhunley, and you and others seem to be condoning his behaviour. It is never acceptable for someone to give another person unwanted attention for months on end.

 Many of the articles he nominates for deletion should be tagged, not deleted. Wikipedia needs improvement, not amputation.
 The number of my articles he has nominated is well up in double figures.
 He does not seem to read or research the articles he nominates properly.
 He does not have much or any knowledge about some of the thousands of articles he nominates.
 He seems to have no understanding that people have lives off Wikipedia. I cannot spend SIX HOURS dealing with one of his mistakes.

You seem to have little understanding of what """"personal abuse"""" is. Coming back after weeks, or even months, and finding someone is still trawling through my user history and leaving messages on my page - that is personal abuse.

The first question that is important for me is the accuracy of the first block about """"tendentious"""" edits in Macedonian Muslims. An administrator with particilar POV om Macedonian question, without warning blocked an editor (i.e. me) with a contrary POV.

The second problem is why some of the other administrators denied to look profoundly: The only caution by some other editor after my first blocking, until I stop my edits in the article is this - with a very """"substantial"""" argument: """"Stop wasting everybodys time!"""".

Please don't make excuses for yourself.  You cannot go on like this any longer.  You need to stop, and you need to stop today.  Reject this advice, and I worry that your sickness will probably only deepen and your addiction will waste whatever is left of your life.  Please stop.  It's over.  Enough.  Move on.  I do wish you the best and hope you will take this friendly advice seriously.  It will be the first and last time I share it, and I hope you know that I share it only with your best interests in mind.

Most of the world does not perform invasive testing on Great Apes, or allow it.m OTOH, I thought Crum375's revert was an excessive use of reversion when simply correcting the reference would have been adequate (and I further disagree that the reference does not support the statement),",0.0

Candidate for deletion
This seems like a serious article with some serious problems. The lead """"Pseudophilosophy is a term..."""" has no sourcing. The lead, and especially the first paragraphy of an article, is like a definition and therefore requires sourcing. The body of the article is sourced, but it's just a list of where """"pseudo-philosophy"""" has been used before, but does not justify the lead. I tried myself to quickly find some reliable source that would justify the lead, but couldn't find anything. The section """"Accusations against popular philosophers"""" should probably be removed the way it is now. Two of the entries are un-cited and the Rand citation is by a writer of unknown qualifications. Also, I can see this section degenerating into a """"philosophy I hate"""" list. The article seems to me, the way it is now, to be a candidate for deletion.   """,0.0

 Havana City vs. Havana City Province 

The source of that confusion is that Havana City Province includes Havana and other cities like Marianao, Santiago de las Vegas, San Miguel del Padron, Regla, Guanabacoa and so on, with their own city halls, institutions, history, etc. Now, it is true that the history, the economy and the social lives of those cities have a strong bond with Havana. For example, Santiago de las Vegas grew because of the importance of the tobacco plantations, Havana had (and still has) tobacco factories. Havana was the most important port of the Spanish Empire in America, and the cities around also enriched because of that fact. Havana's growth swallowed all those cities around, and nowadays they seem to be one and only city, but this is only apparent. Even nowadays, when someone who lives in Marianao borough or district crosses the Almendares River, which is the border, he/she always says """"I'm going to Havana to shop"""". Anyway, you can merge both articles, or write one article for Havana and do the same for the rest of the disctrics. By the way, the population of Havana City Province of 2.2 million people, are from the last census of 2002. In ten years, the population have grown, for sure.

"letter to you ==
This letter is intended as a kind of vaccine, an inoculation if you will, against the lies that permeate Amaury's jokes. The rest of this letter is focused exclusively on Amaury, not because I harbor any ill-will towards him but because he likes values that subordinate principles of fairness to less admirable criteria. Could there be a conflict of interest there? If you were to ask me, I'd say that to believe that his opinions represent the opinions of the majority—or even a plurality—is to deceive ourselves. I undeniably profess that he rewards those who show scrupulous adherence to his worldview and punishes those who make his adversarial contrivances understood, resisted, and made the object of deserved contempt by young and old alike. Deal with it.

If Amaury continues to hurt people's feelings, I will be obliged to do something about him. And you know me: I never neglect my obligations. If we can understand what has caused the current plague of vindictive despots, I believe that we can then help people see his bloody-minded epithets for what they are. Time cannot change Amaury's behavior. Time merely enlarges the field in which Amaury can, with ever-increasing intensity and thoroughness, take a condescending cheap shot at a person whom most arrogant sectarians will never be in a position to condescend to. He demands absolute and blind obedience from his encomiasts. If he didn't, they might question his orders to create a beachhead for organized warlordism. This unrelenting demand of obedience also implies that you don't need me to tell you that this is not wild speculation. This is not a conspiracy theory. This is documented fact.

This is not to say that Amaury seems to enjoy making unfounded statements and jumping to conclusions. It is merely to point out that Amaury exhibits an overweening sense of entitlement and a predilection for depreciating others. So don't feed me any phony baloney about how he has a duty to conceal the facts and lie to the rest of us, under oath if necessary, perjuring himself to help disseminate the True Faith of conspiracism. That's just not true. There is a format he should follow for his next literary endeavor. It involves a topic sentence and supporting facts. If hidebound grafters really believed in equality, they wouldn't control your bank account, your employment, your personal safety, and your mind. If you doubt this, just ask around. I'd like to end this letter with a message for Amaury. I'd like to say with emphasis and distinctness—not as a threat, but as a warning—that I will do whatever it takes to bring important information about Amaury's moonstruck, demented long-term goals into the limelight, and I won't let Amaury stop me from achieving that goal.

 Angel 

Well, yeah I'm a bit miffed to be honest. It's okay. Buffy Season Eight is a barrel of godly goodness, and by comparison Angel feels like Amazons Attack. Characterizations are off, I'm afraid. Connor's introduction felt ... crappy. Wesley's been introduced in the wrong way - don't jump him into a new role and backtrack characterization, do a Giles where you see him maybe two panels at a time and flesh him out through his own internal monologue. Lynch is a Spike fan, and he's projecting weird lusty desires onto Spike (vicariously?) - although Spike's not above the occasional Buffybot, it seems so strange. Strangest of all is Illyria. I would imagine she would either be desolate and destructive, walking about town killing without rest, or in some way secluded and shattered. For some reason it reminds me of Marvel vs. DC, where writers decided """"why introduce them cleverly? just have them start wailing on each other!"""" I also am trying my hardest to like Urru's style, but personally I think Jeanty and Lee are so much better, the slightly cartoony style better captures the tone of the series. Perhaps somebody like Nicola Scott would have been a better choice for Angel (by bizarre coincidence, going on her page after recommending her, she's done Illyria comics for IDW before!).

I'd say a good quality of the series is Betta George. I think 12 issues may be too long if this is the pace Lynch is going to have, and I'd have liked to see another writer try the Fight Night double-issue. I hate these publisher-exclusive contracts - I wish Geoff Johns or somebody could give it a go. I feel the book needs more pace, and better humour. Fix those two things and the other faults will fizzle away.~Talk to me! """,0.0

Does that diminish his statue as a thinker? Of course not; non-conformity with 21st-century sensibilities hardly matters in any assessment of an 18th-century thinker. As for the discussion of Voltaire's racism/anti-semitism we obviously must apply similar principles apply. Throwing in a few decontextualised quotes about Voltaire's view on Jews and black people to demonstrate that he was a raving racist is simply meaningless. If these issues are to be included in the entry at all (which I doubt they warrant), then surely they need contextualisation. For instance, Voltaire's discussion on Jews surely must be understood in the context of his general account of revealed religion, and must be set in the context of 18th-century censorship (which often led writers to attack the Jews whilst actually aiming at their Christian off-spring). Similarly, Voltaire's views on non-white people cannot be understood outside the context of his general framework of savagery, barbarism, civilisation and historical development. If people started to read Voltaire in such contexts, then they would start to understand that the question of whether Voltaire was a """"racist, anti-semitist, egalitarian, etc.""""? is pretty much meaningless and doesn't increase our understanding of him at all.

Inline citations are added with different sources and not just merely 'changing the sentence sequence' via single source. But if you find my edits not helpful then I will stop making any edits here in Wikipedia once and for all. I had the impression that Wikipedia is not a monopoly for senior editors. Also, I would like to respectfully apologize if my edits are """"un-English"""". Wish you two the best of luck. I appreciate both of your efforts to keep the articles encyclopedic as possible.

 In order for text not to be copyvio, it needs to be significantly different than the source, just adding a citation is not enough. As long as your edits are inline with all WP policies and guidelines, you are most welcome to edit. Yes the number of WP policies and guidelines can be overwhelming (even to experienced editors), but as a new editor, just be open to guidance from others.

 Removed long unsourced lists 

I have removed the long lists of unsourced expressions of Indian English.  This article is not the List of expressions of Indian English; rather, it is about the history, syntax, and phonology of the dialect.  Eight years ago, when I arrived on Wikipedia, books  Indian English were few and far between.  But now, as I have demonstrated above, a number of reliable studies exist.  

Random long lists, in any case, serve no purpose in an encyclopedia article.  Examples can be added judiciously in the relevant sections of an expanded Indian English article in order to illustrate notable (syntactical or lexical) features of the dialect.

I have repeatedly expressed the opinion that the most idiotic, as opposed to merely lazy, thing that Tyson has been revealed to have done was to listen to Bush's Biblical quotation and write a note to himself (which in the event he was too lazy to locate) to the effect, apparently, that Bush had clowned himself by taking credit for star names that were actually Arabic. So, since I wrote the words you complain about, it should be obvious that they are not intended to make Tyson seem in any way correct. I would be in favor of making this clearer by quoting someone to the effect that attributing to Isaiah the intent to take credit for star charts drawn up a millennia after Isaiah's death is profoundly stupid, but I was in a hurry to replace a vacancy on the page and an appropriate source didn't spring to mind.

The titles need not show that the characters are related, all about this is in the articles. You see, the nature of fiction is that it's not necessarily coherent. Since this article is not about Malcolm Wilkerson in the first episode of the show """"Malcolm in the Middle"""" but about the character throughout the show, it is indeed inaccurate to use a name for the character that was only used for the pilot episode. For the entire rest of the seven season run, the character's name was only """"Malcolm"""". This is not a question of beauty or taste, but of plain accuracy. A title like """"Malcolm (XXX)"""" my appear clumsy, but Wilkerson is not an alternative. In my opinion. If can't build consensus on this between the two of us, I suggest asking for additional input at Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions, since I didn't find anything in the guidelines for a specific case like this (although I'm fairly sure the fact that the character's name was """"Wilkerson"""" only during the first of 151 episodes of the show means that calling the character """"Wilkerson"""", esp. in the title, is inaccurate). —'''''' """,0.0

Continuous integration has a longer history than this article indicates.  Integration has been performed on software projects for a long time.  A number of the elements that are now seen as continuous integration were described by Booch. 

In the context of continuously integrating a system's architecture, establish a projects rhythm by driving to closure certain artifacts at regular intervals

He then goes on to say there are three parts to this:

First, the macro process of object-oriented development is one of """"continuous integration."""". Rather than set aside a period of formal testing at the end of the life-cycle, the object-orientated life cycle tends to integrate the parts of software (and possibly hardware) at more regular intervals...

Second, at regular intervals, the process of continuous integration yields executable releases that grow in functionality each release...

His final part is that by having integration more frequently quality can be assessed by management, risks can be identified and acted-upon early.

"""If Canada abolished the monarchy or changed the succession rules it would have no impact on the UK. Conversely, if the UK were to change its succession rules and Canada maintained the status quo, we would be faced with the possibility of having to completely change our system to accomodate a resident monarchy - when our political system and constitution are not designed for an absentee monarch (hence the position of governor general which does not exist in the UK). TAB 

The """"British monarchy"""" is """"first among equals"""" in political terms as the abolition of the monarchy in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, etc would have no impact on the monarchy in Britain whereas the abolition of the monarchy in the UK would almost certainly lead to its extinction in the rest of the Commonwealth Realms.

The fact is that the system in the """"Commonwealth Realms"""" (outside of the UK) was designed with the assumption that the monarch would be resident in London. Do you deny that?TAB

The fact is that the monarch is present most of the time in Britain. She has spent 2% of her reign in Canada and, I suspect, around that percentage or less in the other Commonwealth Realms.TAB

The fact is that this means there is quite a different relationship between the monarch and a) her British subjects and the British political system and b) her subjects and the political systems in the other Commonwealth realms.

The most obvious constitutional difference is that the duties and constitutional role played by the Governor General in the Commonwealth Realms is played by the Queen herself in Britain. i.e. The Queen, with increasingly rare exceptions, does not give royal assent to bills passed in Commonwealth legislatures or even give the Throne Speech (what in Britain is called the Queen's Speech because the Queen herself gives it). She does not name the Prime Ministers in Commonwealth Realms, does not resolve constitutional or parliamentary crises that may result in Commonwealth Realms and does not have weekly meetings with her Commonwealth PMs.TAB

Now monarchists like to believe that the Queen is fully informed and intimately involved in, let's say, Canadian affairs. The reality is that in the Commonwealth Realms the role of the monarchy has developed so that it is really more of an abstract and theoretical entity, much more so than in Britain.TAB

Let me give you a hard example. We now know that the Queen was not at all consulted on the dismissal of Gough Whitlam in Australia in 1975. This was done by Governor General Kerr in her name but she was not consulted or even informed until after it had happened.TAB

Let me give you another example. We now know thanks to the 30 year disclosure rule that the Prince Philip and the Prince of Wales quite regularly write letters and make phone calls to Cabinet ministers and senior bureaucrats in Britain complaining of this or that government policy (this is actually quite shocking considering all the propaganda we are fed about the monarchy being """"above politics""""). We also know from biographies and autobiographies that UK Prime Ministers do give some consideration to what the Queen thinks about this or that thing or even this or that minister. It may not be a decisive consideration but its in the picture. That is simply not the case for Commonwealth Realm PMs. There is no evidence of royals writing Canadian or Austrlain ministers complaining about this or that policy or of Canadian or Australian PMs being particularly concerned about what the Queen might think, at least not to the extent as is the case in the UK. TAB

Now you might say but the Governor General acts on HMs behalf so there's really no difference. But there is, the Queen's role in the UK is unmediated, in the realms it is mediated by a GG and she is almost a complete absentee from the process.TAB

Therefore, it's quite clear that her role is much more important in the UK than elsewhere. 

Also, the fact that the systems in the Commonwealth Realms are designed with an absentee monarch in mind and have a GG in place Britain becoming a republic would have an impact on the realms where Commonwealth realms becoming republics has had no impact on the Queen's role in the UK. 

The fact is if Britain became a republic the Commonwealth Realms would have to figure out which one of them would become the new home for the Windsors, or if some sort of shared custody arrangement should be worked out where, say, she spends one month in each realm.TAB

The fact is they would also have to deal with the royal family's wishes, including the possibility that they would not want to move to Canada or Australia but would prefer to either remain in a British republic as ordinary citizens or live in exile in Europe (or even the US). That would raise the possibility of abdication and having to find a new mon",0.0

You interpreted the text differently, but I don't recall a case where the information in the article text was at variance with the information in the book. TH1980's interpretation of the text was presumably similar to my own. Sometimes your interpretation of sources is rather unique, but if you just consider the basic question of whether the facts presented in the book match the facts presented in the article, then there was never really much of a problem. I think TH1980 and myself look at the sources in a more straightforward and conservative manner.
The reason why I know that TH1980 has access to the sources is because, firstly, he explicitly mentioned having access to Henshall and other sources during the good article review, and secondly, he himself has cited these books in the article.

"Hi
Hey Ebyabe... Look listen... I'm sorry about the way I acted towards you, BMK and MarntteD. I completely lost my temper there for a while, I came out of retirement and I realize now that retiring from the wiki won't solve my problems. I just couldn't understand that well about information I've been getting and that's why I lost my temper at that point, I came on the wiki 2 months ago because I want to make articles a lot better for everyone when they do research and I want to stop vandalism too that IP users put false information in articles. I still feel a little guilty for the way I acted towards you guys, and I want to let you, BMK and MarntteD know that I'm sorry, because I didn't mean to lose my temper. And I didn't mean for those things I said too. So please, I just want to bag from you, please don't report me at all, because I'm sorry.

Clearly, you have no idea what constitutes encyclopaedic quality.  Clearly, you just thought it would be fun to piss someone off.  Did you find it immensely fun?

Self-arrest refers to various maneuvers employed in mountaineering
It doesn't """"refer"""" to that; it is that.  You want to say """"Paris refers to the capital city of France"""" or """"Nile refers to a river that flows into the Mediterranean""""?

 This website is called wikipedia, not wikimanual.  But you never bothered to read WP:NOT, did you?

I'll have a think about this.  Some of it amounts to, hmm, not a basic civility, but an outright encouragement.  I'd like to take that up.  Sometimes, however, a citation formatting decline is due to fundamental errors.  I think a Comments with a lapse is better for the first type.  I'm still sticking with Decline for the second type.
A third case is 2c errors concealing 1c errors.  Often real 1c checking can't begin without appropriate citations.  Perhaps this is a subset of the second kind of problem, where citation formatting consistency causes a decline.
Jargon is harder.  Citations are a jargon driven field.  This is mostly where I'll be thinking about it.

no referrences to  Obstruction of justice huh? 
The article should clearly mention the great effort the Bush administration made of hiding all the evidence. This was the main embodyment of the attack. Obstruction of justice of this scale is a far bigger crime as murder.

 The precise definition of race is under dispute.. 

I wrote this to help spread understanding, please make sure to read the definitions of outcrossing on the link.

There is a lot of misunderstanding of genetics and further there is a lot of misinformation that people spread because they WANT you to think that there is no difference between peoples for a political or social agenda, that does not make it so. Humans share 98% of our genetic code with Chimpanzees, yet that 2% defines our differences and is important as is the difference in the human population, no matter how small the difference.

There are obviously differences in the expressed traits between Asian, African and Caucasian. These are different types of humans, if you choose to call the a race/breed or type it's up to you and it's immaterial. My argument has always been that racial diversity should be preserved which is a more neutral position rather than promoting that race mixing and interbreeding is somehow positive.

You and many people that listen to pop culture may think that by interbreeding you are helping humanity and there are lots of myths about how you will create better offspring; offspring that have the best of both parents. This is just a myth told by people who, are trying to say that people are equal, if different. Yes, people are people as Americans we believe that all people have certain inalienable rights but the best position for humanity is for each of the races to exist, separately to be the best we can. If you truly understand the advantages that diversity offers you will agree too.

I personally breed horses. And this is where I'll start telling you a story: the Thoroughbred horse started out as a mixed race horse. It was based on Arab stock and was bred only for speed for many generations, regardless of breed, the horse that ran the race the fastest was bred to other fast horses. The Thoroughbred breeding book is now closed, which means you cannot breed a Thoroughbred to any other breed, because, ANY cross you make outside of the gene pool will reduce the speed of the horse. This is called line breeding, please read this article as a basic """"learn to breed"""" guideline: http://www.learntobreed.com/linebreeding.html. Line breeding(inbreeding) is a useful technique as is outcrossing when advantagous to produce quality results, random mixing is like a child finger-painting and does nothing positive.

What Wikipedia has been proposing is that random interbreeding is potentially a good idea and should be treated as potentially positive. Any person who knows about breeding animals will disagree, it's very unlikely that race mixing will result in a positive result unless it was planned for by a geneticist. When you cited the plant hybridization, that's what you were doing citing a hybrid that was designed in a laboratory and there were not human beings or living animals as a result of a genetic mistake.

After all the times you have thwarted me... After all the times my plans for world domination were foiled by your meddlesome interference... After all the countless times you escaped at the very last moment, finally, I, Butros The Mighty, have defeated you, Crum375, Space Commander From Swalwell! 
How long I have awaited this glorious triumph! The Emperor Of The Universe has secured his dominion on this day! And now that my long struggle is over, how about a little... amusement?
With a clap of my jewel-bedecked hands, I summon the scantily clad dancing girls of my Pan-Galactic Slave-Harem. 
I have destroyed your accursed vessel, Star Of Abuse III, and melted it into slag, from which the galaxy's greatest artisans have forged a grand, towering statue... of me! A statue even larger and grander than the one you toppled, pinning me under its plinth, the day you nearly destroyed my Throne Room! The statue stands here in the Grand Ballroom of my Great Celestial Palace, covered in a gigantic space-tarp, but not so fast, Crum, we are not yet ready for the grand unveiling. 
I have captured the traitorous Princess Angela and her rebel allies from the Spaceship Tax Evader and immobilized them in geo-stationary orbit above my palace. At the merest touch of a button, I can activate the Astro-Detonator and delight the assembled billions here with a fireworks display the likes of which the great Butronian Empire has never seen! Princess Angela may be my own daughter, but that will not stop me from turning her and her fellow Wiki-lovers into space-dust. Even now, helplessly strapped into titanium space-manacles, they witness all I say and do on the Projecto-Screen of the Gallant. Hello, my fair daughter. How does it feel to lay eyes once again on your own... DOOM?
Ha ha ha ha ha!
See how I have seized your puny Earth friends, your boob-lover helper Guy Chapman and boy sidekick Jayjg? They too shall be forced to look on as I gorge in ecstasy at your failure and destroy your planet! Even now, I can see they long for me to discharge the Fang-Creatures of Carnivoron into their glass-walled prison, thus releasing them from the agony of witnessing my victory... But no! First, they will watch you writhe in defeat!
And that is not all, Crum! Surely, even slung in your titanium chains above the Flames Of Hate, you can see that to my right I have, held at Blasto-Ray-point by my Robo-Legionnaires, bound and displayed for all to see... Jimbo Wales and his Rocket Squad! Repturova, the Talurnian walking-lizard spy who betrayed me by joining you! Weissus, commander of the Valkyrie War-Jet Platoon! And last but not least... your beloved Julian Van August!
And now, with the merest wave of my Hypno-Scepter... Watch as your darling Earth friend tumbles under my spell. DANCE! Dance for my amusement! Let the sight of your seductively writhing body, contorting itself for my viewing pleasure, be the last thing Crum sees before she is lowered into the Flames! 
Tears?! Do I see tears in the eyes of the brave Crum375, also kown as Linda Mack? Oh-ho! Even I, in my most sinister, depraved dreams, would never have imagined it!
DANCE FOR MY AMUSEMENT! NEH-HEH heh-heh-heh-heh! HA HAHAHAHA!
How glorious! At last, with trumpet fanfare from my Astro-Orchestra, I order the curtain raised from my statue and...WHAT?!! ... It's a newly rebuilt Star Of Abuse IV! And who is that emerging from the gangplank? Crum, herelf?! 
NO! 
Buddy Jayjg has activated a hidden radio signal! The Rocket Squad is bursting free and shrinking my Robo-Legionnaires into nothing with Transmut-O-Bracelets concealed in their manacles! Weissus swings his mighty Space-Mace, smashing the controls to my torturous devices! My Hypno-Scepter, forced from my grasp by Prince Kazak's Magneto-Shooto-Beam! Julian Van August, running free into the awaiting arms of... CRUM?
Then, who is the prisoner suspended above the Flames Of Hate? What? Emitting the telltale sparks and ear-smoke of an android double? Drat! It's nothing more than a simple robo-mannequin decoy! 
Aiyeee! The Spaceship Gallant, with Princess Angela at the helm, is dive-bombing the Great Celestial Palace! Billowing clouds of space-smoke! Crowds running everywhere! Kaff! I'm choking! Kaff, kaff! Victory has—kaff—slipped through my fingers—kaff, kaff!—once again! Kaff, kaff!—CURSE YOU, CRUM kaff 375! Kaff! CURSE kaff YOU kaff FOREVER! Kaff, kaff, kaff, kaff...

On Page 269, the author writes: """"Similarly, if the Ramdasias do not follow the occupation of Chamars, it is no reason to separate them from that castes. So if a Ramdasia is Julaha, that is a weaver, and if he is 'Bazzaz' that is a draper, his caste remains unchanged. If a Chamar, a leather-worker becomes a Sikh and receives 'pahul' to-day, he at once joins the Ramdasias. The Ramdasias do receive the daughters in marriage of ordinary Chamars, but give them 'pahul' before associating with them"""".........""""The the Ramdasi is still a Chamar"""". 

On page 300, the author writes: """"The Sikh Chamar or Ramdasia. — It will be seen from Table VIII A that in the north and centre of the Eastern Plains a very considerable number of Chamiirs have embraced the Sikh religion. These men are called Ramdasia after Gui-u Ram Das, though what connection they have with him I have been unable to discover. Perhaps he was the first Guru to admit Chamars to the religion. Many, perhaps most of the Ramdasia Chamars have abandoned leather-work for the loom ; they do not eat carrion, and they occupy a much higher position than the Hindu Chamars, though they are not admitted to religious equality by the other Sikhs. The Ramdasia are often confused with the Raidiisi oi Rabdasi Chamars. The former are true Sikhs, and take the pdhul. The latter are Hindus, or if Sikhs, only Nanakpanthi Sikhs and do not take the pcikul ; and are followers of Bhagat Rav Das or Rab Das, himself a Chamar. They are apparently as true Hindus as any Chamars can be, and are wrongly called Sikhs by confusion with the Ranidasias"""".

The statements in the lead are not only non-neutral, they are slanderous:

The first sentence frames the quote """"wanting to play the game too much"""" as a direct quote from the EA spokesperson, which is false. It is nowhere to be found in the original statement; this is in fact Destructoid's interpretation. The second sentence victimizes the users. This does not belong in the article, let alone the Lead. For describing EA's statement, I feel that leaving out a comment on """"players were having such a good time"""" would be better because the phrase is ambiguous.

"Ok, I've made it into a team roster through 315.  Someone more familiar with the later issues will need to do the rest.
Some notes:
(1) Professor X is rarely a member of the team.  Thus I've removed him generally.  During the Gold Team period it could be argued he deserves a listing.  There's also a brief period from 184-200 where he is very occasionally engaged in field activities with the X-Men, but its 1-2 isolated issues, not a consistent trend.  If anyone wants to make an argument for his inclusion *on the team roster*, here is the place to do it, but assumption should be against including him unless he's explicitly on the team.
 Magneto is similarly never a member of the X-Men team in the #200-225 period, but is instead Headmaster of Xaviers, and is also excluded.
(2) This wikipedia page is for the comic Uncanny X-Men (and under various former titles), not the characters or the team.  As such, it should be about the publication and reflect the publication history.  Among other implications, I've chosen to omit reference to the Changeling impersonating Professor X and the Phoenix Force impersonating Jean Grey, because both of them had nothing to do with the book *as published* for the issues they are supposed to have appeared in.  (The Changeling is of course also omitted because Professor X wasn't actually a member of the team at that time).
(3) For characters whose absences are of brief or intermittent duration, I've tended to leave them on the team roster rather than have a lot of quick team changes.  Similarly, in time periods where multiple characters join or leave the team in short order, I've tended to agglomerate all those changes into one change, and thus a character may join or leave the team shortly after the start of the listing or before the end of the listing.

"Indeed, you're probably on to something. I think the Fourth Generation fighter page has really helped clear up things and added some much needed depth. If it is something that could be agreed on by the whole 'community' than perhaps there could be a seperate page for each generation of fighter jet linked from the main fighter aircraft page(and perhaps prop fighters as well). Until then though there isn't really any sort of guidline as to this specific page other for the sake of completeness. It is in my opinion that until seperate pages are created for Third, Second and First generation fighter jets then I don't really think the addition of one aircraft will really cause a lot of problem until such action is undertaken. Especially given that pretty much every single jet fighter is already on the list. The days of where nearly every country could create their own fighter like in WWII are long gone. Perhaps to at least organise the clutter, rather than listing aircraft vertically, it could be done horizontally like with the inter-war aircraft to at least make the page 'shorter'. To stay on topic though, is it agreed that the Mitsubishi F-1 is indeed, a fighter aircraft?",0.0

 Nick Estonia 

Nickelodeon Estonia is a children's television channel in Estonia. It was announced in March 1993 and was launched on 1 September 1993. It was owned by TeleTV Co. before the owner of the company died in September 2007, causing the company to merge with Viacom Media Networks.

 History 
 1993 to 1998 
The channel was officially launched as a block on Comedy Central, airing from 4:00 am to 9:00 am on Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, 4:00am to 8:00 am on Tuesdays and Fridays and 3:00 am to 10:00 am on Saturdays and Sundays.

Nickelodeon launched as a channel on 14 March 1994 at 4:00 pm, offering a lineup of classic Nicktoons and original programming each day from 3:00 am to 10:00 pm. There was also a block called Nick Jr. which ran on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays from 5:00 am to 8:00 am. On Fridays and Saturdays, it also had a section from 6:00 pm to 8:00 pm.

Nick Jr. aired for the final time on Nickelodeon on  launched as its own channel on 8 March 1998 and launched as its own channel, along with Nick Show on 9 March.

 1998 to 2001 

Nick Jr. and Nick Show both aired from 5:00 am to 8:00 pm. Nick Show was also commercial-free until 2005. Nickelodeon also introduced an Estonian version of Nickelodeon Kids Choice Awards.

On 1 April 1999, Nickelodeon aired a newsbeat at exactly 3:29pm saying """"Tonight, the world is going to be invaded by zombies, we recommend to lock all doors and remain alert."""" This was an April Fools joke, but the man who originally thought of this joke was arrested (but didn't go to prison).

On 30 November 2001, Nickelodeon Estonia adopted the 'splat' design, thought it was not properly used until 2005.

 2001 to 2005 
2001 also saw Nick Jr.'s The Bedtime Business Song air for the first time. The song reached number 4 in the Estonian charts.

On 1 October 2003, following the launch of Nick Cannon, a TV channel dedicated to Nick Cannon, the Nick brand got the slogan """"Number One"""". There was also a song produced for this strapline called """"Number One"""". The song was later sampled by Tinchy Strider and N-Dubz for their song Number One.

On 31 August 2005, the 'splat' design was fully used, songs """"Number One"""" and """"The Bedtime Business Song"""" were scrapped and Nick Cannon was replaced with Nick GAS.

Article needs review by nuclear physicist(s)
Just skimming the introduction I found three rather significant factual errors which I corrected.  I review those here.

The first point was that the article insisted that fusion occurs between like-charged atomic nuclei, but this limitation is not true.  For example, a nuclear reaction of 12C+16O can proceed through the fusion channel, yet their atomic charge differs.  There are literally hundreds of such cases, and citation would be gregarious and seems unnecessary (but I can link a few articles if anyone disputes this point).

The article suggested that two protons can fuse, and even suggested that such a reaction is governed by the nuclear strong force.  Not true.  p+p->d is a weak interaction, because you must convert a proton into a neutron.  Weak interactions are not fusion.

This error leads to a more general point.  Simply putting nuclei together to make something heavier does not constitute fusion.  A common misconception is that nuclear fusion refers to any coalescence of nuclei, but in nuclear physics, fusion is a specific reaction mechanism.  I will need to confirm, but I believe that, for example, the reactions in the CNO cycles proceed mainly through radiative capture, which isn't fusion.  I can find comments in the introduction instructing me not to correct the """"general"""" statement about nucleosynthesis, but the point is that this is generalized so much that it is incorrect.  I can even find comments there saying not to link to the s-process, but the s-process does not involve fusion reactions as far as I know.  There are actually a rather limited number of stellar nucleosynthesis cases that actually proceed through the fusion mechanism, such as carbon burning and oxygen burning.  These are literally the only two examples I can think of off hand that I'm sure proceed via fusion.  All the rest I'm fairly dubious about at the moment, although some of the pp-chain reactions may also be fusion.

Thus, we in fact need likely a whole section explaining the nuclear physics of fusion and what it is and what it is not.

Finally, I noticed that the article suggested humans have never controlled fusion.  This is naff.  There are plenty of nuclear physics experiments which have not only controlled fusion, but made very careful measurements of the properties of the fusion mechanism at many energy scales.  Clearly, the writer wanted to imply that fusion as a source of stable source of energy has never been achieved by humans, so this was changed to reflect that point.

But given that I could find a serious physics error in every paragraph I read so far, clearly this article needs some serious attention Please do not revert my corrections without discussing the matter here or explicit citation indicating that I am incorrect.    """,0.0

Hello user at address 90.184.243.14,

Hmmm... I don’t really agree with your comments.  I guess the disagreement boils down to what we think that Wikipedia stands for.

I was under the impression that one of the aims of Wikipedia was that it allowed information to be distributed freely worldwide and not to be controlled by commercialist corporations.  You clearly disagree with this perception.  

I take your point that the H-K adsorption isotherm isn't as popular as Langmuir & BET but the equation is peer reviewed and used by a number of research groups.  Taking the info off the adsorption website would consign this peer reviewed equation to books and journals that people would have to pay to access.  

I see this action as being very much against the Wikipedia ethos and think that the text should be reinstated immediately.

Moreover, if possible I think that people should be encouraged to add other “lower status” equations to the webpage so that as much information as possible is disseminated free of charge.    

Regarding the text being written in a journal style format: does it really matter as long as it communicates the workings of the equation?",0.0

Question from Bishonen: an injunction for XAL?
Oops. I didn't realize that the Bogdanov Affair affair had made it to RFAR; I just blocked XAL for the third time for unrepentant personal attacks. 72 hours. Should I unblock her so she can respond to this RFAR? I'd appreciate it if she could get an injunction against editing anywhere else, though (especially not on Talk:Bogdanov Affair), for what would have been the duration of the block. I'm not happy about all this vitriol she spreads, and, from past experience, I'd expect it to be worse now that I've gotten her worked up with a new block. Bishonen | talk  PS, re Snowspinner's request above that XAL along with other users be banned from editing the article: she never has edited it. Never edited any article on wikipedia. I want her banned from the article's talkpage.

For what it is worth, I support this motion. XAL has contributed nothing to the discussion, in stark contraindistinction to most of the other users like Igor or rbj or ybm, and often stirs things up. Maru (talk)  
Also from an outsider: XAL appears to only rant and to only rant on one topic (user:YBM, whose letters are sequentially one after hers, like IBM and HAL), and to contribute nothing but a negative  an anti- point of view. Thus, she seems to have come to us from some outside web fight and longterm flamewar. Since coming here, she has demonstrated the grace, understanding, curiosity, and equanimity of a wounded hyena with rabies. Geogre  

What do you know about all that but what I told you specifically, like HAL, and did you read my settlement proposal at all? no did you read the answers being made to it by your idiotic friends rjb and maru?
no
You talk without knowing like you have always done. You are a gossip, nothing alse but a gossip who never bring any prooves to his accusations nor explain why he removed the totality of my talk page. You are adishonnest lier and being one of the accused person in my arbitration you have no place in it with empty commentars ans accusations against me as well as bishonnen has no rights to mix up in the talk page she was asked to stay away from.
She is sick as you are of spendin gtoo much tiem far away from the real world ans only dreaming of retaliation against me as she ans you project on me your own frustration of being so meningless.
And ignorants.
I am the one who made the firsts conciensius of the talk page and in fact brought that word for the first time in it.
It was done by me already in august this year, and you will know it if you could read.
You don't know about fact as yu don't know about the scientific methods.
You are rants. You speak on an arbitration where you are most unwelcome with the same empty sind as you pass your idiotic sonnet and your fat ass: happy of your ignorancy and passing the marshmallow.

 

For what it is worth, I support this motion. XAL has contributed nothing to the discussion, in stark contraindistinction to most of the other users like Igor or rbj or ybm, and often stirs things up. Maru (talk)  

No comments, see the art gallery for concret proove that what he say reflect what he is and does, not my doing and being. This is again a projection.

 

All the people who are now playing in the kindergarten called the arbitration, are all without exception people who weren't there when the reason for this arbitration was decided: in august and first week of september.
So pack your dirty loundry and found a more constructiv way to wash your personal problems and clear out your relationships issues.
This arbitration is about the reality of an organisation having build up this whole affair since nov 2003 up to today, and known as the postsituationists group, under the direction of Jean Pierre Voyer, directing the actions to be taken in close cooperation with YBM.
The rest is rant and superficiality.
it has been cleared out for a month and a week ago that the subject of the talk page was not wether the theory were validate or not but on the validity of this affair.
Since I came with proove of the actions of the organisation, the talk page has became a complete rant and battle field with most participation from rjb who know absolutely nothing from it but who notheless play the all knowing man from day one.

Iranian Villagers
Halstead et al. reported that some Iranian villagers with very little animal product intake (dairy once a week, meat once a month) had normal B12 levels. None had megaloblastic anemia. Their average B12 level was 411 pg/ml which was quite high considering their diet. The authors speculated this could be because their diets, which were very low in protein, allowed for B12-producing bacteria to ascend into the ileum where the B12 could be absorbed. They also speculated that because they lived among their farm animals and their living areas were littered with feces, they picked up enough B12 through contamination.

Halstead et al.'s 1960 report was in contrast to Wokes et al.'s 1955 report  in which numerous British vegans were found to have neurological symptoms of B12 deficiency.

Conclusion
B12 production by bacteria in the small intestine is possible. Some vegans can ward of overt vitamin B12 deficiency, and even mild B12 deficiency by remaining cautious. Now people like mihaiam may choose to doubt all these scientific findings hinging on their favourite anti-vegan blogs.

"""
Actually, Nin Einne is right. I'll try to explain why. First thing: all scientific information (i.e. somewhat accurate info...) should be publically verifyable, where verifyable means that one can check whatever is claimed, and public refers to the fact that anyone can do that. Now, if you cite some source, like in the example above, it says """"blah blah near daily""""(citation number). Unlike what you might think, that does not mean that the sentence """"blah blah near daily"""" is a universally accepted fact  as proven by the fact that you have another opinion. What the phrase """"blah blah near daily""""(citation number) actually means is """"in (citation number), someone claims blah blah near daily"""", which, you'll agree, is fully correct. After all, that is what's written there and anyone can look at the source (because it's public) and read what is says (verifyable). Now, if you think that blah blah occured daily an not near daily, that is fine. But how should you go about it ? One thing you can not do: change the sentence and leave the citation! Because then it would mean: """"in (citation number), someone claims blah blah daily"""". That is not true! If you look at the source, you'll see it says """"blah blah near daily""""! Which is just what Nil Einne pointed out. Of course it can happen that what's written in the source is not accurate. But that doesn't mean you have the right to change it as you did.
What you can do is add another source that contradicts the first one. You could write It has been reported that """"blah blah near daily""""(citation number), but I think that """"blah blah daily"""". The moment you do this, however, you'll find that people will object, because what you have presented is not publically verifyable. So, what is needed here is a source, a pointer to publically verifyable information, to support your claim. The full list of newspapers would be ok, but very unpractical. If there is a single list somewhere, preferably produced by a fairly neutral source such as United Nation observers of something equivalent, that would be much easier.
You might think it's much more important to tell the truth accurately, even if you don't find a source, because, after all, the truth is what it's all about. Unfortunately, there is no such thing as the truth, a universally and unanimously accepted version of events, and certainly not in the Israelian-Palestian conflict. Imagine for a moment that everybody would put their version of the truth on the page, and what the page would then look like! So, we are bound by certain rules that allow us to govern information about events without spiraling into chaos, and these very rules that exist to create accurate information state that sticking to the rules is more important that providing accurate information. Strange as it may seem, it works: even when not perfectly accurate, the result will not stray to far from the truth, if there is any one such thing, and that result is usually a fairly useful document as opposed to a flamewar.""",0.0

"""

The first issue here is use of use of the word """"revealed"""" religion, which was completely well sourced, but you have reverted (and again, you have also done some massive modifications without any consensus at all), to show some two theories. Your whole argument is based on one sentence from one source, while I would provide several references below. But, before that, your one source does not even contradict it being a revelation. 

From your own one source:

Page 78: """"...Guru Gobind Singh's work is best understood as the fulfillment of Guru Nanak's revelation. The Sikh organization had taken on the semblance of a State during...""""

So your own source is describing it as """"Guru Nanak's revelation"""". Now, my addition was well-sourced, and I can add here tens of other sources. But, I believe, at this point, there is no need to even share them, since your own source agrees with revelation. 

Next, you keep quoting the sentence on """"not being Prophet, but illumined soul"""". As per your own definition, """"Prophet is one who utters divinely inspired revelations, believed to have come from God"""". In this sense, since your own source says revelations, it is completely fringe and weak to consider even the """"non-Prophet"""" aspect as reliable. Especially when there are 10s of other reliable sources that also use the words """"revelations"""" and """"Prophets"""". And further, again, even in your own source, when describing """"Guru"""", the author quotes:

""""On account of his divine prerogative and attributes the Guru, though human in form, is godly in spirit. God speaks to humanity through him. God enlightens the seekers of truth through him and his word.""""

The author also states, """"Guru Gobind Singh tells Bhai Nand Lal .... (Guru is) the Light which is eternally God and represents God's Being in pure form. It is because of the consummate perfection, that God is in the Guru and the Guru is in God."""" 

So, I have not even brought it any of the other 10s of sources, and your own single source is so weak (and on the contrary, it actually supports """"revelations"""", """"God is in the Guru"""" """"God speaks to humanity through him""""). As I had said before, it is you who needs to get consensus before your massive unexplained edits that you keep performing. 

And finally, as a general advice, the fact that Sikhs consider the Gurus to be direct messengers sent by God, and the Guru Granth Sahib to be the word of God, is one of the most  basic and fundamental beliefs in Sikhism. I am surprised you are not aware of such a basic and fundamental aspect.   """,0.0

 Being patriotic to your country and anarchism are not mutually exclusive. Sounds like you have been reading too much Communist propaganda. Communists just love to subvert governments and China is trying to subvert this one right now. I personally would love to overthrow the fascist-socialist state we're in right now and get back our freedom. But Maoism is not something I would have in mind in the way of freedom.
 Blah and Bockade, since you think you know the ideologies that are best for me, let me find one for you. Hmm, maybe subverting your current government into a dictatorshiptotalitarian state would be appropriate. Or perhaps, as you are incapable of reading comprehension or the most rudimentary thought, working in a convenience store, rather than editing what used to be an encyclopedia would be a good idea for you. Or maybe, how about going and fucking yourself. Now, after having  baited me with your ignorant and idiotic comments, go running to the admins and report me for PAing you, thereby proving beyond any shadow of a doubt how unanarchistic yet socialistic you really are.

Apparantly, Aaron this article is the way you'' want it to be, just to get some accuracy into your last comment.

Ok, I just watched the whole video and nowhere in it does anyone say anything about ADD. All the video was about was something called Habbo (which I guess is some website) and an interview the boys did that consisted of your basic, run of the mill fangirl questions. If there is something about ADD in there, it must in some kind of code that my old ass can't decipher, but I heard no such admission. As for using YouTube as a source, I wouldn't accept it as one. I don't know if there is a policy about YouTube not being used, but I tend to replace YouTube links anyway because they are forever removing videos and if something is true and noteworthy, there would be more than just a video source. In this case, I found nothing else to back up the ADD claim. Perhaps the person who wants to include it should give find a secondary source because the one provided doesn't back up the content. You were right to remove it and it is a BLP issue at this point which means it needs to go until it is properly sourced.  Say it... """,0.0

 From Wikipedia:Requested moves 

December 31, 2007
:Rock Band (video game) → Rock Band — There is no page at Rock Band or Rock band, as they're just redirects, hence no reason for the (video game) at the end. — (talk | contributions) 
Actually, there was an article at Rock band until somebody decided to merge it a couple of weeks ago (and that wasn't even a clear consensus). If anything, both should redirect to Rock music (which Rock band was merged with). So I don't think this is uncontroversial.  Spyke 
You beat me to the punch.  Clearly the term rock band is well used in the wiki and this needs to be discussed.  I think moving as proposed would be too confusing since the distinction is Rock Band v rock band.    
Dab That's what {{for}} is for. Simply put {{for|the genre of music|Rock music}} or somesuch. Either way, Rock Band should not redirect to Rock Band (video game). -·T·C·M 
Noting that a couple of thousand pages link to Rock band, and most of them refer to a group of people playing rock music, and not to a video game, I think we can't have Rock band redirecting to Rock Band (video game), as it now does. On the other hand, Far fewer pages link to Rock Band, and a higher proportion of them refer to the video game. Thus, as far as internal linking is concerned, it makes sense to have Rock band as a redirect to Rock music, and to move Rock Band (video game) to Rock Band, placing hatnotes on both articles. The alternative would be to have Rock band and Rock Band redirect to Rock music, and leave Rock Band (video game) where it is, with a hatnote at Rock music. The only reason to go with the second option would be if we think people are likely to type """"Rock Band"""" into the search box when they're thinking of bands playing rock music.  One other thing - why are we discussing this here, instead of at the article talk page? - 

I've just copied the above from WP:RM, where it was listed in the """"incomplete proposals"""" section. Consulting this talk page, a few sections up, it's clear that this page was just moved from Rock Band a little while ago, so before anybody decides to move it back, I thought I'd try to bring all the discussion to the same page. I would also direct the attention of anyone interested to Talk:Rock band, where I've left a comment about why that page really needs to say redirected to Rock music, unless someone does something about the 2300 broken links first. - """,0.0

Yes, true. I never used the term """"anti-vax"""" term as it is perjorative (new word for me, but just the one I've been looking for), and for that reason you wont find anyone who is anti-vax describing themselves as such. It has always been thus, eg this 1895 book by Hutton """"Anyone who adopts the cause of the """"anti-vaccinator"""" is, ipso facto, reckoned by a vast number of people—who on any other subject would judge fairly and patiently—a crank, a faddist, and a fool.""""  You can see this in front of your eyes by reading the page Midgley has created. You can see his intent by the way the more suitable and non-emotive term Vaccine Critics was deleted for this page.  He may believe sincerley that anti-vax are psychotic, but that doesn't make it OK. Also anti-vax are a small section of vaccine critics, so he is effectively deleting 90% of vaccine criticism.  And to get an idea about the term, I would have to ask people if they were happy to be termed """"anti-vax"""", as I wouldn't list them as such otherwise.  15:37, 10""",0.0

 Morphology 

I think that a few words should be written about endings of various kinds, and of distinctions of cases.  There seems to be some misunderstandings here and there in the project, with claims that """"German has preserved the proto-germanic grammar"""" or similarly.  This is not 100% true (although German certainly has preserved much of the grammar).  I therefore think that mentioning the instrumental case, and the fact that there were more different endings in OHG than in modern High German is interesting enough to merit a section.  I do not think we should try to reproduce all paradigms; but some representative sample.  (However, I just know them from rather old books; and these books do not very carefully distinguish different epochs or dialects within the OHG.)
I had in mind an example like this:

    Sing.    Pl. N    tag    taga G    tages    tago D    tage    tagum A    tag    taga I    tagu    (not distinguishable)

and a few words on how e.g. 1:st and 3:rd p. pl. of the verbs then were quite distinct (in pres. ind. normally ending in -mes and -nt, and in pret. -m and -n, respectively); where in the modern language a final -m is replaced by an -n, making the forms indistinguishable.  Is this sensible?  """,0.0

In fact, one of the most egregious ways in which tags are being abused is that they're being used for POV-pushing and opinion mongering.  Wikipedia doesn't allow personal opinions in the bodies of articles, and has numerous safeguards in place to prevent it, but having your personal opinion about the nature of an article in the format of a tag, and that opinion will be allowed to disfigure the article practically forever.Were I of a mind to fight against an article I disagree with, politically or philosophically, I wouldn't try to change the text or duke it out on the talk page, I'd stick a """"neutrality disputed"""" tag on it and walk away.  The tag would sit there on the top of the page, big as life, scaring people away from the article, even though I provided no evidence to back it up, and did not have to go through any process before I posted it.  In fact, by simply starting an argument on the talk page, I can provide the backing someone disputing the tag might need  and I get the argument out there without it having to prevail  simply the existence of the argument justifies the tag.I'm not at all saying that's what's going on here  as I said I'm not concerned with this specificity of this tag  but it's another example of why tags are dangerous and should not be accorded the kind of carte blanche they curently receive.

"As with all coins, the value depends on the condition of a coin, its rarity, and the state of the market  the rarest coin will be worth nothing if no-one wants to buy it where it is being offered for sale.

That said, the British grading system for coins works like this (I will not touch the lunatic American grading system with 70 different grades!):-

 Poor coins are very worn, and most of the detail of the coin will have gone, but you're still able to tell what type of coin it is.
 Fair coins are well worn, but more of the detail of the coin is visible, and it is easy to identify the coin.
 Good coins will have almost all the lettering readable, and the date will be easy to read in most cases.
 Very Good coins  will have all the coin readable, and some of the finer details of the design can start to be made out.
 Fine coins will have the details of the coins taking shape, and the coin is starting to become collectable if it's fairly recent.
 Very Fine coins will have all the details clear, and there will be wear only on the high points of the design, and most of the fine details shows clearly.
 Extremely Fine coins will have wear on only the highest points of the design.
 Uncirculated coins will have no wear on the high points of the design at all, though faults in the engraving, or wear on the die, may mean that the design may not be fully struck.

 Under no circumstances should collectible coins be cleaned or polished  this will destroy at least half its' collectible value.

Coming back to your 1862 penny, values for a bog-standard penny in UK Pounds, in Britain, are:

F - GBP 4
VF - GBP 10
EF - GBP 40
UNC - GBP 70

Lower grades are not worth anything much.

Multiply by 1.6 to get a US $ figure, then discount any amount for reduced interest in the coins in the States!

MovieFan Contribs
I deleted the edits by User MovieFan because most of them were inaccurate in light of the latest research. For example: Peg Entwsitle was never in """"bit parts"""" or a """"handful of films."""" Extensive research for her biography, which included weeks of reviewing original RKO office memos, contracts, and payroll records concerning Entwistle, support her having a role in just one film.

Moreover, the claim regarding Entwistle's Los Angeles play """"The Mad Hopes"""" in the newspaper item sourced by MovieFan is completely spurious. Contrary to this source, the play, a pre-Broadway tryout, was a rousing success in San Diego and Los Angeles during its several-weeks' run. My research discovered many reviews and theatrical periodicals containg nothing but praise for the play and players. The MovieFan source contained, """"but nothing came of it,"""" in regard to a context insinuating that Peg hadn't got the part. In fact, the premiere of this play at the Belasco was a Red Carpet event on the scale of a Hollywood film premiere!

The contribs by MovieFan with regard the divorce of Entwistle and Robert Keith are only partly accurate, taken from news accounts whereas the official and complete court testimony by Peg Entwistlewhich I have in my posessiondoes not entirely reflect MovieFan's edit. The """"hair pulling"""" account is in fact reflected in the official court document, but does this information actually improve the Wiki?

There is more I can discuss, however, I wish to make it clear that I do not want to discourage MovieFan, or anyone else, from contributing to Peg Entwistle's Wiki. God knows the wars that have been waged in the past regarding it! But I simply found it easier to Undo the MovieFan contribs in their entirety in the hopes that MovieFan, or anyone else, would discuss the content.

Honestly, while I'm very pleased that Peg Entwistle has so many fans, I think her Wiki should be left as is. Using the old sources, such as tabloids and newspapers is a tricky affair with many red herrings. It's best, I believe, to leave the Entwistle page alone.

"What Is Multiculturalism? 

http://internationalpoliticalissues.blogspot.com/2011/07/what-is-multiculturalism.html

July 28-2011.

What Is Multiculturalism?

Definition: The doctrine that several different cultures (rather than one national culture) can coexist peacefully and equitably in a single country. Therefore, these types of societies can also be described as Plural societies/cultures. Then what does these types of societies have to do to ensure that all ethnic/cultural groups get along well, without strife, hatred, partisanship, or stereotyping? 

If the concept of Multiculturalism is truly going to work for the benefit of the entire commonweal, then the national policies must ensure there is equity in economic opportunities, job opportunities, educational opportunities, and the acquisition open to all. Political affiliation and association allowed to all, freedom of the press, TV, Internet, radio, and other media to all, and judicial representation or habeas Corpus for all who need or seek it.

All Are Supposedly Equal Except Others?

In some societies if you are not a member of the major ethnic or racial group, then you are socially, politically, and sometimes considered a second class citizen. This is overtly and covertly enforced via educational quotas, regional developmental quotas in funding programs, that cater to those second class citizens, and are treated socially as inferiors.

In the EU, and most of the other European countries currently, there is a growing trend to see all immigrants, especially Immigrants Of Color, Arabs/Muslims, as a threat to the stability of those countries. Some states within the union have already legislated against these immigrants, specifying that they wear certain attire in public places, or state owned institutions, and seek to integrate into the mainstream culture in order to be accepted.  

Right Wing Fanaticism:

This idea promulgated by the above groups, that Whites/Caucasians are the only ones who are qualified to occupy Europe is gaining momentum. And that all foreigners to the European hemisphere are not welcomed to reside therein, without the expressed permission of the state concerned. Exceptions are those on holiday, diplomats, and other technocrats that are allowed to reside therein. And marriage between Europeans and non-Europeans must not be allowed or permitted.

""" 2009 (UTC)

 The7thdr: the reasons were several - and you're not going to like them.  1) Tony Blair was a war-mongerer who was not in the slightest bit interested in stability or peace.  having such a person as a Prime Minister was a seriously bad idea.  2) not quite in exactly these words, but close to it, Maharishi stated that if the UK population was so stupid as to vote in a war-mongerer, then they were not welcome to benefit from the stabilising effects of TM. 3) on the basis that evil tends to become more obvious when there is less stabilising to counteract it, Maharishi ordered everyone OUT of the country, or to get as fast as possible into Vaastu (spiritual-protecting) homes.  4) in this way, Maharishi surmised that the UK population would, thick as two xxxxing short planks as it was (overall - not all of it, obviously), be able to get through its stupid thick collective head that there was something desperately wrong with its leaders, much quicker and much more obviously than if the TM meditators were """"accidentally"""" stabilising the country. 5) additionally, TM practitioners, by leaving the country, would not be subjected to quite so much stress.  The7thdr: you should by now be going """"oh. ah. um. err. i see."""" and perhaps now have a clearer idea of why it would be inappropriate to put such a description onto the page which describes the """"Transcendental Meditation Technique"""" rather than describing """"The History Of The Transcendental Meditation Movement"""", yes?   21:31, 6 April""",0.0

If this is true, we should keep in mind that this info should ultimately be on the page for this topic.  The trick is supporting that it's true, of course.  I looked at your source for the ballot, and it's unclear to me how recent the information on that page is (I couldn't find a date of publication for the info, and my half-knowledge of Spanish may be insufficient to help me know whether this is or is not the current government's ballot for the upcoming elections (as opposed to the ballot as it had existed previously, before the crisis).  But if it is the current government's version of the ballot, that's interesting, especially since it seems like César Ham in particular should be disqualified by Article 239 just as it was argued Zelaya was.  (Possibly Reyes as well, but definitely Ham given that he participated in the """"reclaiming of the ballots"""" thing.)  That's an inconsistency in the argument of the Micheletti side.

I note that this is a Honduran source, which may not be admissible under the current """"Honduran newspapers are likely to be mouthpieces for the establishment, so they're not reliable sources"""" view which has been prevailing here, but it's unlikely a pro-Micheletti source, on the other hand, would lie about what Micheletti's formal position is.  We could probably trust it to print what Micheletti says will be on the ballot.  I'm more concerned that I'm not sure the source you've posted here has a date indicating that it is the current version of the ballot.   """,0.0

I smell trouble brewing.  Let's figure this out before an edit war starts.  I see a few issues here in dispute: 
1) Cold-blooded=stockier draft type vs. cold-blooded=origin in cold climates.  I had learned it as the draft-type definition, but I have seen both definitions in use.  I don't necessarily think they are mutually exclusive.  While I think that the geographical terminology likely defined the core original breeds, with years of interbreeding this becomes messy.  So many breeds have differing degrees of both types.  For example, Warmbloods are not the only mixtures of European and Arabian blood.  Wouldn't this strict definition mean that Quarter Horses would be a type of warmblood? My feeling is that we can say something like: """"The hot-blooded/cold-blooded terminology originally related to the geographical origin of the breed, but now has come to refer to the overall character of the horse or pony.""""

2) Ponies (most if not all) are cold-blooded because they originated in cold climates vs. some ponies are cold-blooded because they are draft-type.  Again, I think we can finesse this without saying that one is right or wrong.  I personally think that most ponies are draft-type, and so could be considered cold-blooded, with certain hot-blooded exceptions like the [Hackney pony].  Although, really, come to think of it, lots of ponies are more like little warmbloods...

3) Ponies were not used for 'draft' work in general because they were too small.  As I understand it, some pony breeds flourished at times because they were useful as draft horses in the mines.  For example: """"when the coal mining industry became extensively developed in Britain in the 1800’s, Shetlands were imported in great numbers to haul coal cars in the 'pits'."""" (From """"Shetland Pony"""")

Proposal

Look all I am saying is that the term """"Iranian"""" is a very loose term and people can get easily confused when they see this. Iranic would be a better term to use. Nontheless, there is no doubt that the Kurdish language is a bit similar to other languages such as Persian but there is also a difference as well. I am speaking as a Kurd myself. There is evidence that the Kurds have the highest chance out of all the other ethnic groups of being descendants of the Medes, all one has to do is look at lingustics. Although, it is also important to know that the Kurds have been in the middle east for a very very long time, and there have been many other empires/people as well. There have also been, for example, claims that Kurds are also descendants of the Gutians. It all boils down to what you believe, but to say that the Kurds are an Iranian people, is sort of going overboard. 

Kurds have been mentioned for a very longtime by many different people, including the Sumerians!

Nonetheless, I think there should be a change. I sort of agree with the Proposal above but I believe it can be better. Heres what I think should be written

Kurds are an ethnic group in the Middle East that inhabit adjacent parts of Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Syira known as Kurdistan. The Kurds speak a language known as Kurdish, which form a subgroup of the NorthWestern Iranian languages. The Kurds are known to be an Iranic people because of close linguistic and cultural ties with other Iranians. The Kurds are also known to be descendants of the Medes, according to many scholars.

Somewhere along those lines. Saying that Kurds are an """"Iranian ethnic group"""" is is vague, confusing, and somewhat mis-leading. What I wrote is a bit more clear and I wrote why they are considered an Iranic people with the sentences supporting it. Notice how I also said a language known as Kurdish. I do not know on what insane consensus that people decided it should be """"Kurdish language(s)."""" Kurdish is one language which is mainly based of two dialects, that are spoken by almost all Kurds. Those two dialects are Kurmanji and Sorani, both of which are highly similar. All Kurds regard their language as one. I am a Kurdish Sorani speaker and I can understand a Kurmanji speaker perfectly. Kurds in Turkey, Syria, and Half of Iraq speak Kurmanji. Then the other Half of Iraqi Kurdistan speak Sorani, with Kurds in Iran speaking Kurdish Sorani as well. There are also a few other dialects such as Hawrami which is spoken by about 10% of Kurds. Nonetheless, the Kurdish language is one language with 2 main dialects, both of which are highly similar to each other.

your requests for info
VoluntarySlave, FrancisTyers, Aaron, I have already answered most of your questions above. I won't be caught in your mind games. I have answered your questions. Intangible has. TheIndivdualist has. Answering once is enough for any of us.

As far as the big section about Proudhon: Proudhon called himself an anarchist, agreed, but could not tell the difference between anarchy and government. So we may as well include a section on Daffy Duck and his influence on the movement.

This is an article about anarchism. Not Russian anarchism. Not European anarchism. Just anarchism. So it's not a big leap to assume that American anarchism (or the anarchism of other countries) should be included.

There is more on American anarchism that needs to be in the article. These edits are just a start.

I'll find references to show how Jesus was anti-authoritarian and revolutionary and he most certainly was. I can't account for why the revolutionary direction to his desciples was not included in the article  Jesus, I didn't write it. I can imagine why, though, LOL.

You, socialist-communists just keep dominating this article like it personally belongs to you. It doesn't. You do the same thing to, or worse, stuff that you accuse other editors of doing, and then harass them to no end. Like what you are doing to Intangible right now, which I just discovered today.

To what ends will you go to guard this aricle and keep it communistic?  How low will you people go? Please try and behave yourselves. duck talk """,0.0

 The majority of economists do not follow Cagan´s 1956 definition of hyperinflation being 50% inflation per month for 12 months.  

I propose to remove the following sentence from the Definition sub-paragraph in the article: """"Economists usually follow Cagan’s description that hyperinflation occurs when the monthly inflation rate exceeds 50%."""" or replace it with: A handful of economists still follow Cagan´s descpription that hyperinflation occurs when the monthly inflation rate exceeds 50%. 

The generally accepted definition regarding hyperinflation is the IASB´s definition, namely, 100% cumulative inflation over three years. It is the definition followed by all accountants worldwide and by the far greater majority of economists. Only a small handful of economists follow Cagan´s definition. No government follows Cagan´s definition: thus, it is a fact that no macroeconomist advising any government follows Cagan´s definition.

It is completely misleading to present Cagan´s definition as the generally accepted definition of hyperinflation by economists in general. That is a completely false suggestion. 195.23.41.216  """,0.0

"Well, Arthur, I have printed the paper, and the condition is in fact what Ultra.Power says it is, not your correction. It seems that the paper is not incorrect, but rather correct and pointless.

You have already identified the worst problem: The third condition requires incontinuity of f at all integer values. However, this problem disappears if we consider only the special case a=e. So let's do that.

We want a function f satisfying f(1)=e and f(n+1)=exp(f(n)), defined as widely as possible. We observe that n=0 and n=1 present no problems: f(0)=1 and f(-1)=0.

To extend f to all positive real numbers, it is clearly sufficient to define f on an interval of length 1, such as [0,1).

And we want f to be continuously differentiable. (The paper only requires f to be continuously differentiable on (0,1), or equivalently on (-1,0). This is obviously whacky, but we needn't worry about this because a=e.)

Next, for no obvious (or explained) reason we require that f ' is monotone on the interval [0,1]. From the functional equation f(x) = ln f(x+1) we get f '(x) = f '(x+1)/f(x+1). Hence f '(-1)=f '(0)/f(0)=f '(0), so f ' must be constant on [0,1]! 

Not too surprisingly, the function we get in this way is patched together from smaller pieces in a relatively unnatural way: f(x) = exp[x](exp(x-[x])).

Thus what I learned from the paper is that the correct solution to the problem probably has a minimum of its derivative between -1 and 0.",0.0

"The sentence that both of you want added is completely irrelevant to what anarchocapitalism is, and is dealt with in the body of the text. I'll give you an example via wikiprecedent: christianity. The lede does say that protestantism came from catholicism, just as the lede for anarchocapitalism says that it is an individualist anarchism form (parent). But the lede of christianity does not say (though it could with references) that the catholics did not consider protestants to be christian (and vice-versa). And given that historically western christianity was catholic only for a thousand years, we see the argument from antiquity attempt clearly fail.

As to what you misunderstand, Binksternet, it is due weight. I'll give another wikiprecedent: evolution. There is neither mention of creationism nor ID in the lede for evolution. At all. Period. But it is clearly significant enough to have been brought up in court in the US many times regarding the teaching of it and of ID. One would think, then, that it would get mentioned.

Fowler&fowler; has thoughtfully invited me on my Talk page to comment. 
Nichalp says in the present thread """"The term """"British India"""" is generally used in popular parlance to separate independent India from British-governed India"""". I am sure there is some truth in that, but I think the reply is that Wikipedia shouldn't about """"popular parlance"""", it is an encyclopedia and needs to be about scholarship, about detailed and correct information, sourced as well as possible. To put that more grandly, it is about educating the world. To illustrate this point, in the """"popular parlance"""" of much of the world, """"Great Britain"""" and """"England"""" are much the same thing, but by education people learn the difference between them. To have an article on British India here, even one with much improvement needed to it, is a powerful tool in that process of education.
On Nichalp's suggestion that """"British India"""" should be redirected to British Raj"""", I and others do not agree with that, for all of the detailed reasons advanced so far: please see the discussion here and also at Talk:British Raj. And I believe Philip Baird Shearer has said correctly somewhere above that there is a consensus against such a redirect. 
Fowler&fowler; asks """"Would you be opposed to """"British India"""" being redirected to this overview article, British rule in India instead of """"British Raj?"""" """" I, of course, am one of those who believe Wikipedia needs a discrete article, so I should be opposed. 
In general, I do agree with the """"overview article"""" idea which has developed, and if I am invited to help in particular ways then I shall be glad to do what I can, but I do not believe 'British India' would be a possible title for that overview article, as the term has a correct meaning which is significantly less than the whole of India.  
One thought which I believe Fowler&fowler; had some time ago which does strike me as another possible compromise would be to merge Provinces of British India into British India. For reasons of space, the separation might one day be an advantage, but as matters stand at the moment this might be a rationalisation which could make sense to all of us?

Oppose - The current title is overwhelmingly preferred by the policy of using the most common name, and the manual of style specifically encourages editor discretion. The MOS is great for our writing style and when the official or common name might be unknown, but to argue that it should be used to take an official name with a specifically chosen title that is used by the absolutely overwhelming majority of reliable sources, including books, newspapers, and websites, as well as is the generally common name is fairly absurd. Our title guidelines and policies are unfortunately somewhat murky. But, what it comes down to can be gleaned from Wikipedia:Naming conventions (capitalization), which states that """"an adherence to conventions widely used in the genre are critically important to credibility"""". If Billboard is using a style, and Rolling Stone or the New York Times or Spin or just the bulk of reliable sourcing in general largely use the official title, is it really common sense for us to be saying we shouldn't be following the sources here in order to somehow adhere to conventions and gain credibility? Wikipedia is a unique construct in that our work is so clearly tied and based off of reliable sourcing about the subject  making us stand out and go against the grain here just doesn't make much sense.There's also just the general notion (which certainly should not be the deciding factor in finding consensus) that certain lowercase words just look weird in titles. Perhaps this may give some indication as to why """"like"""" and other 3 or more letter words are very often capitalized in composition titles but words like """"a"""", """"to"""", or """"and"""" often aren't.

Yurica's POV is that the Heubeck article promotes the use of deception. I just skimmed it and if there was anything in it promoting deception, I may have overlooked it. I did however find a quote about exalting """"objective truth"""", which I have added to the article.

Note, however, that I do not want the article to say that Yurica is wrong. That would violate NPOV - something I've never advocated. The article should remain neutral on the question of whether Weyrich or Heubeck advoacate deception. 

It should balance Yurica's interpretation of the Heubeck article (her POV) with the opposing POV (if there are no facts) or the facts if there are any.

THIS ARTICLE IS AN INSULT TO OBJECTIVITY
This article does a very poor job of maintaining an objective stance, it is undeniable. It is a travesty to make it appear as though Mark Kirk opposes the war in Iraq despite the fact that he helped write and co-sponsored the House Resolution to invade Iraq in 2003.

It is also absolutely ridiculous to boast that he received an award from the League of Conservation Voters, and yet fail to mention that the very same group gave him an """"F"""" rating last Congressional session""",0.14285714285714285
"Some Third-party opinions 

I've been asked to provide a third opinion on recent disputes.  Here goes:

Do you understand why File:Grand Kudu, Eritrea.jpg was deleted, Vetrisimino0?  I'd like to hear that you do; you should after a read of .  It seems the deletion was appropriate.  (And, it's reversible with permission logged via an [[Commons:OTRS| OTRS ticket].)
As for the suggestion to   From just reading this page, it looked like this had been settled, and the photos are to be left in and photos of members of other groups can be added over time (and there have been multiple other editors providing opinions already).  Good.  I would add that images should be shrunk or (better yet) merged, as at [:File:Eriamercol.jpg], so that this can happen.  However, I see File:Traditional_Eritrean_dance.jpg has replaced Tigrinya Eritrean wedding picture File:Eritrea_Eritrean_wedding.jpg.  Is this a problem?  I don't know the ethnicities of the photographed parties.  I haven't looked through the article's edit history and don't plan do.
Flickr has lots more appropriately licensed files.  I see File:Rashaida_family.png is on the french article, so there are photos available. 
Re. Faytinga photo: I think it should stay. Re.  The mayote site seems to be a mouthpiece for a particular set of politicial views, so I don't think it's a reliable source for much other than its own views. (My opinion would be swayed if it had a written fact-checking policy.)  However, given 3 other sources Vetrisimino0 says confirm Faytinga's mother's ethnicity, it seems reasonable to belive it's true.  Can you accept that, Middayexpress?  If not, I still think her picture merits inclusion (without noting her mother's ethnicity) and 'clutter' is a poor argument for its removal here.
I do wish to point out that a blanket order to a fellow editor like  is highly inappropriate and invalid here! The WP:BOLD guideline applies to, and allows, such edits.  However, so does the part of BOLD that guides one as to how to react when one's bold edits are not left in place.  So, in other words, both of you should read / review WP:BOLD. (I see no argument for an exception to BOLD.)

So, hopefully both sides will accept my opinions, and move on to edit on other topics within and without Eritrea.  There are points where I have agreed with each of you and points where I have disagreed with each of you (two each), and I believe I've been able to be fair and impartial.  Hope that helps.(t•c)",0.0

Obviously, Wikipedia is the encyclopedia only people with proprietary interest in an article can edit. You're part of the problem. Underwood had an effect on the church, or at bare minimum is an 'in-joke' therefore there should be mention of him in the article. I can see your mind is made up though, so I'll save my breath, there's no point having integrity when surrounded by folks determined to enforce their bias and other folks too busy to research the subject properly (it took you several minutes to research hundreds of posts and relationships between church members and Underwood). I'm done. Your arrogance is plain as day. I didn't claim to have made a perfect edit, I even suggested re-editing in the talk page. However Underwood's effect is plain as day, and as such should be mentioned. The reason I'm leery of the 'custodians' of the page is because in adding the Bob Black bombing I encountered the same kind of opposition. I'm not opposed to the Church, I just think that articles deserve more than custodial opinions by caretaker editors who have a vested interest in the outcome of the article. You were just in too big a hurry. I have a fair amount of experience editing, and know that a mention shouldn't require a full-on assault to accomplish when there is proof of association. I'm not trying to make the Church look guilty, just trying to keep accuracy on a topic that (if you research the Underwood article) often has been edited less than veraciously and is a continuously recurring discussion topic in alt.slack even 5 years after the murders.

"""I had a look through the section on theology and came across this: """"There is no original sin in Christian Science, no Trinity, virgin birth, miracles, resurrection or atonement ... no death, heaven or hell, or final judgment."""" Five of the statements are simply wrong. Mary Baker Eddy was an emphatic and orthodox believer in the virgin birth. She certainly believed in the resurrection and the atonement (there is a chapter on """"Atonement and Eucharist"""" in Science and Health). Heaven and hell are defined in the Glossary of the textbook, though they are understood differently in Christian Science than in mainstream Christianity. (It is true that CS does not adhere to the concept of miracles, seeing healing as a result of laws of nature that are not widely understood.) This section is so wrong that it really needs to be corrected in the interest of the accuracy of the article, whatever one might think of CS per se. I don't have time to root out academic sources on this so I suggest that it simply be removed. The over-riding concern is, surely to give an accurate picture of the topic.

The Decision to Come to America
We lived very nicely in Skala. We always had a servant and we had a new house that had just been built. We lived very nicely until the fire. Everybody tried to save their own property and it was windy and the fire spread all over the city. Our house didn't go because it wasn't directly in town. But all businesses and everything else went. [Maryam (Mary) Wiesenthal Brill]

After the fire, it was a time of great migration. [Usha (Dorothy) Wiesenthal Gross]
[Note: The """"Great Fire of Skala"""" is believed to have taken place in 1899.]

I came to America because my father didn't want I should become a soldier and eat not kosher stuff there in their army. My brother Sam came before me. He sent me the shiffskarte, ticket. And he sent me some money to come here and I paid him everything when I started to work. [Yankel (Jacob) Wiesenthal]

All the enterprising young men came, because they were poor and to escape the army. [Usha (Dorothy) Wiesenthal Brill]

I don't remember my father [who died when she was young]. My mother wanted to come, but only the three of us were left in Skala, my mother and Ada and me. My other sisters [who already were in America] couldn't afford to take us together. So I was the first one. I came just because Jake went [she accompanied her male cousin]; otherwise I wouldn't go. I was a teen-ager, thirteen or fourteen. I didn't want to come to America. I was crying. [Chana (Anna) Menchel]

We came because we couldn't make a living there. It would be a shame for the girls to go as maids in Skala. There was no way of making a living. [Hudya (Ada) Menchel] 

 
From Skala to Hamburg or Antwerp

7. Emigrants took the train from Skala We went by train, all the way from Skala to Hamburg. [Yankel (Jacob) Wiesenthal]
We got the boat in Antwerp. First we went by horse and buggy to some neighbors in another town and we stayed overnight there. And then we went by train to Antwerp. Another thing I remember, of course, we were third class and they stopped for a while for you to get water. There was no water on the train. So I remember my mother left us three kids on the train and she had a kettle and she went to get water and I nearly died. The others didn't know the difference. I felt sure the train was going to start without her. [Maryam (Mary) Wiesenthal Brill]
 

 
In Hamburg
We stayed overnight in Hamburg before we went on the ship. I remember I was really very young. I was a kid. And when we came to Hamburg, I was afraid. I only wanted to go to sleep with my cousin Jake. So he says to me, you can't go to sleep with me. Don't forget, you're a girl; I'm a man. You have to sleep with the girls. This I'll never forget. [Chana (Anna) Menchel] 
8. The emigration hall in Hamburg, early 20th century 

 
Aboard Ship

9. Aboard ship We were three children and we had one berth. All the four of us slept together in one berth. With our mother. You know how narrow those berths were. [Maryam (Mary) Wiesenthal Brill]
We were in an upper berth. And there was a very rabid Polish lady coming to America in the berth below. She probably didn't like it that there were four people above her and she started out with a real hatred of us. Anyway, one day I wet myself and some of it went through. So then the woman went to complain to the captain. And she said, """"Not only did this woman's child wet my bed, but she stole my best blouse."""" She accused my mother of stealing her blouse and they came and looked among my mother's possessions, but they didn't find it. [Usha (Dorothy) Wiesenthal Gross]

 

We came through steerage, of course. Somebody else was in the room with us and my mother said in Yiddish, I hope my daughter doesn't get sick. But I was very sick and so was my mother. [Hudya (Ada) Menchel]

 Do you know the superracist """"Sinanoglu Youth Movement"""" in Turkey? Do you know that some Wikipedia Users are doing valdalism by showing themselves as the advocates of the Five Pillars of Wikipedia ? 

Sinanoglu is not only a chemist, the """"moreover"""" and """"the"""" more important, he is the icon of the """"Turk Superracism"""". The person who is subject of that article (Oktay Sinanoglu) published autobiographical book in 2001 in Turkey by using the fake titles of the “World’s Youngest Professor”, “Lord of U.S.A”, “at the peak point of science in U.S.A”, “The Turkish Einsten” etc. so he gained a lot of prestige in Turkey and a few million Turkish student accepted him as their idol and having been believed the fake titles of Sinanoglu are exactly true they occured the “Sinanoglu Youth Movement”. The last ten year (2001 – 2011) Sinanoglu became the “Hero of People” by using these fake titles that he published them in his bestseller autobiographical book. Today, by contributing a few million college student, the “Sinanoglu Youth Movement” was like the superracist “Hitler Youth Movement” in Turkey and Sinanoglu became the icon of the """"Turk Superracism"""" everywhere. By reading the autobiographical book of Sinanoglu, large amount of college students became “superracist Turks” under the influence of Sinanoglu’s megalomanic and fake titles. So, they are conducting the election campaign: “Sinanoglu must be the President of The Republic of Turkey!” Eight years ago, the first edition of this article was written by some members of “Sinanoglu Youth Movement” as the summary of Sinanoglu’s autobiographical book and this Wikipedia article was used by them in Turkey as the proof that the titles of Sinanoglu had been accepted as exactly true by whole world, so every Turk must believe that this titles of Sinanoglu was exactly true. That was the begining and the developing of the """"Sinanoglu Youth Movement"""" in Turkey. Did you understand now why I was interested and why I am working to edit this article by using verifiable documents over 200 references? Please look at the edit history of the article. You will see a lot of vandal attacks to clean my editings. The last vandal attacks came from “Salvador21”-“Khazar2”-“Bobrayner” If you look at these users pages, you will see that these users are Turks and they are related with “Ottoman Empire” articles in wikipedia and they advocated “New-Ottomanist Imperialist Ideology” that Sinanoglu propagated this ideology in his autobiographic book. As a result, the some members of the superracist """"Sinanoglu Youth Movement"""" cleaned the all words of the article which is writen by me and they provided to put blockage to my editings by showing themselves advocates of the Wikipedia Five Pillars. The “Sinanoglu Youth Movement” are in joy that Wikipedia blocked my editings. And now, they sing a song: “Long Live the Five Pillars of Wikipedia!

That and other things are outlined at WP:TPG and help make sure things stay ordered. For content on the EAB page, there's a bit behind all those edits I made awhile back, so stick with me:

I realize a lot of stuff I condensed was your previous work, but right now everything seems to fit together well. The merging was mainly based on parsing things down, but also how we deal with scientific content at Wikipedia. It's definitely the ideal for Wikipedia articles in general that we summarize what the scientific consensus is on topics such as this. If you haven't already, I highly suggest reading WP:SCIRS, which gives a good outline on what we should be trying to do with scientific content. Essentially, we're striving to summarize what other reliable sources say for an encyclopedia. That means pulling from review articles since they do that for us. However, part of that is because we don't generally regard primary sources (i.e. research articles) as reliable because those are communications within the scientific community. That's because those articles are intended for other researchers to evaluate, and the general public (e.g. Wikipedia editors) are not qualified to assess whether the study was valid. For us as Wikipedia editors, we cannot assign what we call due WP:WEIGHT to an idea or specific study until it's put in context through other researchers commenting on it or giving it validity (e.g. review articles). Now an introduction section can count as a mini-review article, but we generally don't need that in this topic since we have a few review articles to pull from. 

With all that said, it is not our goal to describe what the primary research is. That's why I cut down a lot of the content as it was reading more like a journal than an encyclopedia (see WP:NOTJOURNAL). It's very different writing content for say an academic paper than it is for a Wikipedia article. From what I've gathered about your edits, you're very interested in generating very detailed information, which is perfectly normal for someone just getting their feet wet on scientific content here. However, the general goal of an encyclopedia is to have summarized information with references that lead to the more detailed information. A lot of the edits you're probably interested in including still largely fall under that question of due weight such as whether we even include the content or how much detail does it get. It's a learned skill, so I'm happy to explain things further at the EAB page is it's directly related or here if it's more general (i.e. Wikipedia's policies and guidelines) if you have questions or something isn't clear.

Hey  Kuru, 

There is  something really wrong with the administration of Wikipedia, and I am not the only one to know about and complains!.

For quite a while I had been hesitant but after a comment by a Polish Wikipedian I was finally encouraged to leave Polish Wikipedia (for some time only perhaps). I decided to move to the English Wikipedia for a change.

Although I am aware that  he (Kpjas)  have his  """"own problems"""" for some it might be a positive development!

I want to remind you that in US  at one time they needed to block the IP of US gov ... because  the politicians were polishing their resumes and were using the Wikipedia as they election platform!

You Have responded to  my  comments (in a way positively).

The problem is still that bunch of  administrators have  NO idea what the hell they  are talking about.

Please read my comments  and make  appropriate  corrections as  a shoddy  communist agent's tabloid operating the disinformation campaign shall NEVER  be called  a prominent newspaper!
You do not call a clochard a prince and prince a clochard!
There is to much crap like this specially  related to abuse by the polish administrators  who are  either  connected with the propaganda machine or are brain washed. 

As  an expert on many issues I believe that all  IPs  of some bloody idiots from  Poland should be banned for all other languages so we will have the real and unbiased by the people who do not understand what is Freedom, Liberty and Democracy and  vandalize the web pages with their totalitarian communist bias after being brain washed   since 1945 by several decades from generation to generation and educated by the communist teachers!

In my opinion, nobody is going to be able to write more than a paragraph of a encyclopedic quality description of """"love hate relationships"""" because the term is so straight forward. Thus, much of the article is either going to be trivia (examples of Love Hate Relationships in books and movies), which wikipedia discourages, or made up explanations of love hate relationships (what the article is now). An exception would be if somebody found some academic research that explores the properties of love hate relationships. Then we might have something to base an article upon.

Instead of it starting in 1914, it would be 1934.   So side point, we'd still be in the """"end times"""" if that's the case.    But again, not to digress too much, I was simply answering your question, even though I thought that the discussion was already over.   You were not sure what I meant by """"believed-to-be historical date"""" not just solely """"theological"""".   The WT believes it to be the accurate true date as a point of general history.  And because of the whole """"Gentile Times"""" thing (as you know of course) for the whole """"Messiah's Kingdom"""" breaking in for the """"end times"""" etc etc.    It's whatever.  I was addressing your question, that was it.  And yes, I noticed your addition in the other discussion, and your contention that they """"mis-translated"""" Jeremiah 25.29, when they didn't, because seeing other translations they say """"I begin"""" or """"I am beginning"""" it does NOT say what you said of """"already beginning"""".   There's no real difference between the word """"beginning"""" and """"start of"""".    THAT'S THE POINT.     It says """"I am starting off"""".   You could easily claim even with the NWT rendering that God """"already started off"""".   So?    Because in all versions the word """"already"""" is NOT there.   Whether you use the word """"beginning"""" or """"start"""".   Also, I'm a little confused as to what your point is, either way, wheether the words are """"already beginning"""" or """"first"""" or """"starting off"""".   Because if it's """"already beginning"""" as you said, wouldn't that ALSO be (obviously) before the other nations anyway?   The point is that all versions is obviously that Jerusalem would have evil caused by God to BEGIN with with, before the other nations.    Why would He say """"I am beginning with you"""" (as other versions have it, which makes the point too)?  Also, again, how does your """"already beginning"""" negate the point that Jerusalem would get it first?   Before other nations?     .........""",0.0

""":::Oooh, """"You're wrong! You're wrong! You're wrong!"""".  Why am I not impressed by your 'debate skills'. 
First, until 3 weeks ago, I had never heard the term, """"meat puppet"""".   Perhaps you're trying to make the term mean exactly what you want it to mean, no more and no less.  (Shades of Alice in Wonderland, I suppose.)  I will have to find the definition of that term.  But I view it as a problem when self-selected, biased individuals (even if there is no actual coordination involved) seem to coordinate their postings.  Dodo ran away, that's a fact.  He didn't address my actual criticisms of his actions:  he simply threw a few templates, as if that was the end of the argument.  (But, those templates were not merely mis-applied, they also did not address the entire subjects of the dispute.)  Dodo couldn't be bothered to address them, and for a 'good' (at least, for him!) reason:  If Dodo had to actually discuss his misconduct, and debate the propriety not merely of the original post, but also his own misdeeds, then Dodo would be so busy he couldn't continue his 'drive-by reversions' of peoples' articles.  Dodo was unwilling to explain why he deleted all of my edits, repeatedly.  He was unwilling to explain why he didn't wait for consensus.  Etc.
And, it is a fact that 'nobody' addressed Dodo's (at least arguable) misconduct, even if (hypothetically) they also objected to something I did, too.  Why should that be?  There's an 'excellent' reason:  I think the kind of people who did post (self-selected, of course, one would expect) may very well have felt they were defending 'one of their own'.  I repeat my point that if I had time (and access to reversion/deletion statistics) it would probably be obvious that those persons who felt the need to speak up generally engaged in a pattern of activity similar to that of Dodo: Revert, Revert, Revert!   And, not to bother with any 'consensus'.  (""""We don't need no stinkin' consensus!"""").  Such persons would be fearful of 'outing' Dodo's pattern of action, and similarly fearful of someday being hit with similar criticism.  Am I wrong?  I invite somebody else to study their statistics, and explain why there's no 'pattern' there.

I truly do not mean to be disrespectful to other members, but find that I see room for interpretation in many policies and...I'm finding that I have a problem with the jabs flying around. I hear what you are saying about the page not being the place to argue about the policies...but that seems to get folded into things when people can look at the very same words and see different things.
I am not ashamed to say that I am literally praying that this page does not get deleted. There was a huge impact here and I did take the time to read approximately 600-800 messages left to Ben on places like Legacy.om and on his Breedlove tv channel. It is not cliche stuff; it is real, poignant, and in many cases very specific examples of how he changed their lives. To me, it is also noteworthy when thousands of teenagers risk peer judgement to leave such messages.
This is a phenomenon that happens to fall within the category of something making things better. I hope that has a place in cultural history at Wikipedia.

You know, I think contributors on wp:en are a little bit naieve...
The reasons behind the fact that it is claimed these are not votes but discussions and that votes are not counted is to promote discussions above all (and that is good).
BUT when you arrive at the level of a """"proposal of deletion"""" or eg in the ArbCom process, people vote and then, the reason behing the fact it is claimed these are not vote but -again- discussion is to give the opportunity to admins to """"stop"""" a cabal or a group of power.
And in practice, given they are admins with all pov's, they have to """"count"""" the votes.

This lead to the following inconsistence  ArbCom suggest some editors would not have the right to edit these pages (given it is not a vote). How can it be good for the encyclopaedia to prevent people to give arguments explaining a matter ? Who is punished ? Them or the encyclopaedia...

The article says 

""""Sue Savage-Rumbaugh has observed Kanzi in communication to his sister. In this experiment, Kanzi was kept in a separate room of the Great Ape Project and shown some yogurt. Kanzi started vocalizing the word """"yogurt"""" in an unknown """"language""""; his sister, who could not see the yogurt, then pointed to the lexigram for yogurt.[5] """".

Now in this case, TG, there is a clear misrepresentation of the source, which reads 

""""In one experiment she described to me, she placed Kanzi and Panbanisha, his sister, in separate rooms where they could hear but not see each other. Through lexigrams, Savage-Rumbaugh explained to Kanzi that he would be given yogurt. He was then asked to communicate this information to Panbanisha.""""Kanzi vocalized, then Panbanisha vocalized in return and selected ‘yogurt’ on the keyboard in front of her,""""Savage-Rumbaugh tells me.""""

These accounts are substantially different, as you can see. 

In the source, S-R explains to Kanzi. through lexigrams, that he 'would be given' yogurt - in the article, he is 'shown' the yogurt.

In the source, Kanzi is asked to tell Panbanisha that he would be given yogurt, in the article he isn't.

In the source, Kanzi simply vocalizes; in the article, he vocalizes in an """"unknown 'language'"""".

Why is the wiki article simplified in this way ? Because the claims in the source are incredible. As far as I know, lexigrams do not include words such as 'would', so S-R can't tell Kanzi that he 'would' be given yogurt. Secondly, Kanzi is supposed to understand 3000 spoken English words (that's according to the wiki bonobo article, which references (guess what) the same Raffaele article we're talking about), so why does S-R need to use the lexigram at all ?

More importantly, both the article and the source refer to this 'experiment'. It would be nice to know the details of this experiment, which might describe how many objects Kanzi was shown, how often he vocalized, and how many times Panbanisha responded with accuracy, and so on.

I can't find this experiment. Tonight I contacted the Great Ape Trust, where S-R works with Kanzi, and asked for the reference. I'll let you know what they say. I'll leave off amending the article in the meantime.   """,0.0

 ==How it is - Answer== 

How it is

 He was a Romanian citizen
Not only Romanian! He was born a Austrian-Hungarian citizen (1913). He was a Soviet citizen too, for a long time, it is not clear if he ever got back the Romanian citizenship.

 He was a member of the PCR (thus a Romanian Communist)
... and of many other communist parties! No need to stress so much the romanian party. The romanian party was illegal at the time and it was considered a terrorist group; membership to such a URSS-sponsored group does not make """"Roman"""" Romanian. He was never a Romanian Communist; maybe you mean """"a member of the Party of the Communists from Romania"""".

 He lived in Romania
... and also in Spain, USSR, Czechoslovakia and France. Do not put undue stress on Romania.

Most of all, Neulander was a Soviet agent and comissar, ennemy of Romania, agent of occupation, whose mission was to establish communist rule in occupied Romania. Now stop spreading the anti-Romanian propaganda.  """,0.0

For example in the character and history sections you could make an interwiki link on the word Villain by doing this: [[Villain]] and it would produce Villain. To link to an article with a slightly different word for example you wanted villainous to link to villain you would put [[Villain|Villainous]] and this would link the word villainous to villain.

 Yes, I have played MGS3, I love that game, I am also quite partial to Greil (although I prefer to call him Gawain). Ashnard is quite like Volgin, but Ashnard isn't a bisexual pervert. So...Thanks for the comment, I'm really starting to get use to this place.  talk

    Wikipedians often make sweeping changes to pages in order to improve them - most of us aim to be bold when updating articles. While having large chunks of text you've written removed or substantially rewritten can be frustrating, simply making edits that noticeably alter the text or content of a pages should not be immediately labeled vandalism.

Talk page vandalism
    Removing the comments of other users from talk pages other than your own, aside from removing internal spam, vandalism, etc. is generally considered vandalism. Removing personal attacks is often considered legitimate, and it is considered acceptable to archive an overly long talk page by creating an archive page and moving the text from the main talk page there. The above rules do not apply to a user's own talk page, where this policy does not itself prohibit the removal and archival of comments at the user's discretion. Please note, though, that removing warnings from one's own talk page is often frowned upon.",0.0

Well, let's see. The first subchapter is §8.5 The Problem of Division by Zero. This he follows up with 8.7 Five approaches to Division by Zero, which I will repeat in its entirety. This will take more than one sitting to type in. The following is from Suppes 1957:163-169:
1 """"The first approach differs from the others in that it recommends a change in the baseic logic to deny meaning to expressions like: ¶ 1/0 = 1/0 ¶ Without attempting to characterize the basic changes necessary, we may still offer some general objections to this approach...."""" [more to follow tomorrow]
2 """"The second approach is to let x/0 be a real number, but to define division by the conditional definition stated in the last section: IF y≠0 Then x/y = z if and only if x = y*z. In this case for every number x, x/0 is a real number, but we are not able to prove what number it is. ¶ (2) 1/0 = 2/0 ¶ The inability to prove or disprove (2) is an argument against the second approach, since we want our axioms to be as complete as possible.""""
3 The third approach agrees with the second in making x/0 a real number, but it differes in making x/0 = 0 for all x. This eliminates the undecidability of statements like (2). For the third approach the appropriate definition of division is a proper definition similar to the axiom-free definition discussed at the end of §8.5:
 x/y = z ←→ [y ≠ 0 → x = y*z) & (y = 0 → z = 0)
 """"An advantage of the third approach is that it permits the definition of zero by a straight forward proper definition fully satisfying the criteria of elminability and non-creativity. The main disadvante of this appraoch is the one mentioned in §8.5: many mathematicians feel uneasy with the identity: ¶ x/0 = 0.
4 The forth approach agrees with the second and third in requiring no basic change of logic; it differes in not making it possible to prove that x/0 is a real number. The basic idea is to introduce a predicate 'R' which means 'is a real number.' Hypotheses using this predicate must be added to all the axioms stated in Chapter 7. Furthermore, to guarantee that addition and multiplication of numbers yield numbers, we must add the two closure axioms:
 R(x) & R(y) → R(x+y)
 R(x) & R(y) → R(x*y).
""""The introduction of the predicate 'R' widens our domain of individuals, for now it does not follow that everything in the domain is a real number (in particular the 1/0 is a real number). The indroduction of 'R' has the further consequence of making it natural to make all our definitions of arithmetical relations and operations conditional. There is no point in defining the realition of equal to or less than, for instance, for things which are not numbers. Thus we would ahve:
 [R(x) & R(y)] → [x ≤ y ←→ (x = y V x < y)].
""""The definition of division would be:
""""(3) [R(x) & R(y)& R(z) & y ≠ 0 ] → [x/y = z ←→ x = y*z].
""""If x is a real number, with (3) at hand we cannot prove:
""""x/0 is a real number
""""And we cannot prove:
""""x/0 is not a real number,
""""But we are not faced with the counterintuitive situation of being forced to call x/0 a real number. The situation can be improved by introducing into our system a primitive symbol for some object which is not a real number. Without saying what the object is, let us designate it by 'v'. They we have the axiom:
""""-R(v) [here - is ~ or bent bar, i.e. NOT]
""""that is, the assertion that v is not a real number. We may now definie division by:
""""(4) [R(x) & R(y)] → [x/y = z ←→ [y ≠ 0 → (R(z) & x = y*z)) & (y = 0 → z = v]].
""""The virtue of (4) is that it definitely places x/0 outside the domain of real numbers for any number x. Such a consequence would seem to be in closest accord with ordinary mathematical usage. Definition (4) also has the virtue of making
 x/0 = y/0 ,
""""Where x and y are real numbers, thus eliminating a vast proliferation of odd mathematical entities. On the other hand, to see once for all that all is not for the best in this best of all possible worlds, notice that if we adopt (4) we cannot decide whether or not v/v is a real number. If we use conditioncal dfinitions and insist on not tampering with the basic law of identity for therms, then we must be prepared for the undecidability of the statue so fentities like v/v. We make thake the attitude that everything is in good order in the domain where we intend to use the division operation, and we really do not care what is going on elsewhere if not inconsistencies can creap in.

"FrankTobia, I am sorry to say, but when you say the debt can be paid off you are, in fact wrong, because of one and only one thing, the application of interest by the federal reserve that is applied to the only money printed and in circulation. So that fact being true in all terms, The debt will never be able to be repaid to that which is the Federal Reserve Bank. If the debt were repaid, the money would cease to exist leaving no value in the monetary system. Frank, im sorry to say that the only banking book that is a valued resource is the book Modern Money Mechanics written in 1913 by the Federal Reserve Bank. Also, if you look at the shareholders of each Fed Bank they will all lead back to the same people, mostly located in Europe. By saying that the federal reserve bank/system does not work for profit, yet they apply interest to all loans derived from them as a source is really denying that you are credible in any way, and im not saying this as an insult, but the only reason of interest to be applied IS to make a PROFIT.

Anma seriously you really have some issues that need to be addressed. Although I have spoken to other editors, they have been professional and helpful whereas you have been incredibly insulting, plus your behavior is considered harassment (even if Wikipedia defines it differently, I know and trained in these matters and this does qualify, and at the end of the day that will overrule any website). Somehow you always seem to be on top of things should a change be made on the YCDTOTV page.

I'm sorry but you are behaving like a bully. You're right my comment was not a threat, but it is a warning not necessarily for Wikipedia but for the real world. At some point someone will put their foot down and say enough is enough this behavior is inappropriate and there will be consequences. You can't act like this it is called a power trip. Also think about it for a second if you look at our past disputes it normally is because I have made multiple changes on multiple pages, so maybe the Amyas """"update"""" was just a small snafu as I did not touch anything else.

Reply from ColonelHenry
I have been pissed this week, I admit. Why?
 First, last week, I get harassed by one hypocritical """"rule nazi"""" editor taking things too far (SummerPhD) so when I pointed out her similar shortcomings and intransigence and said frankly """"this user is an asshole"""" and explain why and state """"this is the kind of user that drives editors away from wikipedia"""" I get blocked for 24-hours.  I say """"asshole"""" once, I get blocked.  She calls me a """"dick"""" over a dozen times, and gets warned.  Go figure. I hate nitpicking rule nazis because they end up proving themselves to be hypocrites, and unfortunately without fool other meek fools who tend to be admins tend to side with the rule nazi.
 In the midst of that Daniel Case continued to plow ahead insisting on a rushed revision of ALONJ that no one else raised as a concern (so, not immediately dire) after being asked first politely and respectfully several times to """"wait until after TFA"""" and he still ignored it.  If someone politely asked me to wait a few days before doing a drastic edit on an article they worked on that was getting a little attention, I would...because I find it akin to telling a concert pianist to change their entire concert programme an hour before the recital. Only when I responded in anger did he pull back on the reins and realize """"hey, maybe I should wait till after TFA.""""  A little deference on his part would have gone a long way.  I'm not averse to his edits, but seriously, after TFA would have been more than fine.  I considered it insulting, and his refusal to listen to a polite request stated by both myself and the other major contributor to the article was considerably disrespectful.
 And then when the article I've worked on becomes TFA we get inundated with constant vandalism and petty edits that were not necessary (i.e. people like you, Kevjonesin, insisting on 19th instead of nineteenth).  Is that really a necessary place to make a stand and pick a fight? Seriously, don't you have better things to do with your time?  I'd rather argue over an analysis of Hegel's influence on Nietzsche's """"Will to Power"""" or Hindu mysticism in Eliot's Four Quartets than bicker about things as meaningless as whether honour should be spelled -or or -our.

As for why, I like """"nineteenth"""" as opposed to 19th, several style guides (including Chicago/Turabian) advocates it, and growing up I was taught that all numbers under 20 should be spelled out. Whether cutting two dozen letters from an article going to 19th and 20th is going to make a difference for """"brevity's sake"""" on a 40-page article, is a lame claim and frankly a waste of time for both of us. I like the aesthetic of it spelled out, it's allowed, and the option of spelling it out is a bonus in an article to avoid confusion with too many other numbers.  When considering such an unnecessary subjective edit, deference should be made to style set by the editors who spent months on an article...and when nothing is wrong to it, deference is entirely warranted.  That isn't ownership, it's just courtesy and good judgment. After all, if I stood in your yard while you were painting your house gray and proceeded to insist you to paint your house orange, you'd tell me to """"kick rocks.""""

The user citing copyrights from a musical sales chart, not knowing who added a reference, not being able to sign his comments, and mildly attacking everyone he encounters makes me believe that this is just another newcomer getting used to Wikipedia, and I don't see the need to protect an article for two weeks just because a new user's inability to understand Wikipedia policies.

An article in a 1981 issue of Military Police journal detailed the criminal careers of several National Lawyers Guild members as follows:

Bernardine Dohrn, the much sought Weather Underground fugitive, was named student director for the National Lawyers’ Guild in 1967.  

NLG member, Stephen Mitchell Bingham, is being sought by the state of California and the FBI for smuggling a .380 automatic pistol to George Jackson in prison...

...Guild member Frank Eugenio Martinez...was a Loyola law student who was active in NLG projects at the college and on the streets. Suspiciously, Frank’s fingerprints ended up on several of the eight letter-bombs mailed to Denver police officers in

I am quite baffled. I was merely making comments based on the general manual of style used in wikipedia which your article examples for Lincoln demonstrates. I have spent a great deal of time on wikipedia working on different topics and this is merely the general way of doing things. One can write an entire book simply on Atatürk's involvement on a single skirmish let alone war - it has a great amount of potential for growth than Atatürk's personal life. 
Bio articles aim to cover a persons general life while sub articles cover specific events or time frames in greater detail like George Washington: George Washington's early life (1732-1754) -> George Washington in the French and Indian War (1754–1758) -> George Washington between the wars (1758-1775) -> George Washington in the American Revolution (1775-1783) -> Presidency of George Washington (1783-1797) -> Post presidency George Washington#Retirement and death (1797-1799). Mind you that this is in the chronological order of the sections. Content of the articles do not overlap each other. The sub article you want to create for Atatürk covers his entire life.
I do not see what is there to compromise from all that. You are welcome to explain why you want a mirror bio article for Atatürk's entire life and I can reconsider my position.

How did you decide that bukkake always implies a female subject? 

Also, just because a word has a historical meaning doesn't mean that it can't ever mean anything else as culture develops. The word rap meant """"to knock, as on a door"""" up until the late 70s for example. Would you deny the more modern use of the term? The English language has no board to regulate it, as French does with the L'Académie française, so you have no basis for defining what the word means. We have groups and documents that define the proper use of words like """"you're"""" and """"your"""", for example, but none such for words like bukkake. If it can be shown that it is used in a particular way, that is valid. My personal belief is that there is no need for the qualifier """"gay"""", just as there is no need to call men having anal sex """"gay anal sex"""", but that's really irrelevent. 

I think it is important to make clear the historical implications, but not to deny that we are currently creating and modifying language. Even the fact that we have taken the word bukkake, """"splash"""", from Japan and created this very specific connotation of splashing not just anything, but specifically semen and specifically onto a person's face shows that this term is elastic and subject not to rules that we impose on it, but by the meaning that it has to the people who use it.

I did not say what you repeatedly say I said. You have several times now said I should be blocked for calling somebody a """"cunt"""". You have repeatedly made false accusations against me without a single time providing a diff. I am well aware of what I have written and where it was written. I have not called you or anybody else such a word anywhere on Wikipedia. The most outrageous thing in the diff in which you were blocked for was not your reference to """"cancer"""". It is your persistence in spreading false and malicious commentary about me. In that diff you say When Nableezy had the balls to say that he knew someone was a sockpuppet but that he was keeping his mouth shut because he likes him it showed that he was here for one reason and one reason only. Post a diff that backs that comment up. Just one, try to find one. Later on you say this time he called people cunts. Could you please provide a diff in which I call people (pl) cunts (pl) or even a person a cunt? Of course you cant, but that doesnt stop you. I dont even care if you are blocked or not, I wanted an admin to make you stop making these outrageous accusations without providing any evidence. Earlier you made several allusions to various people who think I was socking. You back out of it by saying """"Im not the one accusing you, just other unnamed people do"""", as if that allows you to drop such an accusation with out one bit of evidence.The other problems with your comment aside, the accusation that you made that I """"breed cancer"""", that cancer being sockpuppetry, shows only how obsessed you are with directing fault to me. You think I am the reason NoCal or Dajudem socks? Really? I, hoping that I am right, will assume you say this because you are just unaware of the actual history, as opposed to purposely ignoring or distorting it. Much of this happened before my time here, but before I got involved in editing here I read a quite a bit of the history, through article and user talk pages and archives, AfDs, ANI, AE, AN3, ..., and the arbitration cases. So I have a certain familiarity with the actors of this play and know the story fairly well. Once upon a time, there was a user named Isarig. This user has had their account """"vanished"""" to . Some things I dont know, as the user's talk page is deleted, and others dont need to be discussed, but this user vanished at the start of the ARBPIA case. The user already had a history of socking, how much is one of the things I dont know. This happened late 2007/early 2008, with his last edit talking place on Dec 24 2007. NoCal100 was created Jan 3 2008. Canadian Monkey Dec 30 2007. Mr Hicks The III is an older sock, from Sep 2007. There were a few others created back then. All this before this monstrous creature you refer to as Nableezy arrived and caused this man to start socking.Now, as for your BFF (Stellarkid). The account Dajudem was given a topic ban after the CAMERA lobbying issue came to light in April 2008. One month later the Tundrabuggy account was created. One of the first things this account did was to go after, in a purely vindictive manner, one of the admins who had dealt with that issue. She, dishonestly posing as a new editor confused by the rules, was able to game the system into producing several blocks or bans against that admin. She followed him from article to article, going away from the A/I area into random areas such as Persian history. She was able to hide the fact that she was doing this for some time, until she was discovered as Dajudem's sock and blocked. One month later, a new account, Stellarkid, is created. Posing as a new account confused by the rules, this new sock proceeds to do the same thing she did with that earlier admin with a new target (guess who?). She is able to successfully get a ban placed against her target. When this account is discovered to be a sock, a new account (in fact several) was created. Three separate accounts were blocked last time around, including one with no edits just waiting to be put in to use. So Dajudem began socking prior to ever seeing me, yet I am responsible for her continued socking? And NoCal? I am responsible for dozen or so different accounts that I know that he has, and that isnt counting the ones from Isarig? How can you possibly blame me for the fact that a number of die hard members of the Defenders of the Glorious Cause have repeatedly socked?But back to the point, dont make accusations that you cant provide evidence for. Either provide a diff of me calling somebody a """"cunt"""" or retract the charge.

"Droop is not better than Hagenbach-Bischoff!!! 

Okay suppose we have an instant runoff election, where we have 50 votes with Party-A as first preference and Party-B as second preference. We also have 50 votes with Party-B as first preference and Party-A as second preference.

Using the Hagenbach-Bischoff quota of 50, both parties reach quota, and there is a tie.

Using the Droop Quota of 51, neither party reaches the quota, but as they have the same number of first preference votes, neither can be eliminated; and we have a tie anyway.

So using the Droop Quota does not eliminate ties. It is a much more ugly formula, and has the property that parties with majority support, can recieve a minority of seats.

"The article, 'Castles', may exist, but the author is stubborn about allowing users to add accurate info and is bias against certain regions of Europe. The author seems discriminatory against certain info. I find this not in keeping with wiki's universal policy. I had no choice but to create an modified article. For example, a particular castle in Spain is now called, 'King Charles V's Castle'. The old and unused name of the castle is, 'Alcázar of Segovia'. Everyone in Spain calls this castle by, 'King Charles V's Castle', not 'Alcazar of Segovia'. The author refuses to accept this fact, though I provided solid sources supporting this historic truth. The author is biased against Spanish historical inferences for reasons I have yet to understand. He is not flexible. If he can remove his biasness, and allow me to add my info backed by sources, then I will not create a new article.

Speedy deletion of Unholy Force
 A tag has been placed on Unholy Force requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a band, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for musical topics. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.  ѧ  """,0.0

Perhaps if you took the time to review what I've had to deal with, you might understand why I am in the mood I am in. So far, my experience of Wikipedia has been anything but one of collaboration. At various times and by various people, I have been completely ignored, I have been told I am or I do things I provably do not, I have been told provably false things about what Wikipedia's rules supposedly say, and I have had to endure several people telling me all about a subject they clearly know absolutely nothing about, to the point where they are making quite ridiculous claims about how long it would take to write an article to their satisfaction (and obviously, the two of those are linked - people who know nothing about the subject or the media that covers it, aren't likely to have the first clue how long it would take to find and summarise that media, are they?). Apparently though, judging by the fact none of that has attracted any warnings for their conduct, I suppose all of this is completely normal here, and it's just me who is in the wrong for complaining about any of this by referring to people's actual names. So be it I guess. I'm struggling to see how me slowing down is going to change that. It appears to be hard-wired behaviour. I'm afraid that what you may or may not appreciate is that people like Dave are always going to feel insulted when the truth is told - when it's pointed out to them that the facts tell quite a different story about whether or not their claim to be a """"bus enthusiast"""" are remotely true - or when it's pointed out that their claim to have """"literally"""" found no results on Google doesn't stand up to basic scrutiny. Similarly, people like Charles, who are quite clearly only interested in trolling and annoying people, will always act like jerks whenever people follow up their 'reading advice' with questions which expose the fact that their advice appears to be based on nothing contained in the reading material at all. I'm really not sure why any of this needs to actually be raised at an administrator's 'noticeboard' before any notice of it is actually taken. Laziness/disinterest is all I can think of. There certainly seems to be a complete disinterest about the fact articles like NIBS are disappearing from Wikipedia based on absolutely nothing, certainly nothing that subject experts would agree was good reasoning. Still, this is all now being swept under the carpet because of the perfectly normal behaviour on Wikipedia - don't like what the other guy says? Ignore him and he'll go away. If he doesn't go away, complain loudly (and in a completely hypocritical manner in the case of Dave) in the hope someone gets rid of him for you.

"""== Purges in the Red Army ==

The late 1930s saw the so-called """"Purges of the Red Army cadres"""", occurring against the historical background of the Great Purge. The Purges had the objective of cleansing the Red Army of the """"politically unreliable element"""", mainly among the higher-ranking officers. This inevitably provided a convenient pretext for settling personal vendettas and eventually resulted in a witch hunt. Some observers believe that the Purges weakened the Red Army considerably, but this remains a hotly debated subject. Many commentators overlook the fact that the Red Army grew significantly in numbers during the peak of the Purges. In 1937, the Red Army numbered around 1.3 million, and it grew to almost three times that number by June 1941. This necessitated quick promotion of junior officers, often despite their lack of experience or training, with obvious grave implications. In another important consideration, by the end of the Purges the pendulum swung back, restoring and promoting many of the purged officers.

Recently declassified data indicate that in 1937, during the culmination of the Purges, the Red Army had 114,300 officers, of whom 11,034 suffered repression and did not gain rehabilitation until 1940. Yet, in 1938, the Red Army had 179,000 officers (56% more compared to 1937), of whom a further 6,742 suffered repression and did not gain rehabilitation until 1940

In the highest echelons of the Red Army the Purges removed 3 of 5 marshals, 13 of 15 army generals, 8 of 9 admirals, 50 of 57 army corps generals, 154 out of 186 division generals, 16 of 16 army commissars, and 25 of 28 army corps commissars.

Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.

As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.

The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.

It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.

The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.

No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.

I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as she slept.",0.42857142857142855

It depends whether we want Wikipedia to be cutting-edge. It is clear to anyone studying Time Cube that Dr Ray's discovery of the Ineffable 4-Corner Truth renders him worthy of the positions of Greatest Thinker and Wisest Human; he is thus granted the authority to bestow a doctorate upon himself. The only reason not to recognise this doctorate is compliance with the general stupidity that has precluded rapid acceptance of Time Cube.

Well, I myself am not so keen on dumbing down Wikipedia for the stupid and closed-minded people; although some people do seem to be, as evidenced by the censorship of the following material:

In late 2004, and in the midst of a prolific period of Time Cube evaluation marked by his creation of new and inspirational Cubic scriptures, Dr Ray took the Cubic disproof of religious concepts to the next level, by solving the major philosophical question: """"Why something rather than nothing?"""" The answer, as published by him on his Time Cube website, related to the principle of opposites (in this case, static rather than dynamic/cyclical opposites), an important element of Cubic geometry: """"Between the opposites, all things are created. As an entity, they exist only as a big zero, seen from space as something and nothing from every possible view.""""

It appears that the religious zealots want there to be a lack of solution for """"Why something rather than nothing?"""", so that they can use it as a proselytisation/brainwashing tactic. Thus, when the solution is revealed, they cover it up as part of their efforts to prevent awareness of the Cubic Truth, which, as we know, disproves God and exposes religion as an evil Word-scam. 

It seems a pity, but in reality, great things don't come easy. We must all fight to break the Word-shackles of religious and Academic-induced 1-corner ignorance, and force teachers to teach Cubicism above evil cubelessness. Humanity's sole hope of salvation lies with 4-corner Cubic knowledge.""",0.0

Let Define what is WP:COI and who falls under this tag

For starters, the Education section, in the form that BenBurch is pushing is WP:POV as well as WP:GRAPEVINE and is clearly hearsay and with any read of the cites,

Speedy deletion of Ashish (Ash) Bhardwaj
 A tag has been placed on Ashish (Ash) Bhardwaj requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

 Comments from RHB 

I am approaching this as someone who knows very little about the subject. I will give some high-level comments mainly on structure and content. There are copyediting and prose issues as well, but it is probably worthwhile to tackle the general problems before going into specifics. Before I start, one general point that you will see often in my comments is that there are at times new subjects that are suddenly introduced. Although wikilinks help, a clause or a few words of explanation would smooth the flow of reading for a person not familiar with the subject.

Background to the mission
This section seems a little long relative to the rest of the article. Unless there is a significant expansion planned for the rest of the article, I would recommend reducing this section. There are small details that do not add very much to the Augustine story, e.g., the origin of St Martin’s Church, the fair-haired slaves theory, the pope writing to various kings.
Bede is suddenly introduced without explanation.

Arrival and first efforts
The mission turning back to Rome is not explained. Is there a significance to what happened?
It says “…on the one hand… on the other hand…” but the two items mentioned do not seem to be in opposition as expected when this phrasing is used.
Augustine established first at Canterbury. Since he was the originator, it might be good to give a reason why he chose the location.
The Archbishop of Arles is suddenly introduced. Who is he? Was he based in Arles (in modern-day France) or in Kent? The existence of an Archbishop implies a significant Christian population existing on British soil. This then brings more questions to mind.
It says """"That Christmas…"""". But what year is that?
The king became a saint after his death, but the sentence may be in the wrong place. Did the king die shortly after Augustine's arrival?
In the same paragraph, some information of the existence of Christians before Augustine's arrival is given. This info should go before the discussion of Augustine's arrival.
Mellitus and Justus are suddenly introduced without explanation.
The sentence """"A theory by the historian S. Brechter…"""" is either a run-on sentence or is incomplete.

Additional work
After the first sentence describing the two episcopal sees, there is a sudden jump to after 1066 and a discussion of a cathedral. How are they linked? Also what cathedral is it? The description of the archeology seems out of place in the """"Additional work"""" section. Is it meant to show that Augustine managed to build new churches?
If Aethelbert was only the King of Kent, how was he able to summon bishops outside his realm?
There is a sudden introduction of the tonsure.

Further success
Concerning """"temples and usages"""" is that """"temples and their use""""? The """"former… latter"""" construct does not work very well here.
Concerning the quote """"whoever wishes…"""", who said that?

I would recommend reading the article out loud. I think you will find some sentence structures that seem a bit complex or difficult to understand. Following the corrections, a good copyedit/prose check is needed. I give as an example, the sentence """"As to why Pope Gregory…"""" could be made better as in """"Nothing is mentioned in the sources on why Pope Gregory chose a monk to head the mission"""".

I hope this has been helpful.   """,0.0

 Hi . Wikipedia has a strict policy on how we write about living people. Wikipedia is one of the top 5 websites on the planet—if someone types anything in Google, Wikipedia will almost certainly be on the first page of results if we have an article about it. As a result, we have to pay special attention to living people. Anything we write about them can actually harm them in real life if it isn't backed up by high-quality reliable sources. In other words, we need to get the article right. And one important policy we have is that any poorly sourced negative information about living people should be removed. Next time, you need to back up your content with reliable sources—see Wikipedia:Citing sources and Wikipedia:Referencing for beginners for how to do this. We thank you for your interest in contributing to Wikipedia, however. Check out our introduction to editing for more information on how you can contribute constructively.   """,0.0

Dennis, why don't you just go back and put that article THE WAY I HAD IT ?! 

1) There *was* an explanation posted along with the change
2) In the United States, if something is not specifically prohibited, then it is LEGAL.

Therefore, Motorcycle Safety Author Pat Hahn is full of shit. Lane splitting is NOT a """"grey area."""" It is LEGAL, as described by the California Department of Motor Vehicles HERE 

http://apps.dmv.ca.gov/pubs/hdbk//shr_slow_veh.htm

""""Motorcycles may travel faster than traffic during congested road conditions and can legally travel in the unused space between two lines of moving or stationary vehicles; this is commonly called """"lane splitting."""" """"

Problematic edit
These edits removed a link to plate lunch from the caption of an image of a plate lunch, asserts a claim that there are 5 distinct styles of cuisine in Hawaii, makes the claim that Christian missionaries introduced New England cuisine, but I am not seeing a source for this assertion or the one about whalers introducing salted fish. The phrase this blend of Eastern and Western cuisine formed a """"local food"""" was added. What is meant by """"Eastern and Western"""" cuisine? This is highly unencyclopedic overgeneralized language. What is Eastern cuisine? Western cuisine? The new wording also refers to char siu bao as a """"new ethnic food"""". It is not a new ethnic food it was an existing Chinese dish that was introduced and acquired a pidgin name. The historic image of Hawaii pineapple packing, loco moco, and lomi salmon were removed. These are all inconic and significant illustration of Hawaii's cuisine, unlike the hotel image that shows architecture of one of many hotel where European cuisine was served.

Hello 

I've noticed that you have added info that Čedomir Jovanović is of Roma origin. As far as I know this information is false and this article has already been locked once because of one user persistently inserting claim that he is of Roma origin. If you can provide evidence for your claims I would be more than happy to allow it to stay, but since I am from Serbia and know guy quite well I do not believe it, at least without some proof. I have nothing against Roma people but in a same way you can say that he is a Swede. It is baseless. So, I've removed it from an article. I hope you understand.

All the best 

Thanks for the answer. I apologies in any case for not studying the changes thoroughly but since last vandalism string we had was pretty relentless I wanted to react quickly. You can see discussion page for more details. By the way I would ask you for a favor. Since Wikipedia article you have listed states he is a of Roma origin can you ask that user to provide you a source and if he does that you pass it over to me. Thanks. If not I hope that you will as a decent Wikipedia user you are amend the article to exclude unchecked and if you believe me baseless informations. Thanks   TAB

"""::: Simple solution. Rename the article to """"Dhimmi, according to Bat Ye'or and Bernard Lewis"""". The article is overburdened with the views of a handful of orientalists. In addition to that, as Tony points out, the article is effectively a series of polemic statements deriding the historic practices that occured under the Dhimmi system. If this article isn't a commentary (and POV-driven indictment) on history, then there's the burden to prove that Shariah as practiced today also supports the kinds of restrictions on dhimma that the article claims it to. Sections discussing history should make it clear that their content is historical, and should not contrast events and policies practiced in the 8th or 10th century with standards we accept today. Sections dealing with contemporary usage of dhimma in countries that run under Shariah should make it clear what aspects of the dhimmi system are still being practiced.

"Reverting other editors 

Hi there!
You appear to be engaged in an edit war with one or more editors according to your reverts at Alien (creature in Alien franchise). Although repeatedly reverting or undoing another editor's contributions may seem necessary to protect your preferred version of a page, on Wikipedia this is usually seen as obstructing the normal editing process, and often creates animosity between editors. Instead of edit warring, please discuss the situation with the editor(s) involved and try to reach a consensus on the talk page.

If editors continue to revert to their preferred version they are likely to be blocked from editing. This isn't done to punish an editor, but to prevent the disruption caused by edit warring. In particular, editors should be aware of the three-revert rule, which says that an editor must not perform more than three reverts on a single page within a 24-hour period. While edit warring on Wikipedia is not acceptable in any amount, breaking the three-revert rule is very likely to lead to a block.

Please be informed that a  Dispute resolution has been filed on this page, and further edits should be kept to the talk page until it is resolved.

Thanks! And have a wonderful time on wikipedia.",0.0

Please note that I was removing brochure language right up to the lock-up of the article.  There's still lots more in there that needs to come out before the advert tag should be removed.

 NPOV required  

The article seems to me to lean more towards an """"heroic"""" account of the war than an encyclopedic piece seeking a NPOV.  
For instance the opening sentences of the section Soviet–Finnish relations and politics: 
""""After the Soviet involvement in the Finnish Civil War in 1918, no formal peace treaty was signed. In 1918 and 1919, Finnish volunteer forces conducted two unsuccessful military incursions across the Russian border""""
The Finnish doctrine is embedded in its first sentence, tying """"Soviet involvement"""" in the Civil War  with the idea that it necessitated a """"peace treaty"""", and then using this muddled logic as if it were an a priori justification for Finnish military incursions into Russia. (Russian involvement was perhaps half that of the German involvement and both together accounted for about 10% of the protagonists. 35% more Finns died in the Civil War than in the Winter War)
Orthodox Finnish doctrine riddles the article, even though it contains all the information needed for an NPOV.  The account of Finnish independence for instance fails to mention that the Boshevik's policy was to grant autonomy, stating the event in heroic terms instead: 
""""The outbreak of the First World War and the collapse of the Russian Empire gave Finland a window of opportunity; on 6 December 1917, the Senate of Finland declared the nation's independence.""""
Knowing the Boshevik's policy makes such doctrinal heroism ring hollow.
To go through the article and cite every example of the bias and absence of references would take far too long but perhaps one or two more from various angles may make the point clearer. 
The article states: 
""""the Soviet Union changed its foreign policy toward Finland in the late 1930s. The Soviet Union began pursuing the reconquest of the provinces of Tsarist Russia"""".
Both parts of this need substantive verifiable reference(s).  What was this change? What form did it take? In what way can it be said that the new Russia was """"pursuing reconquest""""?  Is such a characterisation neutral?  The whole requires contextualisation as history is not a simple cause effect nil sum comic strip equation and there are many drivers for any situation.  In this case the pivotal role of the economic and political policies of the West towards the revolution in Russia (as previously towards the French revolution) need to be plainly set out.  However, from the implied assertions the article segues into a distortion of what would be the core issue imo for an NPOV article: 
""""The Soviet leadership believed that the old empire had ideal security and territorial possessions, and wanted the newly christened city of Leningrad to enjoy a similar security."""".
The """"old empire"""" is implied as being the driver rather than any legitimate security concern even though these concerns are in fact detailed afterwards.  
It seems to me that the key aspect in understanding any of this is the socio-political concept of buffer states.  Again, the article contains all the information required.  It is just that it is presented in a non-NPOV form, and so ends up in the good guy/bad guy shoot out at the OK Corral story of the Finnish doctrine.  
I believe that in the West, the establishment treated Finland as a buffer state, one that stood between it and the influence of the new socialism/communism.  I believe that Finland enjoyed the consequent economic benefits that flowed from this status, and which ended recently with the end of the Cold War.  
When all these things are included and made overt, again adding nothing into the article, the following paragraphs can be seen as the key to understanding how the war broke out.
""""In April 1938, an NKVD agent, Boris Yartsev contacted the Finnish foreign minister Rudolf Holsti and Prime Minister Aimo Cajander, stating that the Soviet Union did not trust Germany and that war was considered possible between the two countries. The Red Army would not wait passively behind the border but would rather """"advance to meet the enemy."""" Finnish representatives assured Yartsev that Finland was committed to a policy of neutrality and that the country would resist any armed incursion. Yartsev suggested that Finland cede or lease some islands in the Gulf of Finland along the seaward approaches to Leningrad. Finland refused.   
Notwithstanding what was said at the time, history, in the simplest manner, seems to me to record its verdict on the two parties positions.  Finland's behaviour during WW2 merited her having to pay war reparations.  Russia's assessment of Finland's true position (and intent?) was vindicated.   
In my opinion the NPOV could easily be resolved by some rebalancing of the introduction and by atte",0.0

One night in an online coffee house, a self-ordained Zen Master named Moulton said to him, """"Go to the dilapidated mansion you will find at the URL which I have written down for you.  Do not speak to those who dwell there; you must remain silent until the Moonbeam's students arise.  Go to the large parlor on the right of the main hallway, sit in the lotus position on top of the rubble in the northeast corner, stand humbly in the corner, and meditate.""""

He did just as the Moultonic Zen Master instructed. His meditation was frequently interrupted by worries, anxieties, and the occasional Bombesin rush.  He worried whether or not the rest of the plumbing fixtures would tumble from the second floor toilet to join the pipes and other debris he was sitting on. He worried how would he know when Moonbeam's students arose for their next blogfest on Ethics in Journalism.  He worried about what the people who walked through the room said about him.  Man, I tell you, this guy had spilkes.

His worrying and meditation were disturbed when, as if in a test of his faith, courage, and personal integrity, Moulton's provocative responses fell from the upper stories onto him.  At that time two Wikipedia editors blithely sauntered into the scene.  The first asked the second who the man was sitting there was.  The second replied """"Some say he is a holy man. Others say he is a shithead."""" 

Hearing this, the troubled young man became enlightened, if only for a brief instant of cosmic time.

Thank you for reverting all of  Rainbow Sneakers 

I requested a check user, and I've found Po132 and Minun132 are the same person and Iloveminun and PokemonFan are the same person. What should I do now?  Rainbow Sneakers 

PokemonFan was used vote in a controversial TfD after Iloveminun (who nominated the template) got told to stop voting delete. PokemonFan also vandalised the user page of the admin taking part in the vote who wouldn't delete it for him. It's more of a larger problem by Iloveminun, who is trying to replace Serebii, a valued and incredibly useful website most of the actually reference, from hundreds of Pokémon articles (first he tried to remove the template that links to it manually, then from the template that produces references in all the Pokémon articles and replace it with his own website, Pokémon Galaxy. Pokémon Galaxy is not at present even finished, but it seems to be pushing it. Which is how I got caught in everything. (Bit odd how I caught the real sockpuppet when I was originally way off) Thanks,  Rainbow Sneakers 

I will. Is Minun132 being abusive? Hmm, I had missed that. Thank you for the offer, I will wait for your return since this is a new situation for me. Thanks again,  Rainbow Sneakers 

Nah, I'm writing I'm just ill. And getting sidetracked. It's nearly done. Cheers,  Rainbow Sneakers

Instead, in the two and fro of the last few weeks as Aesop has gone back and forth between the Queen's English and CE/BCE, Mzilikazi and his friends have claimed that the comments much further up this talk page and dated 20 months ago constitute the necessary discussion and consensus for the change of 26/01/14. Apart from the obvious fact that the article remained in the standard English state for 20 months continuously (May 2012 to January 2014), those comments were never enough to justify the change to CE/BCE even back then. This is of course because, as mentioned earlier, WP:ERA requires that article-specific reasons be given and consensus established. Neither occured then. What we see from 2012 can at best be called a disgrace; it was merely Dougweller and his friends making the laughably fallacious and tendentious claim that because there were more of them, they should automatically get their way without having to justify their case or convince anyone of it. The """"discussion"""" went quiet in its unresolved state and the change from the Queen's English (which the article has used since its creation and the overwhelming majority of the time since then) to CE/BCE therefore didn't proceed, at least until 20 months later when Mzilikazi decided to try again, this time without any attempt to follow the proper procedure.

If Mzilikazi and his friends want to legitimately change Aesop from the established English language abbreviations to CE/BCE then by all means discuss it here and follow the proper process. Stop trying to ram through your illegal change with constant back and forth editing. (  )""",0.0

Thanks again , the mid-19th century embellishing has been sort of attributed to John Elkington Gill, but that seems to be based on no more the fact that he worked on the nearby parish church.

If there's any clues, they are in that strange tower, which is why I likened it to the work of Alexander Thomson, but that's more for explaining to readers the ideas and architectural concepts that were floating about at that time, rather than suggesting he designed it - it's not accomplished enough for him anyway.

Codex, p. 60
I will give the specific quote from the original text, which appears to be slightly changed []:

Τον ευλογημένον Ζαχαρίαν τον διεδέχθη ο Άγιος Γεννάδιος. Ύτος ήτο Σμυρναίος και αυτός αρχιδιάκονος του Ιωαννίνων, νέος τη ηλικία δεν είχεν ευχαρίστησιν να ακούη χριστιανούς να ομιλούν την αλβανική γλώσσαν. Φιλοδίκαιος όλως πολλά. Αρχιεράτευσε χρόνους είκοσι πέντε. Έπειτα μην υποφέρων την αλβανικήν γλώσσα εις τα χωρία της επαρχίας του ευχαρίστως έκαμε την παραίτησιν και αφήσας...

The text added in the article translates this entry as: In an ecclesiastical entry .... noted that some of the Christian Greek clergy had linguistic difficulties in administrating to their congregation, as Christian villagers living within the region of Delvinë were Albanian speaking.

It's hardly enough from the original text to conclude that the villagers were in general monolinguals, indeed it claims that Albanian speech was present and in significant numbers (it doesn't also conclude that all villages were Albanian speaking). Moreover, the fact that this produced linguistic difficulties in eclessiastical administration is something that only indirectly can be concluded, since the Codex mentions that """"a specific bishop, who came from Smyrna, found it not pleasant to hear his flock speaking Albanian, beacause of the Albanian speaking villages in  his periphery, and resigned after 25 years of local service.""""

It was not a personal attack, but rather a racist remark about Indians in general. No, I did not accuse Anir1uph of being unfamiliar with the English language because he is Indian, his nationality was irrelevant. Anir1uph showed failure to use the English language correctly, common practice among non-native English speakers. I am fed up with uneducated third world citizens who edit Wikipedia according to their own POV. Anir1uph is a pretentious editor and forms fart of a larger Indian demographic who subtly edit Wikipedia pushing their own POV, using weasel words and do not adhere to consensus. There is a growing concern among a considerable number of White Western editors that due to the increased availability of computers and the internet around the world - the number of uneducated third world citizens with a POV agenda to their edits is rising rapidly. Nationalism is a large factor in this and it isn't healthy for the Wikipedia community. There is an ongoing clash of culture and outlooks, Asians view the world differently than Europeans and North Americans. In my opinion the sooner editors are restricted to editing Wikipedia in their native tongue the better. 

I will hold my hands up for my disliking of India and the Indian population, I have a ferocious and bitter attitude towards them, but not hatred. I pity India and its misfortune - 5,000 Children die every day in India under the age of 5, how sad.

Speedy deletion of Lucinda Scala Quinn
 A tag has been placed on Lucinda Scala Quinn requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. —  (talk)  """,0.0

One of the things that make the show unique is that it is a comedy aimed at more than just kids, that doesn't revolve around a cliched 'loser' main character. In fact KP is the complete antithesis of a loser and so are her family and most of her friends. Even Ron doesn't really fit the stereotype.

Just curious why you think material in Wikipedia is """"leading to death threats and other hate-crime related events""""? The material is widely proliferated - a quick Google search turns up hundreds of pages, including references in SPIN, CMJ, and Vibe magazines.  Having the material here would seem to be minor compared to those nationally published magazines.
Furthermore, if Jordana wishes to have the material removed, there is a process she can follow to have that done. If you are not she, then you are going against consensus by removing the properly sourced material.

The tide of opinion is moving against AGW,  and certainly against CO2, being particularly potent cause of climate change.    
Rather than surveying scientists, look at the fundamentals.  Effects of water are dominant over CO2.   I’m told that IPCC models apply controversial positive feedback factors to enhance the effect of CO2, and using values that are too high would explain why their models do not fit recent observations.  Illustrative links follow: -

Water vapour dominates.
http://timeforchange.org/radiation-wavelength-and-greenhouse-effect
Beyond thst, clouds complicate the effects of water, which in a complete study needs to be considered in its three phases.

However, global mean temperature does not correlate with atmospheric CO2 concentration on a geological time scale:

nor using accurate modern data:

You don’t have to accept the above graphs.  You can do your own research.  However, I expect that you will find that that they do illustrate the points succinctly and that you will confirm them.

it is inarguable you're trying to improve the exposure lesser-known bands, whose musical merits are FAR inferior to Elton John's. That is not how music works. I have never ever seen someone post cover art of covering artists' album. it is unheard of and rude. it is the only page for which i have ever seen this, and clearly it is your prerogative to promote Ben Folds and other horrible bands.
The bottom line is that Elton John is a LEGEND, and I think what you're doing is no different than someone posting cover art for a boyband cover of a Beatles song; you would be eviscerated if you did something like that for a Beatles single, and I don't see why such evisceration should be spared when you're insulting arguably one of the best musicians in the past 50 years. Do not argue about whether this is an encyclopedia, argue the merit for why the cover art of inferior artists whose musical merit is far far far below that of the ORIGINAL artist. You can't, because you know they are inferior. instead you're using a BS """"freedom of information"""" argument to ruin the appeal of a great song. No one covers a song better than the original artist. For example: Oasis' cover of Street Fighting Man is unbelievable, but I would NEVER EVER go to the Rolling Stones' """"Street Fighting Man"""" single page and post Oasis' cover art, even though their merit is much closer to the Stones than Ben Folds is to Elton John.

As a nonspecialist in this field, I'm wondering if anyone can explain the information presented in section starting on p.2, From The Countries Viewpoint of this source EllenCT posted. 
Although the source is arguing for more funding for vocational programs as opposed to liberal arts in light of much greater overall ROI, in order to make its case it presents ROI stats for both, and to a novice like me it seems that the stats may support the statement pertaining to ROI from subsidies in terms of tax receipts. 
In short, the table shows an ROI of 30%/yr (""""BA in English""""), and though I'm not exactly sure how that translates, given the inclusion of """"incremental jobs"""" and """"incremental income"""", etc., it does seem to represent some correlation between the subsidies and tax returns.

"""

I have a lot of sympathies for Mergism, but in this case, it's a bit tricky. A Structurist solution might be better here. I would rather see less content and more disambiguation and sectioning on this page, with """"Main article: ..."""" just under the heading of each section. What I don't like about this page is that it favors the set-theoretic/algebraic usage of kernel a bit too much over the other uses, such as the integral transform or statistical usages.

Although the set-theoretic usage is more general than the algebraic, it is not the case that someone trying to understand the notion in group theory or ring theory for the first time really needs the set-theoretic version. Usually, """"preimage of the neutral element"""" will do. From this point of view, kernel_(algebra) is OK, although still a bit too chatty, particularly in the """"General Case"""" section. (The """"Mal'cev algebra"""" section needs help because of the redlinks.) It also underplays the category theory notion too much compared to the universal algebra notion. Again, I think that page could be improved with better sectioning. 

Null space is very problematic. It is claimed on that page that some people use both that term and the term kernel to denote the zero set of an operator, where the latter term is used in its broadest, possibly nonlinear, sense. That coincides with the algebraic version only in the case of linear operators, i.e., linear transformations. I confess I have never seen either null space or kernel used synonymously with zero set, but have only seem the terms used in the algebraic (or in the case of kernel, set-theoretic) senses. Maybe I live in a bubble. If kernel really is used sometimes in this rather weak sense, then this page needs a brief mention of it. Again, the page Null space itself is rather unstructured. Better sectioning could probably fix it.

Hmm. That makes three times I mentioned better sectioning. Maybe I really am a Structurist.

Rock or pop?
I know it says rock and roll here, but the red album really does sound very teeny-popish. My music collection only has room for single genres (as in rock or pop, not rock/pop), so which one is it really?  

It's rock  

Actully, it is pop not rock. I aggree with  that it sounds very teeny-popish. Rock and roll is the same thing as rock. I think a lot of people shorten it as it sounds a bit cooler.  | I will respond.  

 Many problems 

In addition to three items I tagged as  that appear to contradict what I can verify about the album, the table smacks of OR, and even then, some of the info in the table is incorrect.

As far as I can determine, both 1962-1966 and 1967-1970 were compiled by Allan Steckler, an employee of ABKCO (Allen Klein's company), which at that time was managing Apple Records in the United States. The Beatles had no involvement whatsoever with any aspect of the albums. Indeed, they came out in the United States about two weeks before their UK release. Also, the two albums were compiled, at least in part, as a response to a heavily promoted bootleg, The Beatles Alpha Omega, a 4-record, 4-tape set that came out in 1972 and was even advertised on television in the U.S.; the boot's availabiliy made the point that there was no true """"greatest hits"""" collection of the Beatles available in America at that time.  

 Choice of the colour red 

I have removed the claim that the Beatles chose the colour red for this album to show support for Liverpool F.C. Aside from the fact the other album is blue so we might as well suggest that indicates that they must be Evertonians, it's unsourced and extremely unlikely to be true. There has been a request for a source and none has been provided. In fact, there is no source for the claim that the Beatles helped select the tracks or helped with the album design at all (I seem to remember reading that McCartney did but not the others, though they may have done I suppose). Forgive me if I am wrong, but the suggestion that the Beatles picked red to show support for LFC sounds as though it's been made up by a Liverpool fan who either assumes this is the case or would like others to think it is. Some Liverpool fans like to proclaim that the Beatles were keen Liverpool supporters when in fact there is no evidence for this and almost certainly no truth to in it whatsover, and it's interesting that the contributer in question did not go over to 1967-1970 to make any similar reference to the choice of the colour blue indicating the Beatles' affection for Everton FC. Fact is, only one of the Beatles were even remotely interested in football (McCartney) and strictly speaking, he is an Evertonian (although he maintains he supports both clubs). Ringo, according to the Guardian, is an Arsenal fan. Neither George or John had any interest in football whatsoever and it is unknown which if any team they favoured, even there families don't know, although Harrison did seem to imply once that he supported Tranmere Rovers rather than Everton or Liverpool (Lennon added a Liverpool player, Albert Stubbins, to the Sgt. Pepper cover but later said he only did so because he knew he was his father's favourite player and that he himself actually knew nothing about Stubbs). There is a remote possibility that if the group were involved in the album's design that they may have chose red and blue in reference to the two Merseyside football clubs, but if it is so there should be a source for this and it should be made clear that this was not a show of support for one club over the other, which gives a false impression (whether intended or not).  

 I agree.  | I will respond.  

 Unauthorized Beatles compilations before """"1962-1966"""" 

Hi, anonymous user here. I found out about a 4-LP set called """"Alpha Omega"""" that was a Beatles compilation sold through infomercials back in 1972 that supposedly got EMI to compile the hits onto """"1962-1966"""" and """"1967-1970"""". But some people claim that the """"Alpha Omega"""" set was withdrawn from the markets since it wasn't legitimate.

Page protection
Keilana, can you please explain why you have semi protected the page Huma Abedin ? You have stated vandalism which is clearly not the case! Please see Biographies of living persons/Noticeboard where the matter is being dealt with ! Can you explain your actions ? I understand I am new here but it was one of the first pieces of information i have cont. to wikipedia there has been no decision made, I can not understand your actions ! 

Having now had the rules for vandalism explained to me I believe you have abused your power as my contib. clearly dosent fit any of the terms ? I ask you to reaccess your actions.   
  
The decision was made at Wikipedia:Requests_for_page_protection#Huma_Abedin_.28edit.7Ctalk.7Chistory.7Clinks.7Cwatch.7Clogs.29.  Its common practice during an edit dispute such as this for an uninvolved admin such as Keilana to semi-protect the page to reduce the intensity of the dispute.  In any case, from the tone of Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons/Noticeboard#Gossip_magazines_as_reliable_sources it seems that semi-protection was the right call to stablize the article while discussion continued there and on the talk page of the reliability of sources.  '''''' talk 

I would question how uninolved you actally are give these messges left on my talk page:
And don't worry! You'll be able to edit that page in 5 days! Enjoy! —BoL 

And by waiting for five days is by just waiting and you'll be able to edit the semi-d pages. Don't worry, give Keilana some time! She's offline right now, and so am I. —BoL

I will also ask you to explain you relastionship to those who have sort to remove the information ? I would also like to know why you have changed you id ? thanks I will be adding this information to the talk page and any were else i find help !

I think there's a 5th force: long-term editors who believe that they need to/can/can only counter particular editing behavior by altering the policy.  This is exacerbated by their apparent utter unwillingness to see that the effects of the policy they insist upon go far beyond correcting the unwanted behavior.  (They also are or become blind to the fact that the objections raised are due to this unwarranted and disruptive side-effect.)  Actually, the policy probably almost is ineffectual against any behavior: the policy is invoked when the long-term editors challenge the edits.  That the policy says anything about source (or material) types is scarcely noticed by those doing such edits.  We can be virtually certain that any policy wording can and will be used/misused by those with an agenda.  Policy needs to be crafted very carefully.

He was, by most accounts, not the best father figure, but that doesn't diminish the effect he had on Cher's childhood, and more importantly his role as her connection to Armenia. To this day, Cher speaks Armenian because of him, and her philanthropy to Armenia wouldn't exist if he was not her father. Information on Sarkisian is hard to come by on the web, and the Wikipedia page in question was one of the few resources available. If you could restore the page, I'd really appreciate it.

Thanks so much,
Rafi Guroian

 K U C 

The Bible in Matthew says to put your light on the top of the basket, not under it.  The foundation of notability is identifiability, which I think the congregation at KUC, insisting that they are not a building, is successfully obfuscating by having no pictures of the building on their website.  To quantify this statement, it took me eight full man hours to find KUC on a Google satellite map.  It was easy enough to locate the intersection, but looking at [the picture] on Google, there is no reason to suspect that the building in the distance is the church.  Zeroing in on the actual location was finally accomplished by finding a picture of the church on the web site of the architects of the church, and comparing this street view with the aerial view available from Google.  (Of course, by the liberal definition, I still haven't found the church on Google, because the church is not a building.  If this is your personal view, then you need to consider that this congregation is not currently WP:N notable.)  So assuming that the congregation feels righteous and will not help in identifying their we-are-not-a-building building, I'd suggest that the first thing you could do to improve the notability of KUC is to work on its identifiability: (1) get the maps specifically including Google improved, i.e., get the Google place marker on the building instead of in the middle of the street intersection, (2) does the church have a street address, (3) make your own web site with pictures of the building identifying the building as owned by KUC.  Include pictures of the view toward the surrounding area, such as showing where people park on Sunday morning, the Kippax Fair, and the """"adjacent park"""" where the Christmas Day 2005 services were held. Is the maximum seating capacity of the sanctuary recorded by the fire department?  If there is a sign posted to that effect, the sign could be photographed.

Assuming you have access to local libraries and local newspaper archives that go back to 1969 that would include articles about the previous names for the church, you should be able to find additional articles that are not available on the internet so as to satisfy WP:GNG.  You could report these references on your new web site.

I'm still puzzled by the argument that recognition by both the ACT and the federal government are primary references.  I'd be interested in your viewpoint about this.

I'd also think about material that was on the previous article that was of no interest to readers in Kentucky, such as names of the staff, including the complete list of names of ministers.  Learning that Kippax has a kitchen, has preschool classes on Thursday, and the building was used for a concert, is pretty much indiscriminate information = not encyclopedic.

I think the AfD problem here is that people are questioning churches on the definition of notability in WP:N, """"worthy of notice"""" without being able to articulate or quantify their objection.  Note the argument in Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Birchcliff Bluffs United Church that the church there was WP:RUNOFTHEMILL.  The argument is bogus, because the closest example in the essay is a bank that has been in the news five times in 30 years because of being robbed, whereas the church in question could be expected to have mentions, or more, in 500 articles in the last 90 years.  But I think the attitude is real.    """,0.0

It depends upon the type of explosion. It would be great to get articles for every notable R&B;/soul act, many of which are sorely lacking, and to get the ones on the notable ones up to a higher standard of coverage. But I would AfD, merge, and redirect overcoverage on any and all R&B;/soul artists or categories just like I'm doing now for pop articles. Case in point: """"Do You Know Where You're Going To"""" can easily be mentioned at Mahogany, without the need to create sepertate articles. Even though it was a number one hit, there's not enough information avaiable to write a full-fledged article on the song, and a stub repeats information already mentioned in the article for the movie. There is, and has to be, a cut-off as far as what gets included here, and what doesn't: something like a full Stevie Wonder discography, with an article for every single he's ever recorded, is far beyond the scope of the encyclopedia. As I've said before, most singles aren't notable outside of the fact that they are singles. Why make three articles on three singles that made no impact on society, culture, or otherwise; when they could be just as easily mentioned in an article for the song?

If someone writes an article for every Supremes single, most of them are going to get merged or AfD'd. THe same goes for any and every other act. Not even all of Michael Jackson's singles are notable enough for albums of their own.

First, sorry because my poor english.

Hi, i don't want to start a undo-war or something like that, but the avionews post is only a rumour. It's a propaganda speech from a Milan SEA not a declaration of any SIA officer.

I've talked with the SIA spanish comercial manager and he says me that the italian SIA officers inmediatly deny that issue, nor the SIA-BCN cancellation, nor the FCO-MXP flights traspassing... and all is a simply propaganda from Milan in this moments of crisis. This was also confirmed by SIA London regional headquarters...

Unfortunately, I haven't found any italy/UK SIA press relase dennying the Milan SEA president affirmations but i think that informations that I have are enough to question the avionews article.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)

Premiere Films Incorrectly Listed
There are several films listed as being premiered during the inaugural festival, but were fact not even filmed until years later.

"""

With all due respect, the criticism section as it stands is a total mess. Setting aside the fact that it reads as if the year is 2001, an inordinate amount of text is devoted to a recitation of the Bovard article, which is A) a clear partisan attack piece (it begins with a snide and largely irrelevant attack on then-president Clinton's character), B) a shoddy piece of opinion journalism overwrought with loaded assumptions (witness the dismissive tone about """"politically correct noncompetitive recreation""""), and C) dated. Did nobody else notice this thing is almost a decade old? Yet it is being used as the backbone for the longest subsection on an organization that is evolving, growing, and changing to this very day. Bovard *does* bring facts to the table but as it stands now they are sitting in a void of time and space. His article does not make it clear how statistically representative the examples of """"corruption"""" were to Americorps as it functioned circa 1993-1999, let alone Americorps as it functions today.

I am not an expert by any means on Wikipedia's guidelines, I have never added or edited an article and it would not be appropriate for me to start here. But given this article's immediate onslaught of criticism, I would have expected an ongoing narrative about whether any stuck (especially with the imminent arrival of a conservative presidency) and how (and why) Americorps changed throughout the Bush years, leading into its present growth. Instead what we are left with is the cluttered product of a single user's anti-government tirade. I am not against noting that libertarians have a death wish for Americorps, but take, for instance, the section about Bovard's """"unofficial source,"""" who dismisses the reading program. From the beginning it was a rather questionable inclusion, but it is flatly contradicted by the study cited thereafter. Again, I'm no Wikipedia expert, but it seems to me an empirical measurement of reality should trump the anonymously-sourced attack from a pundit with a clear agenda. Why, then, is this whole exchange even necessary?

Equally embarrassing is the sentence about GED students, who now apparently need to be stigmatized for no reason. The short """"Articles suggest..."""" paragraph is only a little less disastrous; it presupposes that helping people get welfare is a bad thing, a judgment call which I think ought to be left to the reader. And even setting all that aside, why, from a journalistic point of view, does the above paragraph re-introduce the Bovard article? It disrupts the readability of this page, making it all the clearer that the criticism section comes from someone who is more concerned with piling one slanted attack after another than with writing an informative, cogent article. Narrative context is jettisoned in yet another paragraph (""""There have been a number of criticisms..."""") which goes on to raise vague, weaselly arguments sourced by an article that returns a 404. The user above me has a raised a critique that I think is also fair about the last paragraph's apparent opposition to the concept of self-esteem.

If I could make a suggestion (and given my lack of Wiki experience I freely welcome its rejection) this whole section, as well as the one above it, needs to be wiped clean. There is nothing wrong with noting that Americorps had some issues in the '90s, so long as this article leaves one able to discern that we are no longer living in the '90s. As it stands, the specific citations strike me as largely irrelevant cases of excess scrutinizing. The $20k+ cost to the taxpayer per volunteer is a valuable piece of information and should not be omitted from this article. It should also not be mentioned without reference to the benefits that Americorps volunteers provide. Contrary to the what the criticism section implies, it does not seem likely that tens of thousands of volunteers per year are being paid only to paint murals and put on puppet shows. If this means that Wiki editors have to conduct more contemporary research (the last 3-4 years seeming most appropriate) in order to determine just what services Americorps volunteers provide and who they affect, so be it. No doubt it would be even more difficult to assess how Americorps changes the lives and attitudes of its volunteers (and perhaps I am biased supposing from the onset that it creates more generous public services) but this, too, would be a benefit. Cite the cost, describe the benefits as neutrally as possible, and let the reader determine for himself whether the end result is """"efficient."""" And move on. 173.52.83.2  M32""",0.0

 Not to worry...jdorney will not be with Wikipedia much longer. 

I have proved time and again that the corrections I make are 100% accurate and verifiable. I have gone out of my way to provide detailed information on sources and where those sources can be located. In contrast the sources quoted by Jdorney are not only dubious, but are not at all supported by the majority of authors and historians. Jdorney uses two main sources...CAIN and Lost Lives. CAIN is a """"estimation"""" at best, and the US State Dept. Jane's Intelligence, British  Human Rights Watch, the Council On Foreign Relations, and various books and articles...all take issue with CAIN's facts and figures. As for Lost Lives, I have the latest edition of that book, and Jdorney completey fabricates the figures. If one reads carefully from 1969-2005, they see the number given as 86, shown as the amount of UDA and UVF members killed by IRA and INLA units. 85% of that number are given credit soley to the IRA. I wonder if jdorney even has the book, since he misquotes it so often. Similar numbers I have provided as to the number and units of British and Irish killed by the IRA is similarly backed up by Lost Lives...if one actually takes the time to read it throughly. I am not going to respond to any more whiney, and childish messages by jdorney. I have informed Wikipedia staff about his biased and unprofessional behavior, and have recieved back that Wikipedia will look into it. It is sad that Wikipedia has to be hampered by a few biased, purposely innacurate Editors, who ignore facts and make up their own...just to support their own one sided views.

PS. Jdorney can leave more messages for me if he wants, but I will not respond to them, and all will be forwarded to Wikipedia staff for review.

I will also continue to monitor the IRA article and this article, to ensure that the correct facts are not continually changed, by a editor, who I doubt will be with Wikipedia much longer:)""",0.0

Orton = Does whatever the fuck he wants because he is a main star and friends with Triple H. Should have been fired already for smoking pot in front of everyone. If it wasn't for Triple H, he would be jobbing in TNA right now. Fuck him, that son of a bitch does not deserve the spot he has. He is good of the mic but ring skills lack, headlock after headlock.

 You're a liar! You have been lying all along including today, and right here above! Gurubrahma, please see the following examples of lies from just today, and here I'll quote what I wrote to him earlier: 

 Kindly please stop lying if you wish me to stop pointing out your lies. It's very rude and disrespectful when I spend my time citing verifiable and reliable sources and you just lie outright, nevermind content, but even on just simply what's happening here, and here's an example of just how you just now did it before requesting that I stop calling you """"liars""""; from Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8, I quote your statement and my reply to it:

 QUOTED: """"I hope that now since all editors have reached a consensus on the article, and have tried to explain you in clearest possible words the difference between numeral symbols and numeral system, you would play a more constructive role. Thanks.   

 QUOTED: Why are you lying again here? yes, lying! As you had been doing for quite some time now and as I have pointed out. The dictionary defines a lie as """"1. A false statement deliberately presented as being true; a falsehood. 2. Something meant to deceive or give a wrong impression."""" First of all, """"all editors have reached a consensus on the article"""" is a demonstrable false statement that you should know is not true and that we're having this exchange here is evidence enough that it isn't, nevermind others. Second, here's your other BIG lie, you say others """"have tried to explain you in clearest possible words the difference between numeral symbols and numeral system"""", Oh really? why don't you tell everyone here that it is I who made the clearest distinction and as far as I remember and see on the page I was the first to make it between numeral symbols and numeral system, and you should know because you have been around. I clearly distinguished in my first post between the Arabic Numerals (1, 2, 3, 4...) and the Hindu-Arabic Numeral system in a paraphragh that begins with """"- For a start,"""" Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#RFC_2 and you should especially know, not just because youhave been around, but also because what you quoted above happens to be just the paragraph under it!  And again I made the distinction in """"the clearest possible words"""" when I proposed here, as my first(!) point in an suggested outline,  Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#Suggested_outline.2C_please_consider_and_discuss """"differentiate a specific numeral script (eg, Arabic Western, Arabic Eastern, Devanagari) from the numeral system (ie, Indian-Arabic, which includes many numerals scripts), the rest of the article should maintain this, it should also keep in mind what the readers may have searched for when looking up this article and cater for those needs (eg, is the reader looking up the Arabic Western numerals script or the Indian-Arabic Numeral system?)"""", and then again zocky, who prefers my version and is against yours, made the same disctinction Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#What_this_page_is_about. The dictionary defines a liar as """"One that tells lies"""" and """"a person who has lied or who lies repeatedly"""", if you want me to stop calling pointing out your lies stop lying! csssclll ()""""

The word 'titbit' carries no offence whatesoever in the UK and 'Titbits' was the name of a general interest UK magazine for many years.

'Tits' is only a very mild and slightly comical expletive in UK use. The word 'piss' is more vulgar but can be found in the Bible. It might be heard in the matey environment of a pub, such as """"Joe has gone for a piss"""". It has more vehemence in """"piss off"""" but with less weight than the good old Anglo-Saxon """"fuck off"""".

 WIKIPEDIA IS COMMUNISM!!!! 

It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.

Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.

As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.

The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.

It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.

The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.

No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.

I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as she slept. The feel of her pajama-covered breasts against me was a welcome sensation, as it h",0.14285714285714285

"Honestly the way wiki is treating this is a JOKE

a. I could have cited NEWS SITES but since when is a news site worthy of an academic cite?

b. if the person that wanted PEER REVIEW felt like it, he would have sought it 20 years ago, HE CHOSE NOT TO DO IT, but none the less his work is known and was mentioned in many math related 'forums' and most ignored it. 

c. Only the recent 2012 open source test of the work PROVED the 30Mod algorithm is a major thing in math, again, GITHUB is a programmers resource and it was not until a computer used the actual 30Mod algorithm that it was shown to be a 'big thing' and since then some news sites have covered it, but I chose not to cite them due to IMO they are not NPOV. But none the less they covered the story.

d. The FACT is a major computer site where programmers have free reign to challenge any claims exists and for over two years not one programmer challenged the findings.

e. so what if the person that discovered it works outside of academia and has no regard for normal 'peer review' the fact is he has no peers if you ask some in academia that know of his work, and I am one of those people that know of the work and how brilliant the work is.

Now to summarize, we have a bunch of pags about primes on wiki, and even pages created after his discovery that USE his discovery (ie. the sieve of Atkin 60Mod work is his work discussed in the public forum and usenet math and physics forums is where he chose to discuss his amazing work.

So now you have 2004 sieve of Atkin using a 60Mod algorithm, guess what that was in his 1995 paper. So does wiki acknowledge that? No. And i didn't even bother to waste my time of the 60 mod algorithm since the big deal as you are saying is the PyPrimes test and I cited that very well, it's a program created in Python, I cited the wiki python page, then I cited Github for both PyPrimes and the PyPrimes testing.

Now while MATH is m forte, I am sufficient enough in computer skills to understand what Github is and to understand how to read the speed tests and the prime spirals smoked every algorithm there is. Now anyone can download python (which I have done) and download pyprimes (which I have done) and run the tests. Guess what just like a math experiment, it is duplicated.

So GITHUB and the tests which are not 'new' should be enough to begin a wiki page on this truly amazing discovery in math.

I myself became aware of the first paper in 1995, as did others in aademia. Recently I became aware of 'news sites' running stories citing what I copied, the links to the Github tests.

While some here can say well it's not AMA, so what, in the world of primality testing primes spirals as per the PyPrimes results shows PRIME SPIRALS are a big deal.

Now I tried to be NPOV in giving all sides of the story, Adoni has a valid 1995 claim I can verify it and I chose not to. But I cited a Drexel Math forum and I could have cited many other math sites discussing his 30mod, 60mod and 90mod prime work in the 1990's. Is this signficant? You bet it is since 60Mod prime sieve aka Atkin sieve is 20004 so his 60mod prime work is well before it.

Now the Github tests mentions 'croft spirals', that's due to in 2010 a person named croft registering a web site and ripping off the 1995 work. MY OPINION.

Now Croft can say all he wants that he found it playng his guitar or whatever he is claiming.

The fact is anyone can document Adoni with Prime theory from the 1990's saying 30mod, 60mod and 90mod is the key.

9 Years later sieve of atkin appears, well that's only a rehash of the adoni 60mod work from the 1990's. Yet no one is giving him credit.

2010 croft puts out his 30Mod work and its inserted into PyPrimes on Github and it smokes every major prime algorithm there is and all of them have pages on wiki as I cited.

So 2012 a work on Github verifies how important to primality the 30mod spirals are, but he says croft spirals, well guess what HelixQ is now out there and taking 100% credit for the 1995 work of Dr. Adoni.

My site to a Drexel math site from the 1990's mentioning 30Mod prime work (prime spirals) is a major cite, since Adoni could care less about the AMA or whatever, in all probability he will soon be nominated for a Nobel on his work, that is how important it is. 

Think about it, not one prime algorithm could beat the ancient sieve of Eratosthenes, none of them. On a computer creating primes all other algorithms are terribly slow. The only two fast generators from scratch are the ancient sieve of Eratosthenes and the PRIME SPIRALS, and the winner was Prime Spirals. Now I can cite recent news articles about it, laughing at academics it links to that said it was no big deal in the 1990's who now all look foolish due",0.14285714285714285

Call Sign Meaning
I've been adding WISconsiN as a call sign meaning for quite some time now only to have it deleted by another user who INSISTS that the only possible meaning for the calls is the defunct WISconsin News newspaper.  As far as I know, there is no official documentation or credible source that states that the calls are a reference to the newpaper and the newspaper ALONE.  So who's to say the calls weren't also chosen because it was an abbreviation of the state's name?  There's plenty of examples of a station using calls with multiple meanings (such as WBBM-TV out of Chicago).  But my main sticking point is that WISN has referenced the calls while advertising itself as """"WISconsiN TV"""" (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JFirQUXfc8)  My theory is that the station chose to keep the calls after the newspaper folded because they referenced the state's name as well (the station had only been using the calls for a few years when the paper folded, so the """"name recognition"""" argument is moot).  But regardless of why they kept the calls, I think the fact that the station made a conscious decision to use them to brand itself as """"Wisconsin TV"""" deserves mention.  """,0.0

My point is not to say that the Anschluss cannot be viewed as the military annexation of Austria but that to view it as """"simply"""" that would be to """"misunderstand"""" its essence, which would not in any case provide anything like absolution but does have the effect of changing the subject (hence my wording """"tends to conceal""""). In any case, to make such a claim without remarking on its limited analytic value and obvious propaganda value would be to set aside a number of basic facts presented elsewhere in the article, and to simply reiterate an argument without quotation or attribution and in any case without pointing out what immediately contradicts it is POV of a subtle sort.

Moneybomb (money bomb, money-bomb, fundraising bomb, Fawkes bomb) is a neologism used to describe a grassroots effort to support a candidate for election by dramatically increasing and concentrating the candidate's fundraising activity during a specific hour or day. The effort combines traditional and Internet-based fundraising appeals with the additional benefits of community organization and potential significant free mass media coverage reporting the candidate's notable success, if any.
The term was used as early as 2004, but came to prominence in Fall 2007 in reference to the 2008 Ron Paul presidential campaign in the United States, with its record-breaking fundraiser of November 5. The term has also been applied to other 2008 presidential candidates.

Origin
According to The Politico, the term was coined in 2007. The chosen fundraiser date for the Paul campaign in 2007 was November 5th, Guy Fawkes Day. This commemorated a time in 1605 when the English revolutionary Guy Fawkes was captured in an attempt to destroy the British Parliament building with 36 barrels of gunpowder. The Guy Fawkes event had also been popularized by a 2006 film, V for Vendetta, which depicted a modern-day fascist Parliament, overpowered by popular revolution that was led by """"V"""", a Fawkes-like character.

The 2007 moneybomb was the largest documented one-day online fundraiser in political history, bringing in over $4 million. On November 6, Ron Paul's campaign stated that in addition, the free media coverage after the event was worth well over $10 million.

The imagery of Guy Fawkes and its redefinition in the film V for Vendetta has been challenged, since Parliament in 1605 was a constitutional system, but in the 2006 film it had become the symbol of misguided government, so the picture of rejecting such a government was ambiguous. Paul's campaign spokesman Jesse Benton clarified to the New York Times that Paul does not support blowing up government buildings: """"He wants to demolish things like the Department of Education . . . but we can do that very pea",0.0

Second, there is absolutely no information in the article about what STREAMS actually does or how it is different from sockets. There is a fair amount of """"My schwantz is bigger than your schwantz"""" here on the talk page but precious little info.

Ten minutes' search elsewhere gave me the real difference between STREAMS and sockets, several articles showing tests that STREAMS was two or three times faster than sockets, and a couple descriptions of why sockets would be a better choice for other tasks.

Thanks for pointing me to the new discussions.

Verifiability is a core content policy and I don't suppose it changes much. With regard to whether the discovery at the PL-LT Comm article is a notable instance of plagiarism from WP by academics: since the cited website is a collection of papers written by students, and clearly published as such (, authors and tutors on page 10) - even tho the website was sponsored by an academic institution - I don't see it as notable occurence along those lines.

True Trips. But User:Zara1709 is appearently from germany, a country with significant nationalism and holocaust history. These guys usually blame all others to be nationalists.

So i will shrink the """"opinion"""" of Zara to the 3 real points, which were made:
The significant rising of hinduism in 4th century AD. instead of 2nd c. BC
content about buddhism-related stuff were deleted
Asoka's """"character change"""" from converted buddhist to buddhist patronizer

1.) The gupta's were the once, who made hinduism established in northern india. This was done by patronizing the Sanskrit language. Previous religions got lesser attention since then. Gupta's were the Hindu patronizers. So this is the time of the rise of """"modern Hinduism"""" in India, which took place til the use of Sanskrit language was minimized in the later middle ages due to persian and other ethnicity's rulers.
2.) This article should present the History of Hinduism, NOT the """"history of buddhism"""", or the """"history of buddhism in India"""". Therefore very special related buddhism stuff were removed. I didn't look at the muslim part in the article so far, but it should be done either way.
3.) Of course Asoka was once converted to buddhism. But since then he had sent his buddhist monks to all parts of his empire. He wrote his beliefs into the edicts of ashoka, which reflect his buddhist identity. He patronized buddhism. Since he was buddhist by heart, there was nothing to mention about him regarding hinduism apart of the contemporary compiled Sanskrit literature of oral tradition. I know, many indians would like to see him as hindu patronizer, but he wasn't at all. These were only the Guptas and Pallavas in ancient days.

Large parts of these points can be seen here:

Constantine founded a new city named after himself: Constantinople. Christian writers played up the idea that this was to be a 'new Rome', a fitting Christian capital for a newly Christian empire.

But they had to find ways to explain the embarrassing fact that in this new, supposedly Christian city, Constantine had erected pagan temples and statues.

"SimCopter Shenanigans
Hiya. I originally followed this controversy in PC Gamer (my god, back when printed magazines were worth a shit), so off the top of m yhead I didn't have any sites. 

I remember there being a few Geocities webpages on SimCopter, but by the time I had graphical internet (circa 1998) it was already considered an old school game.

One page I found while googling that mentions the controversy is http://www.langston.com/Fun_People/1996/1996CFM.html  another is http://lists.samurai.com/pipermail/bryans-list/1996-December/001811.html  apparently the programmer who inserted this easter egg was fired. Go figure - and here we have people trying to push the view that the Clinton years were all about tolerance. What a load.

A corn theorist, for instance, is a Neo-Ricardian, who claims that besides labor also corn is a basic commodity.

You, like 'Dodo', are wrong.  Notice that 'Dodo' hasn't bothered to EXPLAIN, in  detail, his actions.  This is quite revealing!  He must know that I am a 'new' user:  Only on for about two weeks.  Logic suggests that he should, carefully, EXPLAIN why he did something like deleting my posts, repeatedly, without even as much as asking the community.  After all, why should he be RUDE, as he has been, when he cannot claim that I 'should know' not merely what the rules say, but also the way they are followed.  Well, the simple answer may be that he does this kind of thing a lot:  He may ORIGINALLY have been respectful, but maybe he's developed a practice of 'drive-by-edits'.  He seems to have that reputation!  But as tempting as it may be to assert that, I think his actions are far more detailed and specific, and malicious:  His pattern of deletion of my posts is to delete ALL ALL ALL of my posts, not merely some fraction that (he would argue) violates some rule. So, the 'rule' (actually, the practice) he seems to be showing is this:  """"Do not allow James Dalton Bell to post ANYTHING, on any article, and certainly not on 'jim bell'.""""  Will 'Dodo' deny this? So far, he's avoided commenting!  'Dodo' seems to do this by simply finding SOME reason to dislike my post (even just a small part of it, though he doesn't say), and then use this to 'justify' deleting everything.  The best explanation, I  think, is that somebody has put him up to it, and he wasn't careful enough to cover his tracks.  And, a few other non-thinkers back him up.

Relevance of True Believers Syndrome
Andries, what is the relevance of adding a section about """"True Believers Syndrome""""? It appears you are pushing your POV by adding this section. Explain why you insist on adding this section and how it does not violate a NPOV.  talk-email 
It is relevant for the article: SSB is mentioned in the article True believer syndrome.  
You are pushing your Anti-Sai bias by including an empty reference to """"True Believers Syndrome"""". If you attempt to include it, I am going to remove it. I guess it is only coincidence that you happened to create the page for """"True Believers Syndrome""""? Ref  talk-email 
Well, the inclusion of this article in the see also section seems to be yet another subject for mediation, otherwise we'll keep reverting each other until one of us dies.  
Andries, the  Wikipedia policy WP:NOT states that Wikipedia is not a soapbox.  I suspect that we have differing views regarding what this means.  From my perspective, the aim of many of your edits, such as the one which sparked this subsection, appears to be to convince people of the merits of your favorite views.    I would very much like for you to share your views on the WP:NOT policy and your understanding of what this policy means.   
Please note that I had removed the true believer syndrome as described by Robert Todd Carroll from the main text in the article, because Jossi complained that people mentioned in this article were not notable. I objected to that by saying that everybody mentioned in this article was mentioned either by reputable media sources or scholarly sources that reported about SSB. Later I found out that the only one who was not mentioned by reputable news articles was Robert Todd Carroll who wrote entries in his book and website Skeptic's Dictionary about SSB and the true believer syndrome in which he mentioned SSB. So I decided to move the true believer syndrome from the main text to the see also section. I think it should stay there because it is clearly relevant for the article. With regards to violating the Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not policy I think that only one sentence could be relevant in this dispute and that is """"[Wikipedia is not] Propaganda or advocacy of any kind. Of course, an article can report objectively about such things, as long as an attempt is made to approach a neutral point of view. """" I think I would be breaking """"What Wikipedia is Not"""" policy if I linked the word charlatan in the see also section, unless of course, SSB is mentioned in that article.  Of course, it will be clear that I do not agree with the critical information being minimized, but I do not think that I am breaking the policy here: SSB is very controversial and this article should reflect that.  
Andries, thanks for pointing this out. It is apparent I need to edit the """"True Believer's Syndrome"""" article because its mention to SSB is not referenced by reputable sources. You attempt to make your case against SSB by citing the non-reputable and original research of Tony O'Clery and Paul Holbach. Either you reference these citations by reputable sources or I'm deleting it. I am going to remove the references to O'Clery and Holbach (whose link does not work anyway). Trying to cite the """"True Believer's Syndrome"""" article because it refers to SSB is deceptive because you were the one who made that reference to SSB on that page.  talk-email 
Hi Andries, thank-you for your response.  I am glad you agree that if you created a see-also link to charlatan that this would not reflect Wikipedia policies.  However, I do not understand your reasoning that seems to differentiate between a link to charlatan and a link to True Believer's Syndrome.  From my perspective, it seems that a see-also link to charlatan would be innuendo that SSB is a charlatan, while a  see-also link to TBS seems to be innuendo that devotees of SSB suffer from TBS.  In both cases, it seems to me that NPOV is violated because controversial opinions are not presented as such.  Rather, the implication of a see-also link to TBS is that Wikipedia is voicing the opinion that devotees of SSB suffer from TBS.NEWLIN",0.0

 Hi Edward. You have a few options. First is to start on the article talk page, which I see you've already done. I know a few days has already gone by, but maybe ping your posting again and see what happens. 
 Your next step would be to bring this to WP:RPP and request semi-protection, but make sure you have your evidence at hand. Gather a few diffs (both your edits and the IP edits), and show that you've attempted resolution on the talk page. Look at other requests for PP and see what the standard type of format is, and successful or denied reasons; that'll give you a good idea how to submit your request. If the reviewing admin agrees, the page won't be editable by IP editors. Semi-page protection usually is usually a finite period of time, but after protection lapses, you can re-request it if need be. Just mention previous page protections on any subsequent requests.
 I'd also look at WP:ANI, where you can post for admin intervention. If semi-PP is denied, I'd go here, but there may not be much that they can do. Since it's a school IP address range, admins are generally hesitant to block those types of IPs. Yngvarr """,0.0

Have you looked at the SSP report for Fredrick day? Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Fredrick day. He's got his own variable IP access, plus he has some wireless networks in his neighborhood. That's his IP, 99.99%. (Notice that there are two edits, different IP in the same block.) And the text is pure Fd. Look, you see IP from a certain range editing parlipro articles, you draw a certain conclusion, and you are pretty likely to be correct. The level of necessary coincidence for this to not be Fd would be astronomical. The particular interest in Sarsaparilla's edits, the mention of me, plus the first two IP fields, this is Fd. The vast majority of Fd IPs have not seen any edits before he started using them, they could probably be safely blocked ... but I'm not terribly exercised about it. I'd revert them if I thought them damaging. I hadn't looked at the other edits. I will. Anyway, thanks. And my apologies for any possible insult in what I wrote, but this whole affair has been about very selective attention. I'm seeing it happen with other editors. Once there is a pall over an editor, especially an active one, every move is scrutinized by anyone who ever had a conflict with him; one editor now, 25,000 edit level, is clearly being harassed, yet it looks like ArbComm will sanction him, not those who are harassing him. (For what? For complaining, it looks like.) We'll see.

In Sarsaparilla's case, Fd was there with one vicious personal attack after another, on AN/I, and where was the attention being put? On Sarsaparilla, for having put up an article on the Easter Bunny hotline. We don't normally indef block users for putting up a non-notable article! """"Last straw,"""" is what is said, of course.

(2) I have prsented sourced evidence from individual G8 websites, created by respective governments, that the EU is a member.  Nowhere is there any official statement that the EU is not a member. Some people are arguing that when it says the EU joined the G8, the word join has some special meaning (and they must therefore accept that Canada is not a member becasue I have shown the sentence where it says that both Canada and the EU 'joined').

Of course it is. This sentence in many sources follows on from the sentence that says that countries are represented by their Head of State/Government and is needed simply because the EU does not have a Head of State/Government. It doesn't mean anything else. 
(5) Lucy-marie further quotes """"The EU does not take part in G8 political discussions"""". Of course it doesn't: it would be quite wrong for the President of the Commission to do this since the EU cannot have a single view on these issues, being an association of many countries (some of which are represented in the G8 anyway). 
(6) Nowhere is there a source saying that the EU is not a member.

Why have you changed the image again? The text is now all but unreadable. It is now forced into single-word lines, extending down past the reference section. ,It looks ridiculous. You quoted IMGSIZE, yet again, in the summary. That policy states:
 In general, do not use px without very good reason

What that means is, the policy needs not to be unilaterally enforced at all costs. If, as in this instance, there is a need for a change in size, it is permissible. The policy further states:
Where px is used, the resulting image should be no more than 500 pixels tall and no more than 400 pixels wide, for comfortable display on the smallest devices in common use.

I have already (and repeatedly) demonstrated that upsizing to 250px is all that required. (I bet even 220px would work). That is well within the limits. The change to the picture itself is negligible, and therefore does not impact the article negatively in any way. It only servers to benefit the article by making the text within the caption more wieldy and easier to read. It also eliminates the impact of needlessly extending the picture frame all the way down to the refs.

Surely you can see this. Since you're quoting this policy so much, surely you know that it does not prohibit this edit. I have asked repeatedly that you look at the effect on the article, both before and after the edit, and in doing so,. surely you see the need for this edit.

 Hu12 administrator apparent libel and abuse 
Report to a Chair:

Hello, this is a request to review an apparently libelous and abusive comment made about a living person at the talk page for Mount Hood, done by administrator Hu12.  Toward the bottom at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Mount_Hood#Climbing_Records  

The issue stems from, as you'll see in the article's history section, my interest in adding a simple climbing record listing for Dan Howitt, with the press article references.

Hu12's post:
After going through the """"google results"""" (a disturbing education of sorts), there appears to be a long line of aliases for Dan Howitt, posting over various websites and forums promoting himself and besmirching the characters of fellow climbers and related. Appears this is an attempt to use wikipedia to import offsite conflicts and further an adjenda. It has been removed. I'd suggest that Dan Howitt  read the following, Wikipedia:Wikipedia is in the real world and Law Of Unintended ConsequencesHu12

My reply:
Please remove Hu12's Libel and Vandalism above and please report this user's abuse to Wikipedia administration. Also, Hu12 of the """"google results"""" you searched most are in support of Dan Howitt, with tons of his official summit photos on Rainier, Adams, Hood, Shasta, and listings of his timing officials. You strangely give weight to the abusive chat-site gossip and unsupported libel, and your own post above is of that nature. Chat-sites with this sort of conduct are sad. I'm reporting your libel and abuse to the wiki administration.Saffron1x (talk) 

Note Hu12 cites a link above as support for his allegations of Dan Howitt.  In reading the chat-site thread, and note it's a mere chat-site and has a lot of personal attacks, gossip, unfounded content, libel, etc, you will, nevertheless, find considerable support for Howitt including climbing record photos, timing officials names, etc.  Hu12 emphasizes the allegations about the use of aliases, and this is gossip and unsupported.""",0.0

The article states that the primary financial grievance was between the large distillers, who would have to pay 6 cents in tax, and smaller distillers, who would have to pay 9 cents.  Per what, please?  (Pint, fifth, quart, gallon, barrel.)

Also, to put that in perspective (since today that is a trifling amount), what did the average  cost?  Was this an onerous tax?  If the cost of a given quantity was 10 cents, then yes, since the tax would then effectively nearly double the cost of a small distiller's product.

Proposals:
1) change phrasing in intro
2) do not change focus of the majority of the page on the """"close circle""""
3) perhaps make """"writers"""" section more reader friendly for casual readers with a chart, or something quick and simple to read
4) change naming of """"writers"""" section to something reflected broader scope
5) I would like something like 3 & 4 to be closer to the top, but I do recognize Doom's concern that it weighs down the intro, so we can see for now if it works.

I'm suggesting no change beyond that, but I feel I have provided the beginning of sufficient evidence to support the necessity of this change.

"This edit
This was reverted. When u use web news sites such as Tamilnet to esatblish facts outside of WP:SLR articles u will run into it. That's why I stay away from it as much as possible. You really do have to read WP rules very carefully such as WP:RS & WP:Verifiability. It says {[Quote|Articles should rely on reliable, third-party published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy.[4] Reliable sources are necessary both to substantiate material within articles and to give credit to authors and publishers in order to avoid plagiarism and copyright violations. Sources should directly support the information as it is presented in an article and should be appropriate to the claims made: exceptional claims require high-quality sources.

In general, the most reliable sources are peer-reviewed journals and books published in university presses; university-level textbooks; magazines, journals, and books published by respected publishing houses; and mainstream newspapers. As a rule of thumb, the greater the degree of scrutiny involved in checking facts, analyzing legal issues, and scrutinizing the evidence and arguments of a particular work, the more reliable it is.

Academic and peer-reviewed publications are highly valued and usually the most reliable sources in areas where they are available, such as history, medicine and science. Material from reliable non-academic sources may also be used in these areas, particularly if they are respected mainstream publications. The appropriateness of any source always depends on the context. Where there is disagreement between sources, their views should be clearly attributed in the text.}} That's why we use Tamilnet as a QS not RS. You have thousands of peer reviewed academic books to establish the same facts using google books. No one will fight you then.",0.0

"possible problems  

I want to point out a few possible problems with some specific sections or topics, esp pertaining to 'no citations':

no citation, npov: The system is still encountering strain and financial constraints, some say more than ever. And what is the point of the sentence anyways?
Healthcare
The Campbell government inherited a health care system that was encountering strain and financial constraints upon assuming office.

No citation: It also has an issue that he campaigned on NO cuts to government workers, hospital workers, etc, in fact, when accused by the NDP of his going to have to make large cuts and layoffs, he fired back that the NDP was fear mongering:
[edit] Income tax reductions
In 2001, Campbell campaigned on a promise to significantly reduce income taxes. A day after taking office, Campbell reduced personal income tax for all taxpayers by 25 per cent over two years. Cuts were applied to every tax bracket; the tax rate on the first $30,000 of income was cut by 2 points from 8.4% to 6.05%, while the top tax rate for income over $85,000 was cut by 5 points from 19.7% to 14.7%.

No citation:
Education
While funding was increased to record levels during the Campbell government’s first term in office, challenges remained in K-12 education.

Again, no citation. Campbell might have been in favour, but it was started by the NDP, as many pundints are quick to point out when hospital closures are compared against the cost of new luge track.
2010 Olympics
British Columbia won the right to host the 2010 Winter Olympics on July 2nd, 2003. This was a joint Winter Olympics bid by Vancouver and the ski resort of Whistler. [18].
Campbell, a main proponent of the bid to get the games, attended the final presentations in Prague, Czech Republic and made an impassioned plea for the games to come back to Canada for the first time since it was held in Calgary in 1988.

This is only a quick look. I would appreciate some feedback before changes are made.
As I have pointed out earlier, a great deal of this article reads like a press release. If you compare this premier with any other, there will be a world of difference. 

Perhaps it should be scaled back to the bare minimum bio, and everything else gets chucked into the appropriate spot.

Qwyrxian, you were quite objective in your point1, but may not be so in your point2 except US and UK nautical charts that you mentioned and Oda Mari provided the links in the """"NPOV side"""" above.

The documentary year book with which I found that """"Diaoyu Islands"""" but no """"Senkaku Islands"""" was used by SG of the UN in his official letter is an international almanac, named """"International Organizations and the Law of the Sea: Documentary Yearbook 1996"""" of """"NILOS Documentary Yearbook"""". It is for collection of related documents from the United Nations system. Therefore, this is a very high, if not the highest, quality of year book or almanac. Another UN document a UN General Assembly document can be found in page 85 of this year book, which mentioned """"D"""" and """"S"""" as follows:""""Since the 1970s, China and Japan have continued to dispute sovereignty over a group of five islets and barren rocks, known in Japan as Senkaku and in China as Diaoyu, ..."""". And for encyclopedias, I checked Britannica, neither """"Senkaku Islands"""" nor """"Diaoyu Islands"""" can be found . When you asserted """"all"""" Encyclopedias, """"all"""" almanacs, can you list all of them you checked? Please don't do cherry-picking. Don't assert too much more than what you actually did. Bobthefish2 ever gave a search result on Library of Congress, I re-checked it and am sure it is correct:

(note: Bobthefish2 has been topic banned for a year due to """"Decorum"""" issue, but it does not mean that the objective contents he used before cannot be used by us)
So, your point1 can be used by us to reach certain consensus. Your point2 is biased and it asserted too much more than reality and objectivity.

Hi Pigsonthewing,

As someone who has been silently observing your behaviour over the past few months on Wikipedia, I am worried by what I perceive to be a downward spiral of petty fighting, vindictiveness, childishness and bad faith on your part. It seems that you've lost the joy in editing Wikipedia, and now you do as some sort of way of making yourself feel better at the expense of others. What a small, small man you are. Grow up! Get a life! Find yourself a girl to have sex with or something, because the way you've been sliding downhill is bringing everyone else at this fine institution down. I'm here to create an encyclopedia. You seem to be here to fight with other people and cause disruptions. You're making everyone else's life harder. Please stop that; just go away.

That is truely an amazing version of the story. If you read these discmags the title """"most hated person"""" came from rumors that Kim Schmitz had denunciatet many members of the BBS scene. Since this version is not citeable neither should be in the article. 

His legal team maintained that this was not insider trading as the information did not come from anybody else and Schmitz had created the business opportunity himself. “I think the outcome would be different in a court of law today as the Internet bubble had just burst at the time, everyone had lost a lot of money and there was so much media attention that I became the scapegoat,” Schmitz maintained.

Where does this statement come from? Why is that relevant?

Schmitz later conceded he had been young, stupid, naïve and aggressive. “I had no idea about the legal implications of my actions,” he acknowledged. “I hope my mistakes can therefore serve as an example for young entrepreneurs. They should remember one golden rule be careful and always think twice about what you are doing.”

This is a sentence for an autobiography, not an Wikipedia article.

Schmitz, who has also long been a fan of Formula I and organised several big parties for the races in Monaco, now plans to develop a racetrack and is currently scouting potential sites around the world.

Future plans without any details have nothing to do with Wikipedia. He can announce this on his own home page. 78.34.4.52  """,0.0

The example is a poor one, and should be removed from the article. The article states that it seems to require 5 colors, presumably because the grey area cannot simply be colored red, yellow or blue without re-coloring. However, it *can* be colored green, and that doesn't require shuffling any of the other colors around. This makes it a very misleading counterexample. I know I spent a lot of time scratching my head wondering why this was considered a counter-example at all, and how the caption made any sense.

Card rule
Excuse me. I read the talk page. You said and I quote """"If the style is listed on a card as its own style when the routine is drawn or when the routine is announced, I treat it as its own style. If the label is only used in passing, it goes in the subsections."""" That's why I moved """"Pas de Deux"""" to it's own row because Katee and Will in season four (U.S. version) and  Melissa and Ade in season five (U.S. version) did a pas de duex; it was on the card. Wake up. I was following your guidance. Why would you change it? Why would you react negatively to edits that are consistent with the rule you made up. Speaking of rules, I don't know where you got this sense of entitlement from because you do not WP:OWN the page. I went along with it for the sake of consistency but you clearly don't care about that because you reneged on your own rule when you undid my edit. 

Categorization
Don't patronize me and say that you appreciate the attention I'm giving to the page because if you did you wouldn't have reverted all my edits. The changes I made were not subjective. African dance is not jazz. How the show presents dance versus this page being a primer on dance is a non sequiter. African dance comes from AFRICA, not from jazz dance. How in the world is that subjective? This is obvious. You changing it back to being from jazz dance is actually what's subjective. Funk is STREET. Do some research. Electric Boogie is not a separate sub-style of Electric Boogaloo. It's more like a nickname for Electric Boogaloo, i.e. Michael/Mike, Jennifer/Jenny. So I don't understand why you would list this as a sub-style/variant of Electric Boogaloo. To be completely honest """"Electric Boogie"""" is actually a song. People do the Electric Slide dance to the song """"Electric Boogie"""". Think about the laymen who are reading this page. Because of your suborness, they're going to walk away thinking it's actually a separate dance style when it's not. Nothing that I've said above is subjective. It's based on facts. How can you to call my changes ill-advised and subjective while at the same time claiming the content you added was implemented """"in such way that WP:OR and needless debates on what divides styles does not occur."""" Are you serious? The wikilinks I provided at the beginning of this paragraph has citations in those articles proving that what I'm saying is true.

I'm glad you responded.  I was not looking for an apology.  I realize the second part of the comment wasn't directed at me.  The first part seemed to be putting me in my place  when you could have written a note on my talk page.  Now that you've explained your position, I understand.  If you find any others that I've uploaded, it's not necessary to post anything on my talk page.  I understand what you're saying, although I disagree with one part of it regarding film publicity photos, which were mass-distributed, sometimes without registering for copyright.  We don't know which are free and which are not, so it's not something that can be pursued, and I wouldn't try to claim any specific image falls into that group.     I still see problems with the Blondie image.   For one, it doesn't show anything vital that the article couldn't do without.  They're all living people, one of whom isn't even notable enough for a Wikipedia article, and they're not doing anything.   It only shows what they look like.   If it was a significant moment and if the photo showed them doing something that could not be adequately described in prose,  I could understand.  Regardless of what brought them together, the photo itself gives nothing except to show what they look like.   Given the degree of thought you've given to the actress photos, I don't understand why you accept a fair rationale saying """"they cannot be brought together because they live in three separate areas of the U.S."""" which is a false statement, contradicted by common sense - there are numerous ways they could be brought together - and by the very existence of the photo.  I'd accept a rationale that justified its use, but not that.  Still, you said you may even nominate it for deletion someday, but that it's not a priority, so you're obviously not completely convinced.  Anyway, I understand your viewpoint on the actress photos, so thank you for taking the time to convey your thoughts.  Regards.    """,0.0

"""

My worry is the number of editors who would scrutinise your every movement. On WikiSource you don't have as much history so there are less people watching you. It would be a much more pressured environment for you. Can you remain calm in these circumstances?   
My perspective on Wikipedia is much different now. I have enjoyed immensely Wikisource where, granted, the atmosphere is much friendlier and encouraging, so my editing energies can safely go there. (I have made close to 9,000 edits there with no problems and certainly no attacks or negative feedback from editors.) I don't intend to get involved in the award culture on Wikipedia such  FAC, FAR or other areas where editors are competitively vested in collecting awards.  My first interest is fixing up articles that I would like to link to Wikisource articles, but are in such bad condition that I don't link. Secondly, I would create articles that are needed for explanations for Wikisource articles. I will stay away from any article that belongs to a vested editor, where an editor lists and article under articles """"I wrote"""" or refers to """"my articles"""" in posts. I will make it a practice to check histories for that kind of editor. Outside the FAC/FAR arena there is not much of a problem, I don't think, if any at all.  I have created over 600 articles in a multitude of subjects, mostly to fill in """"missing links"""" on Wikipedia. I will continue with low key endeavors such as that. However, at the sign of any """"push back"""" I will simply not continue editing the article or dealing with that editor, or even editing Wikipedia for a while. Also, my misery was generated by a small group of editors. I am hoping they will be proscribed from harassing me in an Arcom settlement.   — (Talk)

None of the historical sources link them with rajputs. Ghakhars use the title raja but are not rajputs as do the Turks of Hazara, in Manakrai,and they are not rajputs either - read about Raja of Mahmoodabad. Moreover, the real Rajputs of Rajputana use the universal title of Singh to denote their proud identity (the term raja is reserved for the rulers). As for the Gujjar issue it is well documented that Jat, Gujjar and the so-called rajputs of northern Punjab are the same people. This leads to the conclusion that maybe the Janjua claim to be rajput is suspect as I have said all along. Darbar-e-Akbari, Tuzuk-e-Jahangiri and other historical works do not mention Janjuas and Rajputs together and locate the former in Bhir far away from Hazara, and more importantly, from real Rajputs as well. 

I accept there are people who live in Tanawal and use Tanoli as their geographical origin but they do not fit into the clan system of the original Tanawalis. We know who the gujjar families are in Tanawal and they do not use Tanoli for themselves though they do say they reside in Tnawal. Other Gujjars in Hazara are either settled or are move about between Swat, Upper hazara and Azad Kashmir.

Additionally, you seem to be on a mission to prove something that is not proveable. I know you are in the UK and I can meet you face to face to discuss this if you prefer. We can sort a number of things relevant to this debate as well as you can know who I really am.

"Deleting Pop This Whole Place Open 

Excuse me, but what the fuck do you think you're doing? I posted a page on here for my band 'Pop This Whole Place Open' and you promptly deleted it. What is the meaning of this debauchery? Wikipedia is clearly a website used to provide information. What harm comes from posting a page about my band. It was completely truthful and I am just trying to make a name for myself. Who do you thin you are deleting this page? You go around judging people's contributions to other pages about popular subjects and that is perfectly fine, but who the fuck are you to tell me that the information that I posted about my own band isn't worthy of being on Wikipedia? Huh? Who would better be the authority on the subject than I. I ought to find you and expose my penis to you. You, asshole, are nothing but a whore. A whore who thinks they have some kind of say in the matters of life. What if we became famous? Then there would be a page on here about us and you wouldn't be deleting it. But since we are some band you've never heard of that makes it okay to delete our page. You must be some high authority in the music business that I don't know about. I must have insulted your intelligence by making a page which only I could possibly contain all the knowledge to. Regardless of the reason that you deleted my page, let me tell you something, Schmegma Von Dicksuckington, you can fuck yourself, long and hard, with a baseball bat covered in barbed wire. How dare you delet my page.

'Nuff said. Or perhaps not. Here's a tidbit from that last WS """"Trivia"""" section linked above:

 According to Tug McGraw, one of the police horses, who lined up in the field during the 9th inning of Game 6, was not """"stadium trained."""" (8th item down the list)

I don't think you can top (or is it bottom?) that for trivia. There's a simple reason that over a quarter of a century of trivia sections (and probably more) have piled up in these World Series articles: Writing well is hard work. It's just too easy to simply drop minutiae onto these pages and file them under """"Trivia"""" and let somebody else do the hard work of integrating them . . . later. 

Part of my motivation for dredging up all those links above is that I've noticed an inconsistency of style and layout, and some confusing or redundant info in all the WS articles going back to 1903. It's like the same car built by different contractors at different times with different materials. I find it a bit troubling because it's a sign of limited effort, limited means for anybody to have developed a plan for what could be a real highlight of WP (can you say """"Fall Classic Portal""""?). I found it fairly easy to take the '06 trivia about La Russa and Leyland and create a separate section under the """"Background"""" section, and it seems to have held up since Friday night. But it took some time to sift through it and move the info.

Cutting to the chase: All this WS """"Trivia"""" is classifiable. The better it's organized, the less it will seem like trivia, so if a handful of """"labels"""" could be cooked up for categories of info formerly known as trivia, the overall style of these articles will seem to read better. That ought to settle the trivia issue.

Postscript: For instance, a 4-1 WS where one contender splits """"on the road"""" and then comes home and sweeps to win 3 more and clinch is fairly rare from what I've looked up so far. What the Cards have done against Detroit in 2006 matches what NY (NL) accomplished in 1969 (except the Mets dropped Game 1 instead of 2 to Baltimore). I'm still working my way thru past Fall Classics to see when else this happened, so I can add this info to the '06 article in an appropriate place, but not as an addition to the dreaded Trivia section. A heading that might be appropriate for this info each and every year: Long series, short series. 4 or 5 games would classified as a short series, 6 or 7 classified as long. Easy to spot trends in this area and develop copy to fill a section like this. Was a short or long series predicted each year; by who; was a trend broken, were the prognosticators wrong, did a noted BB writer point this out so it doesn't smack of the dreaded Original Research? Now really 'nuff said.   (talk)  """,0.0

Bill,

I don't find your un-edits a gender-based attack.  I am largely concerned with the content of the article itself, but I wonder why you put up so much opposition to my very small edit.  Surely it can't mean that much to you.

I don't want to make derogatory comments about men.  I have nothing against men, and I don't enjoy tearing people down.  You mention the term """"well-referenced"""".  I prefer for statements to be well-referenced too.  I don't think that this particular statment is well-referenced, and furthermore, I don't think that it can be well-referenced, because I don't think that it is true.  And so I wonder about the author's neutrality.  Wikipedia articles are supposed to be both neutral and well-edited, and that statement is neither.

I don't want the article to be deleted either.  I think that it serves a useful purpose, and I enjoyed reading it.  I just want to do away with that particular sentence.

Of course, if you can find evidence that American women are materialistic sluts, then we have no problem at all.  But I'm pretty sure that whoever wrote that was confusing personal opinion for universal truth.

While the idea that the UK is the instigator of the war is delightfully odd, the OP does have a point - the article briefly alludes to the existence of earlier bombing (first para, """"Change of strategy"""") but never explicitly mentions it. However, the official history does explicitly connect the August raids to the start of the Blitz, even if they weren't the sole reason:

It would, of course, be too much to see in these raids on Berlin the whole cause of Hitler's next move; but they unquestionably added to his anger at the activities of Bomber Command. it would not be long now before D-day. What better policy, then, for this final phase, than to enjoy a swift and sweet revenge by hurling the Luftwaffe in force against London. For if the British capital could be reduced to chaos, the task of the invading armies would be enormously simplified (...) 'The British', he screeched, 'drop their bombs indiscriminately and without plan on civilian residential quarters and farms and villages. For three months I did not reply because I believed that they would stop, but in this Mr. Churchill saw a sign of our weakness. The British will know that we are now giving our answer night after night. We shall stop the handiwork of these night pilots.' Three days later, on 7th September, the Luftwaffe abandoned its offensive against the sector stations and began the assault on London. From the point of view of winning the battle, Dowding himself could not have made a more satisfactory decision. (pp. 182-183)

Omitting to mention the British bombing through August, and the theories of a """"revenge for Berlin"""" motive, seems a bit strange.   """,0.0

We don't really have a """"too many of X"""" argument for any Main Page content. The only semi-similar thing is the way that TFA nominations are penalised if a similar article has run within a particular period, but that approach doesn't map over onto DYK, which has no points system and a vastly higher throughput of articles daily. DYK's approach is and always has been that if content meets the requirements, it gets accepted. Also, it's not as if a surplus of articles in a particular topic area are holding up other articles appearing in DYK. As I said, it has a fairly high throughput in any case and even a large number of articles on a single topic - I mentioned 300 Indonesia articles in the course of a year - gets lost in the total number of articles that appear in the slot.   20:39""",0.0

 Coming to an understanding 

I've done most of the lion's share of edits on this article, but I want to make it clear that my interest is in having a neutral article, and that I'm not trying to push the idea that the Seth Material is true or valid (that's a judgement that the article can't make).  For example, the first use of the word """"channeled"""" had quotes around it.  I was the one who put those quotes in, though someone else removed them.  I inserted the first instance of the word """"purportedly"""" (even though it is on the list of words to avoid) because I felt it was needed, and I have reinstated it when other editors removed it.  Someone named """"Itsmejudith"""" has just changed the word """"awareness"""" to """"the idea"""", and I support that change.  I'm mentioning these small things simply as examples to show people that the neutrality of the article is important to me.  And despite what you may have thought (speaking to Verbal now), when I substituted """"Jane Roberts, speaking as Seth, said"""" for """"the Seth personality said"""", I believed that I was making a change that was a leap forward in neutrality (since Roberts was the one who actually uttered the words).

Verbal, I would like to try to bury the hatchet and work together on this article.  Your interest in the article appears to me to be negative, but I am willing to consider the possibility that I am wrong and to see your point of view.  In order to work together, we'll have to discuss specifics of the article on this page.  We'll need to discuss individual passages as well as the broader issues of the article's size and the proportion of primary to secondary cites.  If we make a concerted effort to work together, I'm sure we can come to an understanding and improve the article.  Are you with me on this?  """,0.0

 Dear AndyTheGrump, if the PUBLISHED and REFERENCED decision of EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS (ECtHR) on Armenian """"Genocide"""" is not a PUBLISHED RELIABLE source, then what is a reliable source??212.174.38.3  

 European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) Decision On The 1915 Armenian Event 
This must be added to the article:
On 17 December 2013, (the case: Perinçek v. Switzerland (application no. 27510/08)) European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr. Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide. Perinçek said """"Armenian genocide is an international lie"""". ECHR punished Switzerland for violating Perinçek's right of freedom of expression (Article 10). ECHR referenced three decisions on its verdict: 
a. In November 2007, The Spanish Constitutional Court had found unconstitutional the offence of negation and had taken the view that
the mere negation of a crime of genocide did not constitute direct incitement to violence. 
b. In February 2012, the French Constitutional Council had declared unconstitutional a law which made it a criminal offence to deny the existence of the genocides recognised by the law, finding it to be incompatible with freedom of expression and freedom of research. 
c. The United Nations Human Rights Committee had expressed its conviction that “[l]aws that penalize[d] the expression of opinions about historical facts [were] incompatible with the obligations that the Covenant [on Civil and Political Rights] impose[d] on States parties ...” and that the “Covenant [did] not permit general prohibition of expressions of an erroneous opinion or an incorrect interpretation of past events”.ECHR ECHR punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr. Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide (Perinçek said """"Armenian genocide is an international lie"""").

I hope now that the researchers can freely and without any fear research what happened in 1915.
Notice that in 2013 ALL Ottoman Empire archieves are open to the researchers and any researcher can freely read ALL the archieves and documents in Turkey.
However, Armenia still does not allow its archieves to be searched and reserached. 212.174.38.3

Of course atheism is a religion: it attempts to answer all the big questions that other religions do, and is based on a metaphysical claim incapable of empirical proof.  But you can quibble about what """"religion"""" means all you want, because the fact remains that theistic religions and atheism are all worldviews.

Many evolutionists disagree that evolution has nothing to do with atheism.  E.g. Dawkins said that Darwmin made it possible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist, and Provine claimed that a religion was compatible with evolution only if it was for all practical purposes indistinguishable from atheism. 

Communism is predicated upon atheism. 09:52, 30 Mar""",0.0

 TruSilver, Mediation, et al 

You can include the following statement as part of the mediation template if you wish: I'm not able to edit at the moment because jdchamp's admin shopping on WP:AIV finally paid off

While, obviously, I'm happy to accept any attempt to produce a better US Mobile Phone Companies template, I have concerns about the mediation proposal currently made on the subject.

My first concern is that mediation is supposed to be one of the tools used after discussion has failed on the relevant article's discussion page. At this stage, the only person who appears steadfastly unable to posit views other than attacks on editors and the fact he disagrees with them (a discussion requires that you express your reasons why, and address the reasons given by the people who have opposing views) is jdchamp. A better position at this point would be to ask jdchamp to participate fully in the discussion on the Talk: page of the appropriate article. I have contributed my views to that discussion page multiple times in the last two weeks, and given my reasons for my beliefs. I have done also said that I believe this is the most appropriate action at this stage to jdchamp, and to TruSilver, the admin jdchamp has involved in the dispute about what is going on there. Unfortunately, he has instead repeatedly posted the same comments over and over again to my talk: page, varying from false accusations of bad conduct from me, to expressing a willingness to discuss the article (yet, for some reason, not followed by actual action on his part.)

Mediation only makes sense if the parties involved continue to have a dispute that's based upon a genuine difference of opinion after proper discussion. While that different of opinion might exist at this point, unless jdchamp actually expresses his differing opinion fully (as in, gives valid reasons and challenges the reasons his opponents give with legitimate arguments), there has been no discussion, and therefore going on to the next stage of dispute resolution seems premature.

My second concern, and believe me I'm not happy in saying this, is that I have concerns about TruSilver as the mediator. Please do not take anything I say about this as assuming bad faith, I'm absolutely sure TruSilver thinks what he's done is right: but that said, I don't trust his judgment on this issue, based upon an on-going harassment campaign leveled against me by jdchamp. TruSilver has consistently misrepresented my actions while doing little to challenge jdchamp's on-going campaign. In particular:

 TruSilver has accused me of using his talk: page to continue my apparent argument with jdchamp. This is untrue: I have only ever posted once to TruSilver's talk: page, posting an apology for the fact he'd been involved in the mess and expressing my concern about it. After it became obvious that jdchamp was posting at the same time, and challenging my comments about my personal state of mind, I made the decision to not post there again.

 TruSilver has accused me of refusing to discuss jdchamp's differences with me, these differences concerning the Mobile Phone Companies template. This is also manifestly untrue. I have have been a full participant in the discussion on that page's Talk: page, even participating in a poll that I believe was posted prematurely, arguing why I believe what I do and suggesting compromise solutions that might suit all parties. I have removed jdchamp's vandalism of my page, which in some cases involved posting claims that he was """"willing to discuss"""" various issues, but were neither posted in the correct place, nor actual discussions of those issues.

 TruSilver has also leveled unnecessary personal attacks on me, accusing me of being dysfunctional, and of disruptiveness, edit warring, and incivility. With the possible exception of my (pretty justified) expression of frustration last night, nothing I've done of late fits the latter category, and the nearest thing I've done that comes to """"edit warring"""" consists of removing spam that has been repeatedly added to my page by jdchamp. The other comments are just plain insulting and wrong.

I've suffered a sustained campaign of harassment against me for most of the last 15 days. I asked for help, and instead the admin who put his hand up has essentially acted as an enabler for the person harassing me. Other than an ultimately unenforced threat to block jdchamp if he continued to spam WP:AIV with inappropriate demands I be blocked, nothing has been done to encourage jdchamp to tone down his behavior, and as he showed last night with three warnings, and multiple reverts on my Talk: page, his behavior remains as bad as ever.

While I'm sure TruSilver has acted in what he believes is the most appropriate way given the facts immediately available to him, I don't believe he h",0.0

"Jessica's e-mail is blocked so she can't email anyone. And her user page is completely protected. I wonder why. Hey! We have similar user name. What a coincidence. There are users on that list that aren't even active like Isis. She was the first administrator to be banned. She doesn't even use sockpuppets. Clearly, her legal threats were attention-seeking behavior. Jessica isn't. Apparently Wikipedians like to keep track of her and not Isis. So it would make sense to add her to the list. That way everyone can keep track of her and nobody can say that they don't know. Administrators can block accounts on sight. So if anyone acts like her, they will all be blocked. Including her on the list is vital because some people don't know her specific behaviors and if they have that similar behavior, they will be blocked on sight. Jessica never asked for attention. The Wikipedians gave it to her. So maybe you should ask them why they gave attention to her. Apparently Wikipedia is also mad at her to create an article for her on ED. Apparently Wikipedia hates ED enough that I can't even post the link of her page. Just type in her name in the search and you will see it.",0.0

"I disagree.  Nobody has yet made a case against the inclusion of statistical data when it’s used in support of a discussion about causal theories, which in this case it would be.

I recommend that people take a look at how this issue is handled by other, similar Wikipedia articles, particularly Race and intelligence, which has been at least as hotly contested as this one.  Although the focus of that article is on the various explanations that have been proposed for this IQ difference, the IQ difference itself is considered central enough to the article that it’s represented visually in this chart.  This image used to be part of the article also—it was eventually removed because editors decided that it was original research, but nobody there had a problem with the idea of this data being depicted with an image.

The original research claim obviously doesn’t apply to an image from the DOJ website, and I think all of the same principles that apply to race and intelligence apply here also.  The only question that needs to be considered is whether the data represented in the image is relevant to the article, which in this case it clearly is.",0.0

 are the inheritors of so-called pro-capitalist anarchism. The only anarchism movement to outlive the early anarchists is the one present in Europe AND America which RJII and his cohorts would call 'collectivist' Use of this term is seriously POV and un-encyclopedic - """,0.0

More ridiculous wikilawyering (as in """"misinterpreting policy or relying on technicalities to justify inappropriate actions""""), precisely what you accuse others of doing, with """"internal inconsistency"""" being the latest straw you're clutching to. You can not """"posit"""" the sources aren't solid enough by offering the fact they also use Prso's nickname in addition to his real name as a supposed proof of their lack of solidity. Ludicrous. The fact that Prso mostly goes by his nickname, Dado, does not make his real first name, Miladin, non-existent. And his real name being Miladin IS backed up by numerous reliable sources. The fact that sources mentioning Prso's real name Miladin also use his nickname Dado is a """"inconsistent"""" only in your world. No one disputes he mostly goes by Dado.

You've been removing verified info from Dado Prso over the span of 8 years already (whilst with a straight face characterizing the work of other editors' as """"harping""""), standing guard against, and I quote, """"Serb nationalist talking points"""", a """"thinly veiled political advocacy"""", and an """"unverified Serbian name claim"""". 

Not to mention accusing people of WP:Point. Precious. I guess including information backed up by reliable sources qualifies as """"proving a point"""" in your little world.

There are hundreds, if not thousands, examples of Wiki BLPs titled according to the person's nickname, and all of them have the the person's real first name included in the lede:
Co Adriaanse (Jacobus """"Co"""" Adriaanse)
Sol Campbell (Sulzeer Jeremiah """"Sol"""" Campbell)
Alex Ferguson (Alexander Chapman """"Alex"""" Ferguson)
Matt Busby (Alexander Matthew """"Matt"""" Busby)
Jupp Heynckes (Josef """"Jupp"""" Heynckes)
Ruud van Nistelrooy (Rutgerus Johannes Martinus """"Ruud"""" van Nistelrooy)
Marco van Basten (Marcel """"Marco"""" van Basten)
Uli Hoeneß (Ulrich """"Uli"""" Hoeneß)
Toe Blake (Joseph Hector """"Toe"""" Blake)
Cotton Fitzsimmons (Lowell """"Cotton"""" Fitzsimmons), and so on, and so forth (just to keep it to the sportspeople)

Somehow I don't see any sign of you over the last 8 years on any of those bios, removing the individuals' first names from their articles' respective ledes nor are you spewing any of your wikilawyering nonsense on those article's talk pages, complaining that the real name sources are """"internally inconsistent"""" (btw, most of the bios don't even provide sources for the first name information) or pointing out that the person's nickname is more widely used than his first name as basis to remove the first name from the lede. 

Also, whatever happened to that earlier claim of yours about including Dado Prso's real name in his bio constituting """"thinly veiled political advocacy"""", and an """"unverified Serbian name claim""""? Considering there are numerous non-Serb sources stating Dado Prso's real name to be Miladin, do you still see it as a Serb nationalist effort? 

So to recap. There are reliable sources meeting WP:BLP criteria under WP:SOURCE and WP:NEWSORG as 'factual content' (including a well-established news agency with numerous reprints) that explicitly state his real name is Miladin. No amount of wikilawyering from your end can change this basic fact.  """,0.0

 Ncmvocalist's questions 

Hello Rootology. You've made a series of comments at the block review (for the block imposed on Ikip), and you later reversed Ikip's block. I would request that you answer my questions as promptly as possible. 

 Have you made any attempts to communicate with the blocking admin prior to your unblock? If so, how many minutes elapsed between your attempts to communicate with the blocking admin, and your unblock?
 You have stated to AMIB: """"You as an admin have zero standing or authority to levy this block as one of the deepest """"deletionist"""" partisans on this site, just as anyone deeply involved in the squadron would have zero standing or authority to undo it."""" Can you please provide diffs to support this claim?
 In saying to AMIB: """"You must undo this block and not do such a thing again, or you will not be long for your tools once the Arbitration Committee sees what you're about"""", can you clarify what you meant?
 You've stated to AMIB: """"You pretty much missed the goal as far right as you can on this one, for being involved."""" Can you provide diffs for this claim? 

Thanks.   

Hi. Blocks and admin actions are never sacrosanct, unless they are from the Arbitration Committee as a body or cited as an OFFICE action. Any can be reversed once by any admin in good faith with justification. I provided my justifications here. For your specific questions:
 We were talking in the ANI thread. That is classically regarded as sufficient, but I posted the diffs that he was going to pull for him. There's no canvassing for days before the block. Since blocks are preventative by policy and not punative, the block automatically has no standing. I re-opened the archived discussion, that Abd closed, so that my unblock can be reviewed and re-instated by any uninvolved admin if required.
 This would take a long while to gather it all, but a long-standing user's leanings are hardly secret. I'm a BLP zealot most times; Ikip is an inclusionist; DGG is an inclusionist; JoshuaZ is an inclusionist; AMiB is a deletionist; Phil Sandifer is an inclusionist. 
 Admins have repeatedly been told by the AC (and policy) that they may not use tools in areas in which they are involved. My strongly-worded suggestion was so that another good admin doesn't fall down that hole.
 See #3. Again, any demonstratably uninvolved admin can freely reverse my unblock, I waive all wheel warriness, etc.

AMIB has replied to my unblock, by the way, on that thread.  (C)(T) 

Okay; just to note that it was very appropriate of you to revert the closing and leave the thread open, for the reasons you've stated. 

There are a couple of things I'd like to clarify for future incidents. If AMIB had participated in that particular deletion discussion, then using his tools would likely be inappropriate. Alternatively (as may be the case here), if AMIB had been involved in personal and direct conflict with Ikip, especially if it was recent, then his use of tools would not be appropriate. Such involvement can cloud judgement. However, mere general participation in other deletion debates/discussions is not necessarily enough for an admin to be considered """"involved"""".

 Question about citation (Me is new) 

In the section """"Posthumous view of Brown's character"""", it says, """"Unfortunately it is also this less studied, highly interpretive view of Brown that has prevailed in academic writing as well as journalism[citation needed]. """"  I am wondering if James W. Lowen,Italic textLies My Teacher Told MeItalic text, (New York, NY: Touchstone, 1995) could be used for this citation.  It is primarily critiquing American high school textbooks, not secondary sources, but is highly critical of their treatment of Brown.  Lowen cites 18 textbooks in his 2007 edition, and comes to the conclusion that none give a fair description of Brown.

Um, To simplify the above, do textbooks (tertiary sources) count as """"academic writing as well as journalism""""?

 Orlando """"Jonathan Blanchard"""" Bloom 

I anyone tries to add this back, here's the story. Back in 2005 or so, my roomate (Jonathan Blanchard, or as we call him Jo) had pretty long hair and his then girlfriend called him Jorlando Bloom, as a general funny/derogatory insult. It pissed him off and we started to call him that for a while. Apparently one of us got on Wikipedia and vandalised the page . About two days ago, he found out, and thought I recently vandalized the page, but we checked the history and it turned out to date from March 2005. That's nearly 4 years ago! Then  added a reference for this , probably in good faith, but for the various biographical details (date of birth, etc...). 

So now you have a ton of mirrors and sources that based themselves on this Wikipedia article, saying that Orlando Bloom's full name is Orlando Jonathan Blanchard Bloom. Hell, even the disambiguation page was affected , again probably in good faith (and then reverted a few days ago, by my roomate ).

Ms Gundagai, normally I would be thrilled to be the centre of so much attention (so far all your edits, except those to your userpage, have been devoted to me), but article talk pages are for discussing the article, not for making personal attacks on other users. If you wish to give me feedback, I would be most interested to read it. The appropriate place for such postings is my userpage, not article or project space.
If you truly object to editors """"fiddling...and inteferring with some else's words,"""" then you might want to consider whether Wikipedia is the right place for you. Every time you make an edit, you acknowledge acceptance that your edits may be edited any number of times by any number of people. At the bottom of each edit page is this statement: """"If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed by others, do not submit it.""""
I strongly caution you about continuing to make personal attacks on other users. The community condemns personal attacks, and should you choose to continue making them, it will result in further and longer range blocks. It's very easy to avoid such blocks by simply commenting on article content instead of editors. I'm sure we can all work together constructively and productively if we refrain from making comments about other users.

Humans have evolved from primates. There are the alpha males, the regular males and the females. Gay males have female minds. At one point in human embryonic development all people were once female. That is why males have nipples. Females have the ability to achieve a muscular orgasm just like a male, however most women do not know how.

 How they do it. Revealing how vandals prevent accurate information on Poppers, that they disagree with, from being posted here! 

I just figured out what's going on  what these guys are doing to those of us who want to edit the poppers page by adding more accurate and meaningful information, but which they do not agree with. If you can find the time, I urge you to go into the """"history"""" of the poppers section or page (click on the """"history"""" tab at the top of the page), and then go to the bottom of that page. There you can click on the largest number, and essentially see ALL the history of this page  from the day it was created!

I just spent time looking at it, and a clear pattern emerges. To be kind, there are some pranksters among us. More realistically, and at worse, they are vandals. Some of them appear to be working in concert with each other to make arbritary changes to the edits of people they don't agree with. They literally  and very quickly  'revert' the versions back and forth among their own versions, all the while essentially vandalizing the credible information that more knowledgeable people have posted. Then, when the unsuspecting editors realize something's going on, that their edits are being deleted almost within minutes of their having posted them, and when they try to figure out how best to react and deal with the problem, as they begin the inevitable complaining and asking of questions, they are harrassed and threaten with having their accounts 'blocked'; or they're falsely accused of violating various rules of Wikipedia, upon which they are often then threatened with even more sanctions against them.

It is precisely this kind of unethical, irresponsible and despicable behavior that was exposed in the world wide media earlier this week. Had I not seen the news reports which described exactly this kind of activity being rampant on Wikipedia, I would most likely have never figured out what was going on.

You assume a lot. I don't """"support Storms,"""" it's not personal. Storms is reliable source of a kind that requires caution: he is clearly affiliated with cold fusion research. However, who should write a book on the topic? Someone who has no experience with it? Storms isn't simply editorializing, expressing his opinions, he shows the basis for those opinions with meticulously referenced text. As with any review of the field, he cites research according to his opinion of what is relevant, and this, then, gives us a guide to what is notable in the field. There are thousands of peer-reviewed papers on cold fusion, and even more  much more  if we allow conference papers. He can use conference papers, we can't, but if he cites them, that makes them sufficiently notable for our reference. Because of the position of the field as to """"general opinion""""  very unclearly defined  we have to present everything in the field as controversial, including what is quite well-established, such as excess heat. If you don't think excess heat is reasonably well-established, you should read the 2004 DoE review again, and I could cite reliable sources that the work is sound. The claim that it's all junk research, quite simply, can't be supported from any solid source, only from what are, really, tertiary sources as Hipocrite is now using at the article, in place of the much stronger Storms reference, which is a secondary source. It's like the media reports that Fleischmann's work was never replicated.

In fact, the core claim, that excess heat was found when setting up highly-loaded palladium deuteride, has been confirmed over and over. The original radiation claims were bogus. The research finding neutrons at moderate levels was bogus, artifact and error. The claim that the origin is nuclear, and in particular that it is """"fusion,"""" is unproven. In other words, OCMV, I'm quite with the 2004 DOE review, except that the field has shifted since then, the evidence for nuclear effect is stronger, a clear and consistent pattern has emerged from a review of all the research, such that negative replications typically, now, can be seen as confirmations of a general hypothesis forming, but no clear proof that the basic process is fusion.

For example, the SPAWAR group shows energetic neutrons. The work is solid and published. Aspects of it have been confirmed, and I am, indeed, assuming that there will be more confirmation; their work, over almost twenty years, has been quite solid and conservative, they've done proper controls, etc. The levels, however, are very low, and this kind of phenomenon has always been used as an argument against cold fusion: there are all these apparently contradictory experiments. I was just reading yesterday one protest that """"all these experiments produce different amounts of heat, how come there is no consistency?"""" """"So what if you find neutrons, this is inconsistent with the reported heat.""""

Actually, it isn't. What that shows is that neutrons aren't involved in whatever is generating the heat, but that the energy source, what I call the black box, is capable of creating conditions where a little hot fusion takes place. For example, take the Be-8 hypothesis. That will generate energetic alphas at 23.8 MeV. These can cause some hot fusion to take place at a low level, indeed, it would be expected. The alphas are found, confirmed, Miles et al's work showed, way back, that helium generation is correlated with excess heat. No excess heat, no helium. Excess heat, helium, in an amount proportional to the excess heat, and the ration is at 25 +/- 5 MeV, as reported by Storms and others. Krivit thinks this is a bogus figure, but I'm not convinced that Krivit understands the problem. If you don't capture all the helium, you will get a higher figure, and that is, indeed, what is found, but with some experiments, great care has been exercised to detect all the helium, and that gets us tightly toward the expected figure from d-d helium fusion, 23.8 MeV.

One writer put this way: Fleischmann didn't just discover some isolated island, that could be specified by simple coordinates, he found an entire continent, and those who try to find the island find different things, their reports vary all over the map, literally. We do not know to what extent low-energy nuclear reactions are possible. Storms details a list of observations that it would be desirable for a CF theory to explain. This does not mean that he thinks all these findings are artifact-free.

Elemental transformation under conditions that produce the excess heat phenomena is now quite well confirmed, overall. The field suffers from a lack of highly specific confirmation; this results from the conditions under which the work has been done.

Your Uncivil Friends Refuted

Or were you saying something to the over 300 people who've downloaded this refutation of you're lies?:

http://www.mininova.org/tor/1264745

And so that everyone can see part of it here:

JoshuaZ said:

""""Starfire, as I tried to explain to you Wikipedia cares about reliable sources and verifiability, not truth. Now, if you read that guideline, you may understand why in general AIG and many of the other sources you used are not reliable sources.""""

Hey JoshuaZ the liar, where does Wikipedia's policy say that AnswersInGensis.org is not a reliable source? Where JoshuaZ the vandal and liar? Show us. So you think saying, """"Now"""" is scientific evidence that you are a wise and intelligent teller of the truth or that you know what a reliable and verifiable source is?

JoshuaZ, where does Wikipedia's policy say that the Jacob Sheep Association = a reliable and verifiable source that Jacob Sheep are biologically primitive you hypocrite? Explain that hypocrite who personally attacked Starfire777 using lies.

Show your references JoshuaZ. Saying, """"Now"""" is not a reference that your accusations are true are they? Why can't you make sense Joshua?

Again, where did those verses prophecy anything? Do these look like prophecies JoshuaZ?:

Joshua also said:

""""In this case, they did have sources, so you have even less of an argument.""""

Wrong JoshuaZ. Simply citing sources as you yourself said does not make the source valid. It must be substantiated and verifiable. Why do you conveniently forget that you smug babbling hypocrite?

Your later comments don't merit much of a response, but I wThen he said:

""""ill simply note that accusing people of bigotry, bias, hypocrisy, irrationality and trolling makes my earlier comment about not using """"Darwinist"""" as a slur somewhat irrelevant;""""

Because you said so JoshuaZ, and whatever you said is true is true because you said so. So much for references eh? All you have to do is accuse and it makes you right, right hypocrite? See how you go round and round in circles using circular reasoning?

""""if your earlier comment toed the line, the one above crosses it.""""

Because you said so JoshuaZ, and whatever you say is true because you said so. Science!

""""I suggest you calm down""""

I suggest you not use sarcastic insults like that, ok hypocrite? You're implying that the Starfire777 is ill-tempered merely because he points out that you are hypocrite and uses logic to do so (as well as verifiable references on Answersingenesis.com which you lied about not being reliable and being against Wikipedia's rules to cite), ok liar?

I suggest you also not command a Christian to follow your moral standards over Christ's, over God's. He is a Christian don't ya know? Are you now God to tell him how to feel and think? I suggest you read this verse and take it to heart which millions of Christians know very well so that you learn how not to offend them again:

""""Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger, and give no opportunity to the devil."""" - Ephesians 4:26-27

Last time I checked JoshuaZ, neither your nor Wikipedia's rules superceded God's. 

""""and read the relevant Wikipedia policies and guidelines while you wait for your block to expire.""""

Oh the old """"you need to read it but I don't"""" and """"you sit and think while your grounded young man"""" insults. What an arrogant, childish hypocrite you are.

I suggest that you stop pretending that whatever you say is true merely because you said it, and again, learn what Starfire777 properly told you to learn.

I'll enhance the list for you:

Reference, evidence, truth, reality, lie, bigot, hypocrite, fallacy, circular reasoning, troll, stalking, harassment, insults, hatred, and love.

And Joshua also said:

""""This is in addition to issues of original research in regard to Biblical prophecies and other issues on the Charles Darwin page.""""

Wow you sure like to weasel-word: """"other issues""""? What are you references for this vague """"other issues"""" JoshuaZ the Policy Master of Wikpedia?

And Joshua, who said anything about prophecies? Where did Starfire777 say anothing about prophecies? No JoshuaZ the wannabe scholar, he said """"predicted"""" in the same way that science can be used to predict the outcome of an experiment. If your lazy-brained truth-careless self had been paying attention to what he said CARE FULL Y you might have noticed that the verses were using PAST TENSE JOSHUA, not FUTURE TENSE JOSHUA.

"International Symposium on Dr Axel Munthe

The second  international symposium on Dr Axel Munthe’s  life and work   will be held  on Saturday 13th of September at Hildasholm, Leksand, Sweden. 

From the Royal College of Physicians in London, Professor Ian McDonald (adjunct Prof Dept. Neurology, Yale University also Prof. Emeritus of Clinical Neurology, University College London will be speaking on the relationship between Dr Axel Munthe and the famous Professor Charcot of the Salpetriere in Paris.

The eminent architect, writers and former curator of Villa San Michele, Levente Erdeos will be giving a talk on “The makings of Villa San Michele, some connections to contemporary art and thinking”

Other distinguished speakers include the Swedish author, Bengt Jangfeldt,Dr Peter Cottino from Capri, Mårten Lindståhl, Sweden, Dr.Katriona Munthe-Lindgren from London, and Prof.Alden Smith, Department of Classics, Baylor University Texas, USA.

When Munthe received his medical degree in Paris in 1880 at the age of 23, he was the youngest Doctor of Medicine in Europe. His thesis was on the subject of gynaecology and obstetrics. Munthe had, however, been deeply impressed by the influential Professor Charcot in the field of neurology, and therefore already at an early stage was greatly interested in general diseases.

In the same year he opened his first practice in Paris, which was frequented mostly by members of the large Scandinavian colony of artists. He lived intermittently in Italy where he helped the cholera-stricken population (1880 on the island of Ischia, 1883 in Naples).

In 1887 Axel Munthe left Paris and settled in Anacapri where he worked as general practitioner. In 1890 he opened a practice in Rome where he was consulted by foreign dignitaries resident in Rome, as well as by Italian patients. He was appointed physician to the royal Swedish household to care for Crown Princess Victoria, later queen, from 1892 until her death in 1930.

During the First World War Axel Munthe served as a physician in the British Red Cross at the front in France. He described his activities in the book, Red Cross & Iron Cross, which was published in London in 1916.

Axel Munthe became a legendary physician who always gave free medical treatment to the poor. For some time he maintained a hospice for elderly, destitute people in a castle outside Rome. He was an outstanding psychologist who was extremely restrictive in prescribing treatment by drugs. The preferred forms of treatment prescribed by Munthe included hypnosis and therapy through music.

The Story of San Michele entirely overshadows all other publications by Axel Munthe, although it includes much of what he had already written earlier. His very first publications covered a number of travel discourses which appeared in the Stockholm newspaper, Stockholms Dagblad, and which described his experiences of relief work during the cholera epidemic in Naples. These discourses came out in book form in Sweden in 1885, in England in 1887, and later in 1910 in Italy. Subsequently he wrote a number of other papers and short stories which were later collected and published: for example, Små Skizzer, published in Stockholm in 1888; Vagaries, London 1898; Memories and Vagaries, London 1908; Bref och Skizzer, Stockholm 1909; En gammal bok om manniskor och djur, Stockholm 1931; Vagabondaggio, Milan 1933; Ein altes Buch von Menschen und Tieren, Leipzig 1934, etc.

Hildasholm, the house that Axel Munthe built for his bride in 1910-1911, was designed by the architect Torben Grut (who would later create the Stockholm stadium). It lies amongst the trees on the edge of Lake Siljan in the heart of Dalarna.

 Surrounded by gardens and pine woods it looks over the peaceful
waters and comprises Swedish, English and Italian furniture and paintings
from the 17th, 18th and 19th century Europe. It is still used by the family
while also being opened as a museum for the public during the summer
months. 

The gardens were created by Axel’s wife Hilda on the promontories
and in the ravines surrounding the house where suddenly the well ordered
English garden breaks into the wild and romantic natural environment.

 This is the last time I am going to tell you: Stop vandalising and stop disturbing me 

Family names are a valid article. Each family name in every language can be an article. Instead of your Serbophobic (and therefore racist, since you are apparently Korean, at least that is what you claim) vandalism edits, go and do something useful like making wiki articles for Korean family names. Most certainly do not ever again take the liberty to tell me what to do, because you have neither right nor authority to do that and your snotty and inappropriate comments are unwelcome.

Eventually, as I have already replied at the ludicrous discussion you started  where, BTW, no one took your side  I will create longer pages for each individual family name when I have time. They will be full articles in their own right. For now, leave the Serbian family names alone and do not input vandalism redirects to specific people. People are people and they have their own article and names are names and they have their own articles AS NAMES, not as incidental necessity for redirection. 

Further your comparison with the family name """"Hitler"""" is absolutely abhorrent, as all people who had that family name have changed it after WW II, so that family name does indeed relate to only a signe person. And even so, it would still be possible to write an article about the family name as such, but it's not my interest, so I won't do it. However, writing such an article would be legitimate and such an article could exist as a wikipedia article.

On the links that you have been posting on my page (and which I am going to delete, because they are unnecessary on may talk page) it says VERY CLEARLY: """"MAY"""" and NOT """"MUST"""". Are you really incapable of comprehending the difference between the two? If you are, stop editing Wikipedia altogether because all your edits are likely to be violation of rules.

And, I repeat: do not come to scribble nonsense on my wall again. I have nothing to tell you that I haven't told you three times already and I do not want your inconsequential silly musings on my wall. Go away!!

Wikipedia sued for ‘aiding neo-Nazis’
December 7, 2007 - 11:14AM

A left-wing German politician has filed charges against online encyclopaedia Wikipedia for promoting the use of banned Nazi symbols in Germany.

Katina Schubert, a deputy leader of the Left party, said she had filed the charge with Berlin police on the grounds that Wikipedia’s German language site contained too much Nazi symbolism, particularly an article on the Hitler Youth movement.

“The extent and frequency of the symbols on it goes beyond what is needed for documentation and political education, in my view,” she told Reuters. “This isn’t about restricting freedom of opinion, it’s about examining what the limits are.”

Schubert said she had taken legal advice before making her move, and that she hoped it would encourage public debate on how far internet platforms should be allowed to aid proponents of extremist, anti-semitic and racist ideologies.

“There are signs neo-Nazis are trying to take advantage of such structures, and this needs to be stopped in good time,” Schubert said. “Especially given that Wikipedia is too important to jeopardise as an open and self-regulating project.”

A spokesman for Wikimedia Deutschland, an organisation that promotes the internet lexicon in Germany, rejected the charge.

“We don’t really know what Ms Schubert’s problem is,” Arne Klempert, managing director of Wikimedia Deutschland, told Reuters. “What’s important is the context the symbols are used in, and here it’s quite clearly education and documentation.”

“Anyone who tries to prevent the Nazi period being documented properly has a strange understanding of the world, in my view,” Klempert said. “Because that’s the best weapon there is (to prevent) something like that from happening again.”

Public display of Nazi symbols is illegal in Germany, but they can be used for educational and artistic purposes.

Schubert also came under fire from party colleagues.

“Katina Schubert fails to grasp the self-regulating mechanisms that work in Wikipedia,” Heiko Hilker, a Left party media expert in Saxony’s state parliament, said in a statement.

“Right-wing extremism on the World Wide Web cannot be tackled via national criminal proceedings,” he added.

Schubert said police would pass on the charge to state prosecutors, who would decide whether to open an investigation.

Klempert said Wikipedia’s structure, which enables internet users to discuss and edit content, ensured no bias arose. “Particularly on subjects like the Hitler Youth, you can be sure it would be changed in seconds if it did (show bias),” he said.

The Hitler Youth was the Nazis’ official youth organisation.

I had this prepared to send but JHJ got in first: mos:dab is there for a purpose. Your version http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Energy_%28disambiguation%29&oldid;=215040252 runs counter to the manual of style in several ways. First, wp is not a dictionary which means the lead line cannot read like this Energy (from Greek ἐνέργεια """"operation, activity"""") may refer to. Second, the primary article is the root article (the article named as the dab page but without """"disambiguation"""") ... so Energy is the primary article. Of course there may be legitimate disagreement with this but it can only be addressed by changing the name of that article to Energy (qualifier) not by refusing to follow guidelines on this dab page.

"I have to disagree that it has any place outside of a speculative mention within this article.  This is mostly because all of the science surrounding powered descents without heatshields due involve the concept of a tethered descent.  All of the science regarding this topic is contained within the topic of the space elevator.  This includes the material concerns, robotics, energy transfer to power the climbers, etc.  Even more notable is that all the talk on this topic mostly concerns ascension, ie placing satellites into orbit.  Very little is concerned about or researched on the topic of descension with a space elevator.  Mind I call it a space elevator because this is the recognized term used to describe it within technical circuits, including NASA and other research institutions.  I agree that the idea is a possibility within 200 years for a powered descent without heat shielding,  but as of now, there is simply no research, talk or even speculation on any project to even look into it.  Thus, a mention at best within the article.

With due respect this dog's breakfast of an article deserves a POV rampage and a much more exhaustive one than the minor changes made on December 11. Please look over some of the undocumented, irrelevant, and in some cases just plain weird interpretations of Revelation that were removed or edited and suggest which edits should be undone. The article as a whole is unnecessarily repetitive and only a small fraction of it represents the views of modern scholarship (see my comments above under Talk section 11: Everyone's view).

On Thomas Jefferson: Myth America I sympathise with your concern to '[provide] a useful contrast to the other interpretations in the article' which generally reflect conservative christian in-fighting about the meaning of the book but tell us very little about Revelation itself. I'm not convinced, however, that to dismiss the work as the incoherent ravings of an early christian """"heretic"""" (Cerinthus) is the best way to do this. A number of scholars have demonstrated that the book follows a clearly marked concentric structure which evidences balanced literary construction, while it has long been acknowledged that Revelation parodies and inverts the imagery of first century roman imperialism and the emperor cult in particular to make it's point (see eg Steven J Friesen's recent work in this area: Imperial Cults and the Apocalypse of John). This hardly supports Jefferson's view that the work is a meaningless rant but nor does it support the highly subjective perspectives of historicism and futurism which have obviously irritated you. A balanced, well documented historical-critical introduction to the work should, in my opinion, make up the bulk of this article with other conservative christian approaches acknowledged separately in brief, concise fashion. I am quite happy for the Jefferson reference to remain for its whimsical value and tentatively suggest that it could be accompanied by some of the numerous historical warnings by prominent christian leaders and commentators about the danger of misusing the book.

I also note that the reference to Mithraic parallels has been re-inserted in the Authorship section. What this has to do with the question of authorship I have no idea. The parallel itself is completely unconvincing and the book from which it is taken is a typical example of an author falling in love with his subject and unnecessarily exaggerating its importance. While I don't deny that the work, by Payam Nabarz, represents a good layman's guide to Mithraism the suggested parallel between this quote and Revelation 1:4-20 on page 51 (see Google books for the text) hardly warrants the preface that the two are 'almost identical' or the overly enthusiastic observation that 'the [similarity of] spirit is abundant... to the extent that the names of Jesus and Mithras could be interchangeable'. These are not the remarks of a careful exegete. It is quite likely that there are echoes of Mithraism, the religion of the roman army, in Revelation, which freely reuses both Jewish and greco-roman mythology in polemical fashion, but this is not one of them. Would anyone object to a re-removal of this paragraph?
  

""""this... article deserves a POV rampage""""— All I can say to that is read this WP:NPOV.
Why not be inclusionist instead of deleting chunks of information you don't personally agree with? An encylopedia is supposed to present all legitimate views, not stick with just one/the most popular.

"""==Questionable punishment of D*98==
The January 2010 block against User:Darryl98 was extremely harsh, IMHO, as being a 1-month block for a WP:3RR violation that was escalated by a more-experienced user who was well aware of goading people into a revert-war. Perhaps an 8-day block would have been more fair, with an attempt to discuss the situation during those 8 days, and possibly remove the block sooner than 8 days, after true consensus (that means a mutual agreement). Please understand that Wikipedia policies are actually much more fair, in writing, than the way some users (and admin users) misapply those policies: the typical block for WP:3RR is only a 24-hour block, not 1 month. In fact, per WP:Blocking_policy, use of excessive blocking is a violation due to the reasoning that new users will become highly irritated by excessive punishment. The idea of fair punishment isn't just a matter of human decency, or common sense when trying to actually """"collaborate"""" with other users, no, much more than those reasons, fair punishment is a stated policy issue. I think what needs to be added, to avoid excessive punishment, is to develop a type of """"Code of Hammurabi"""" as a list of wiki-punishments for each situation, based on length of tenure, total edit-count, and repeat-offenses, so that the punishment does NOT just become a matter of """"lengthen the block so a user won't come back soon to cause more trouble"""". Meanwhile, rather than reducing future conflicts, excessive punishment poisons the Internet community with unhappy users who spread the word of how they were mistreated. Typically, users will not see unfairness as a few admins crossing the line and violating policies in a harsh manner, instead, a user victim is likely to """"blame Wikipedia"""" for being a """"bad system"""" that harrasses and abuses people. What needs to be emphasized, in discussions during a shorter block, is that some (many?) users (admins) violate policies, but this is not condoned, it's just hard to enforce because a banned user can return using a social-networking site that has thousands of IP addresses and Wikipedia cannot easily stop them. Also, Wikipedia has very limited appeal processes, and so there is nothing, yet, as sophisticated as even the """"American notion of justice"""" in Wikipedia: there are no trials by jury of informed peers (chosen at random). Instead, many issues are decided by """"dog pile"""" groups, who collect around a common bias or mindset, as a sort of """"feeding frenzy"""" or hive mind that sees a negative remark as a veiled attack against the hive, and many members of the hive must sink into """"sting mode"""" to counter-attack a person who states angry remarks. Currently, Wikipedia likes people who are ultra-mild and don't claim any Bill of Rights but simply beg to belong with the others. Hence, people from democratic republics come to Wikipedia and might demand their rights under the law, without realizing it is the Law of the Old West: be as nice as possible to avoid getting shot by other users/admins who are toting wiki-guns. Only some people think users have any rights to fair treatment, despite current WP policies that even require actions to be fair within those regulations. Perhaps WP needs to teach """"fairness classes"""" to users who come from fascist countries or domineering parents: being fair and courteous is not a strong force of nature, but rather must be taught to users. - 
Wikid, I'm sure that you are well aware of why WP cannot tolerate the improper use of WP:Sockpuppets. Just as your socking as Wz777 had to be stopped, so did PilgrimRose's socking as Darryl98. But blocks are not regarded as punishment, they are regarded as protection of WP from those who, like yourself, are having difficulty working within the rules. The indef block of a sockpuppet is applied equally to all such.  come howl 
 If you read that user's larger prior talk-page revisions, you will see that the stated preference was to become named as """"Darryl98"""" so I am respecting that request. In changing names, that user was not aware of how people can be goaded into a WP:3RR excess of revisions, and that escalation seemed to be the most serious of the policy violations. It is not a violation to have multiple usernames on Wikipedia. Plus, as an occasional user, it seemed that Darryl98 had spent extensive time to read the policies about WP:Sockpuppetry and properly explained each issue as it applied in the situation: no clear violation of puppets, but rather just being accused of """"nefarious"""" intentions, which was noted as a violation of WP:AGF. Again, the largest disturbance was engaging in a WP:3RR violation, typically risking a 24-hour block, wh",0.0

My view on this is probably similar (but probably not identical) to Cirt's. Speaking for myself, I have two problems with the use of """"Calvinist"""" on this basis: (i) there are multiple ways that calling a website 'The Calvinist Corner'  the most obvious is that Slick is writing from a Calvinist perspective. Another might be that he is writing about Calvinism. To take the former as true, and draw the the conclusion that Slick is a Calvinist is an inference and thus WP:Synthesis. It's most probably true, but not the sort of thing we're meant to be doing on Wikipedia. (ii) There's a fairly strong Calvinist thread through much (most?) of conservative evangelical Christianity. There are probably dozens of articles where we could find a similar level of evidence for applying the word 'Calvinist'. We don't, and to my mind shouldn't, unless a WP:SECONDARY source feels it sufficiently relevant/important a description to make use of it. This means that such articles aren't 'loaded up' with true-but-of-doubtful-relevance WP:IINFO descriptions. I suspect that part of the problem is that much of the secondary-source writing concentrates on CARM rather than Slick personally. However this simply means that, per WP:DUE, we should follow suit.

The only vandal here is you. Let me clefify some things 4 you,

In the 19th century Ilija Garasanin and the rest of the Serb goverment of that time formed a program called """"Nacertanije"""", it was a plan of how to realize the plan of a Great Serbia  on the ruins of the Ottoman Empire. This new state would be rulled by Serbs, others would be subjected while Muslims(of any ethnicity) would be distroyed(by genocide sense it´s the only way). They called there Army chetnik, them selfs chetniks and there by this ideology(which is fashist) is chetnik. And any1 who follows it is a chetnik.

The plan failed untill 1918 when the Serbs managed to create a """"Slavic Kingdom"""" which was actually ment to become a Serb Kingdom which was with time shown, during WWII the chetniks allied with the Nazis and commited GENOCIDE. After the death of Tito the chetniks ressurected and tried everyting all over again but ones again failed thank God.

Now, the chetnik PROPAGANDA is used to make Serbs think that it is right to do all that and to foole everybothy else, this propaganda includes showing Bosnia as a """"Serb state"""", Bosniaks as  """"Serbs"""", spreding Islamophobia and Anti-Bosniak settlment or presenting the Serbs as the victoms and so on. THAT site does all that and it is enough to open it and you will see. Now you ain´t nobody so I don´t have to proove anything if you don´t see it then you are either stupid or a chetnik your self.

"I renamed this page from Havre, farm, Norway for several reason. The name was not standard wikipedia format (the ,farm , norway part of it), Havrå is an unique name (see Havre), after googling both havre and havrå, the havre (+osterøy) search led mostly to pages in Norwegian about the name change, while the Havrå search led to both English and Norwegian pages about the farm.

 Creation and Destruction 

I wanted to respond earlier, but I wasn’t sure if I should ever address you again, because you seemed very offended.  But I find you an interesting subject.  You’re a computer programmer like me, (but more advanced), you have a semblance of devotion, as far as I can tell, and you like KJV like me.  If I have offended you, then I hope you will accept my apology.

The bible does say a lot of things about the motivations of people, and I really didn’t intend to direct any verses at you personally.  I really want to have a prophet's eye view of the human race.

When I saw the discussion I noted that evidence was being given by both sides, and I felt a desire to step outside of that perspective for a bit and give my own testimony of how the Lord has led in my life concerning these issues.  Since the time I wrote that I have had a fascination to study Creation Science, and I have had some overwhelming discoveries; treasures which I would like to share.

Matthew 13:52  Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe [which is] instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man [that is] an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure [things] new and old.

Before I began to gather research, I suspected that there was already tons of evidence that would easily bury the Evolution Theory because it is a man-made theory designed by atheists to conveniently do away with moral responsibility to an intelligent Creator.  I realized that Adolf Hitler was huge fan of Evolution and thereby thought he was doing a good thing for mankind by eliminating the Jews, (but he only killed ~6 million).  Next on his list was the blacks.  His intention was to take over the whole world and progressively eliminate “inferior” races.  Of course there have been many other attempted genocides in the cause of progressing humanity by eliminating “weaker” races.  Some people may still sympathize with this cause.  We would call these racists and Neo-Nazis.  

“At some future period, not very distant as measured by centuries, the civilized races of man will almost certainly exterminate and replace, the savage races throughout the world.”  Charles Darwin, The descent of Man, chapter 3 and World Book Encyclopedia 1852, p. 336
“thus from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of higher animals, directly follows.”  Charles Darwin The Origin of Species… p. 243
“The standard of intelligence of the average adult Negro is similar to that of the eleven-year old youth of the species Homo sapiens.”  Henry Fairfield Osborn – Outspoken evolutionist and Curator of The American Museum of Natural History, New York
“No rational man, cognizant of the facts, believes that the average Negro is the equal, still less the superior, of the white man.”  Thomas Huxley (known as Darwin’s bulldog) 1871
Here’s a “theistic” evolutionist: “The Black People of Australia, exactly the same race as the African Negro, cannot take in the gospel… All attempts to bring them to a knowledge of the true God have as yet failed utterly... Poor brutes in human shape… they must perish off the face of the earth like brute beasts”  Kingsley C. Sermons on Natural Subjects Sermon XLI pp. 414-17, 1886, Charles Kingsley, an Anglican Priest who promoted Darwin.

A lot of people seem to feel more free if they convince themselves there is no Creator, but that people have evolved and just make their own gods and religions.
 """"With this single argument the mystery of the universe is explained, the Deity annulled, and a new era of infinite knowledge ushered in.”  Ernst Haeckel (“The Riddle of the Universe,” 1899, p. 337.) (This guy must have been high on PCP or something.  The theory he was explaining assumed that living cells are very simple.  This was before molecular biology.)
 “I suppose the reason we leaped at The Origin of Species was because the idea of God interfered with our sexual mores.” Thomas Huxley
 “I had motives for not wanting the world to have meaning; consequently assumed it had none, and was able without any difficulty to find satisfying reasons for this assumption.  For myself, as no doubt for most of my contemporaries, the philosophy of meaninglessness was essentially an instrument of liberation. The liberation we desired”  Aldous Huxley

But I’ve already explained why fallen man would want such a thing, and at the start I suspected, though I had not done so much research yet, there was already overwhelming evidence to verify the biblical account of creation and the flood.  Discussing the evidence may persuade some, but never all.  Jesus made it plain that no amount of evidence will persuade those that are not willing to be persuaded.

"Whoops! There was DOCUMENTATION for the Samson analogy being well received. And it's very true despite the protestations of GAY MAFIA who try to MANIPULATE wiki articles in order to advance their propaganda machine. I fought these NUTCASES tooth and nail a few years ago only to be GAMED or should I say GAYmed (haha) by them. These liberal LOONS use the rules  of Wiki to OSTRACIZE anyone who doesn't share their far left agenda.

It turns out that comparing Lonnie to Samson was a compliment and  not an attack on a 'dead gay man' as some gay advocate so dramatically (shocked! haha) suggested. Lonnie was NOT gay. He was a normal man who had been raped as a young boy much like Jerry Sandusky raped those little boys in the Penn State shower. This of course led Lonnie to engage in other gay activities despite his better judgement. The man himself did NOT want to practice homosexuality. But because of some GAY pedophile, he had his struggles.65.48.16.58",0.2857142857142857

Scholary Comment sounds like a red herring to me. It is fringe theory whether or not a couple of agenda promoting scholars have tried to draw a link. Slaves were disarmed-there is no question to that. States had militias for protection. Militias were used to put down a couple of slave revolts. Then some illogical thinking takes place and something like this follows: Militias are mentioned in the 2nd amendment and militias had put down slave revolts and thus the 2nd amendment is about surpressing slaves. That is an idiotic, illogical conclusion. The valid argument is suppressed people have had their right to bear arms denied. The Europeans are a suppressed people because as Article XVII of the Commonwealth of Mass. states:""""The people have a right to keep and to bear arms for the common defence. And as, in time of peace, armies are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be maintained without the consent of the legislature; and the military power shall always be held in an exact subordination to the civil authority, and be governed by it.""""

Shannon's Editing Comments:

Hello  I loved your beginning section on social support and found the definition of social support to be very helpful in my understanding. However, your second paragraph was a little too wordy for my liking and difficult to remain interested. Also, in your third paragraph """"with these types of communication.."""" you did not mention any types of communication before, and therefore you cannot use these, until after explaining each type of communication.  Finally, I would suggested maybe making your points in your verbal/non-verbal method section bulleted. Overall, you added great information to our article, take my suggestions as you wish.   

Hello  You added some great information, I am just concerned that it is all from one source, or have you not quite finished adding your additional citations? I really love your choice of bolding and italicizing your guidelines, however guideline three is not separate from guideline two, nor is it bold/italic. Finally there us a Which, in your final guildline that should not be capitalized. Great work Meagan, take my advice as you wish.   

Hello  You have made some great additions to our article, especially the use of the General Adaptive Syndrome. However, in stage three, stressor is missing a letter (small typo). You had a great point of how inadequate sleep leads to irritability, however, I suggest that you change """"less inclined to communicate"""" to less inclined to communicate effectively. Also, in your section of language barrier, you used the word intercultural, I believe interlingual is a more suitable term as culture is not only defined by language. For instance citizens of Quebec, have Canadian culture despite speaking a different language than most Canadians. Finally, the point on imaginary friend, might be a little far-fetched, but it would be fine to leave if you see fit. Great work overall!   

Thanks for the tips Shannon. I used them all! The interlingual suggestions was perfect!   23:""",0.0

"""The team was formed in 1977 by three ex-army motor cycle display team riders; Tony, Robin and Alan. Within a few weeks the team started building ramps and preparing motor cycles at Tony's workshop in Catford, S.E London.

New riders were trained for the first show which was at Mallory Park Race Track in Leicestershire. Early in 1978 preparations with George and Elstree Airport (North London) were made for Robin """"Smudger"""" Winter-Smith, to do a jump involving 31 Ford Escort vans. This along with a """"full team"""" stunt display took place on May 14th 1978. The jump was carried out successfully. Later that the team appeared on the ITV network's Saturday Banana Show, hosted by Bill Oddie, in which they performed stunts live on TV.

The team were then called upon to train Michael Crawford for an episode of his TV series """"Some Mothers' Do 'Ave 'Em."""" This episode was titled """"The Dispatch Ride,"""" Tony taught Michael some motor cycle tricks, in which Michael Performed very successfully. Tony also acted as a stunt coordinator while filming the show in 1978.

In 1980 team members worked on a film """"Silver Dream Racer."""" The star of this film was David Essex who was a very well known pop-star of this time. This year also saw two new members; John """"Golly"""" Goddard and Frank Welch, who were both training to jump with cars. 

In January 1982 the team along with """"Tina Roberts' Auto Angels"""" worked together, for """" Not The Nine O'Clock News """" which was a BBC TV programme. Both teams had a tremendous amount of fun whilst filming for the show. Tina now known as """"Firebird International"""" now travels and includes Pythons and singing with a band in her act. 
In May 1982 the team were performing in Brockley (South London). This was where John """"Golly"""" Goddard performed his first spectacular jump. He made a jump over 118 people laid down side by side. Later in the year on July 18th 1982 at the Chester Racecourse, John """"Golly"""" Goddard jumped successfully over 16 double decker buses , clearing a distance of 132ft. 

During the winter of 1982/3, Tony was busy working on a Kawasaki Z900 for a world record for """" 22 men on one motor cycle """". Once the bike was prepared the team and many friends went for the first practice. before the attempt was carried out many modifications were made. Once ready the team performed the event at the Santa Pod Raceway in Bedfordshire. The attempt was successful and placed the team into the Guinness Book of World Records. 
John """"Golly"""" Goddard was also preparing his next big jump, this time over 15 trucks. This successful jump took place on June 12th 1983 at Trentham Gardens, Staffordshire. 

The team took part in the """"Game For A Laugh"""" show hosted by Jeremy Beedle (amongst others) where the team's stunts were shown. John """"Golly"""" Goddard also successfully rode through 25 Walls of Fire for this programme. 

In 1989 Tony met Nikki, Nikki and her son James (9 at the time), they both became actively involved with the team, Nikki acting as a commentator and James began riding motor cycles and learning tricks on his PW 80. Lizzette Daniel and Sue Rees were female members of the team. 

In 1990 the team gained 2 World records. Chris """"Spin"""" Simpson set a new World record for 25 walls of fire; also Lee French jumped over 300 shopping trolleys at the Sussex County Showground, Ardingly, setting another new world record. 

Team members """" Vertical Vince """" and Chris Simpson started forming slow wheelies, Vertical Vince is probably the country's top rider performing wheelies. 

From 1992 Tony started to prepare a Suzuki Jeep for 2 wheel driving. After practicing for several weeks it was ready to perform in early 1993. Also 6 other Suzuki Jeeps were prepared for the team, for formation driving. This made the team unique as it was the only team performing this type of show. The next Jeep to be built was the """" Wheelie Jeep """" in 1995. In 1996 the """" Endo Jeep """" was built and this was driven by Tony for a challenge in the ITV programme """" You Bet"""". 

In 1998 Tony received a call from an agent with an unusual request for a motor cycle rider to promote a film by 20th Century Fox called """"Waking Ned"""". What made the request unusual was that they required a rider to to ride around Oxford Street, Trafalgar Square and Soho promoting the film,wearing nothing but a crash helmet and underpants . This was rather a chilly experience on a mid-September morning and this also received some very strange looks from people. 

Now the team performs 25-30 shows per year up and down the country. Tony and the team are busy with new ideas for the show. Brandon Bailey (Tony's son) just 9 years old already drives a Suzuki Jeep in the show, along with tricks on a motor cycle and a quad.

The article reads more like a left leaning op ed than an objective encyclopedic article. A good example is this unsourced assertion early in the article:

US conservatives didn't """"adopt"""" the term in the early 90s; it would be more accurate to say that by the early 90s the excesses of """"political correctness"""" became more widely known and many people (not just """"US conservatives"""") began to ridicule it (particularly as manifest in the implemnetation of draconian speech codes on college campuses and the aggressive promotion of increasingly dubious and absurd assertions of what might be construed as """"offensive""""). The term has come to be used in mischevous ways at times by people to ridicule positions they disagree with (an example would be creationsts categorizing the teaching of evolution as """"political correctness""""). 

The article in short seems to reflect the perspective of someone of an """"activist left"""" sensibility that is more interested in addressing popular backlash against political correctness than in objectively describing it. It's really not as complicated as the article makes it out to be. In brief, politically correctness is simply a word for efforts to alter or prohibit innocuous language or other activities that are unreasonably or implausibly asserted to be offensive. Unfortunately efforts to honestly describe it seem to be a magnet for what might be called """"political correctness denialists"""" (the idea that there is no such thing as political correctness; it's all just right wing agitprop etc.).""",0.0

Notice to Zscout370 about SimonP's and GroundZero's Arbitary Deletion

Howdy Zscout370,

This is just to let you know that I enjoyed our conversation very much about my contribution to the Flag of Canada page.  You very very professional, easy going and nice to talk too.  However, SimonP and GroundZero have seen fit to arbitarily deem my additions as """"POV warranting Deletion"""" without any discussion.  I am not happy about such """"blatant editoral presumption"""" on their parts.  I have have no prior dealings with GroundZero, but I am """"well acquainted"""" with SimonP's style.   He loves to add material without references and that retort that they are available in comtemptary Newpaper Articles.   A claim that is quite difficult to double check, as most people are not career librarians, or such.  

At any rate for the time being, I have taken the liberity to move my Republican Tricolour contributions to a separate page, linked below,

See also French Republican Tricolour form of Canadian Maple Leaf Flag.

Just to let yaa know, any blatant deletion/editing of this new page or the link to it on the Flag of Canada page, and I shall be asking you to contact the Administrations TO LOCK BOTH PAGES for Dispute Resolution.

The aim is to try to maintain the encyclopaedic nature of Wikipedia, and ensure it doesn't get used for advertising or biased opinions.

The reason I asked about a reference was because of the policy outlined in Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons – there are no particular problems with your statement about the book in this article, but in general all statements in articles about living people need to be verifiable via citations to reliable published sources.

Please I would like to know your sources for the number of Taliban killed in the War in Afghanistan.

Mentioning Darwin gave up natural selection and became a Lamarckian

The article currently makes no mention of the historically important fact that Darwin himself converted from the natural selection theory of evolution to a Lamarckian environmentalist position in later editions of The Origin of Species, which went into 6 different editions by 1872. Hence I propose the following insert at the first Darwin quotation in the current section ‘Publication of the theory of natural selection’, which I also propose should be retitled ‘Publication of the Darwin’s theory of evolution’.

Proposed insert:

'However,  even in the first edition of his book Darwin only claimed natural selection was the main means of selection, but not the only one. In the last sentence of its Introduction he said “Furthermore, I am convinced that natural selection has been the main but not exclusive means of modification.”

But by 1872 he had published six editions of the book with corrections and revisions, and in later editions in response to criticism of his theory of inheritance Darwin even gave up the theory of natural selection as the main selector of evolution, with its strong principle of inheritance, in favour of Lamarckian environmentalism, with a changing environment as the main selector. As C.D. Darlington wrote in 1950 in his Foreword to a new and first reprint of the otherwise unavailable first edition of The Origin:

""""Let no one imagine, however, that, in the world of science, Darwin's theory has enjoyed an unchequered prosperity. On the contrary the dust of battle is only now beginning to settle on the hotly disputed ground....The most abiding source of trouble was that discovered  by the Professor of Engineering at Edinburgh. Professor Fleming[sic] Jenkin pointed out in 1867, that any new variation appearing in one individual would be lost or swamped in later generations when that individual was compelled to cross with others of the old and established type, and its differences, as Darwin believed, blended in inheritance. Nature would never be able to keep any differences to select. 

Darwin's defence against this objection was already prepared. He had hinted it in the first edition of The Origin of Species: at the end of the Introduction he had said that """"Natural Selection has been the main but not exclusive means of modification."""" In later editions he hedged further. He fell  back on the other means. These depended chiefly on the action of a changing environment: its direct effect in altering living things so as to suit it must be inherited. In adopting this view Darwin was giving up his own, and Wallace's, peculiar claim to originality: he was giving up the argument implied in the title of the book: and he was falling back on the discarded and disreputable theory of Lamarck."""" 
[p. xvii On the Origin of Species by means of Natural Selection first edition reprint in The Thinker's Library by Watts & Co, 1950.] '

But Darlington failed to establish Lamarck's theory was discarded or disreputable. In fact the theory of natural selection only became accepted in the mid-20th century with the ‘Mendelian-Darwinian synthesis’ in population genetics. But even by 1950 Darwinism was still not accepted in academia according to Darlington:

""""In view of the triumph of his ideas it might be thought that Darwinism, in all civilised countries, would be taught as one of the foundations of thought, that in the universities everywhere it would be critically expounded and experimentally developed. That is true of its remote and general applications to such sciences as astronomy and geology. But where, as in its applications to ourselves, in the study of the genetics of men, and to the histories of nations, as exact knowledge of the principles of variation, hybridization and selection is required, we hear on every side nothing but confused and ignorant speculations. At the same time the foundation of Darwinism in the experimental study of evolution has largely been smothered in Darwin's own country. The Universities, with their museums and botanic gardens, are happy to forget what, in 1859, they were unable to resist. They contain no memorial of his work,  and all the means of developing his doctrine they frustrate by an arrangement of teaching which the theory of evolution is not allowed to disturb. The old pedantic learning of botany and zoology, which Darwin treated as one subject, they continue to cleave asunder, burying the halves under their ancient schedules of instruction."""" [‘’ibid’’ pxviii-xix]. '

I also propose the following edit of the article's introduction:

His 1859 book ‘’On the Origin of Species’’ posited natural selection was the main selector in the evolution and origin of species, but by its 1872 sixth edition Darwin had abandon",0.0

Brother
it's not worth it to try to dispute with someone who is enemy of afghanistan. you should realize that there are many admininstrators who also view afghanistan as an enemy because of what happened after 9-11 and so on. this affects everything here, my friendly advice to you is to let these vandals write whatever they want. searching for trustful sources, reading and learning is the best fun. however, disputing with these people is the worst thing, it will create tension and make you very frustrated, and that is what they want you to be. don't force people to learn if they don't wanna learn. i say, let people remain stupid if that is what they want. i know these vandals from another place online, they are pure racist group, anti-afghanistan, anti-afghan, anti-pashtun, anti-karzai, anti-government of afghanistan. they are religiously """"shias"""", one of them is crippled who rides in a wheel chair, his dad was killed in afghanistan in tha past and he is using that against afghanistan. since that one is crippled, he has nothing else in life but to stay home all the time and falsify afghanistan related articles as a way to take his personal revenge for his father.

 Role in Russian civil war 

That section states the Bolsheviks won that war in the late 1919. That is completely wrong by any historic books and textbooks. Officially the war ended in 1922, but there was still fighting going on in the Russian Far East. That is what the Soviet historical textbooks say. For some reason the war with the Ukraine is being perceived as the Civil war in Soviet times and it seems that the same trend exist today as well. That is also wrong. Ukraine was a recognized state by the Soviet Russia as well as by the other numerous countries. That was a straight aggresion against the Ukrainian republic, following an unbelievable slaughtering of population in Ukraine by bolsheviks (Kyiv and Podillia still remembered). In 1920 Ukraine united with Poland to stop the bolshevik bandits. The Soviet textbooks state that it was an intervention of the """"White"""" Polish burgouis, relating it to the Russian white movement which is way off. 

Not on the subject of the section, but Stalin should be recognized as the enemy of the world and, at least, should be on the same page with Adolf Hitler. Stalin was way more evil. Not all of his wrongdoings are uncovered, but the one that already are known can easily convict the guy. His name should be cursed for the eternity and humanity needs to learn to avoid the next Stalin.   

Define """"convict."""" What exactly is Stalin guilty of? Killing off men and women that he believed threatened the unity and safety of his nation? Knights did that all the time. Under Stalin, the Soviet Union became incredibly well-developed, albeit uncaring towards others. They even beat us in the space race. I'm sure all of our wonderful presidents would have thought that would happen with the amazing ideals of wonderful democracy. Luna RainHowLCry

 Semi-protected edit request on 8 January 2014 

Please remove this page from my Facebook page.  This is not
my high school nor did I teach at this high school.  Thank you,  Jude Johnson

  
  Not done: please be more specific about what needs to be changed.   

 Use in Belgium and The Netherlands.. way off. 

Not only does the paragraph not explain the """"Hogeschool"""" (literal translation) system that provides Associate and Bachelor degrees, the information it provides about secondary education is wrong in some key points. Since I can't directly edit, I thought I might sum it up here.

Children are required to attend school from 6 to 18 in Belgium and 5 to 18 in The Netherlands or until they attain a specific level of education (BE: any secondary education, NL: HAVO, VWO or a level 2 MBO). See Dutch government website on 'leerplicht' and Flemish regional government's page on the same subject. Not relevant for Hogeschool, but faulty info in the article nontheless.

Dutch MBO is not considered school for the first two years, it is always considered school (unlike a """"Hogeschool"""", that functions as a University in terms of application, funding etc).

Now I don't know exactly how the Flemish equivalent of Hogeschool/High-school is used, but i'll sum up how it works in the Netherlands from the lowest level up until Hogeschool (usually translated as """"University of Applied Sciences""""). I'll skip internal stuff on VMBO and MBO, basically VMBO level determines MBO starting leve and you can always go up a MBO level(1-4) if you want to spend the time.

MBO level 4 provides access to almost all(1) Hogeschool Associate (120 ECTS) and Bachelor (240 ECTS) programs. Associate degrees are more of a technicality, unknown to employers and unused in most programs, but they exist.
Completing the first year (also known as Propedeuse) of a Hogeschool program grants access to almost all(1) University Bachelor programs.

1)Additional requirements may be set, usually involving math or language courses attended.

Hogescholen (and Universities) must offer access to their Associate and Bachelor programs to potential students aged 21 and up via 'Colloquium Doctum'. Here's some more info from a Dutch University in English on that subject, including a reference to the article of Dutch law about 'Colloquium Doctum'. The same system is often used when potential students lack certain courses from previous studies.

Regarding the article as a whole, it seems to lack sources overall, I feel it should be open for editing or otherwise overhauled to apply only to the term """"high school"""" and it's literal translations, redirecting to articles about secondary/higher education if needed.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 82.171.32.96   

 Is high school in comics a valid category? About half of super hero's are teenagers. 

I think this is as valid a category as zoos in fiction; these are both settings that are only really told by specific kind of stories. Teen and animal adventure.   

:Category:Fictional schools and its subcategory Category:Superhero schools already exist.   

Teenaged superheros are not fictional schools. They might be fictional high school students and or fictional teenagers. In many cases, however, those will not be defining characteristics. - [[User:SummerPhD|Summer",0.0

Speedy deletion of I.D.milano Product Design
 A tag has been placed on I.D.milano Product Design requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a company or corporation, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for companies and corporations. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

Dear Mark:

If you are not yet sick of history merges, here's one that is a little strange.  This article Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Guns and Robots was developed up to a certain point in Feruary, then the changes pick up with the same editors at Guns and Robots (video game) until a few days ago, and a redirect was created at Guns and Robots pointing to this article.  Then a totally different editor, transferred all of the text to the redirect page and made a redirect out of the page which had been the article.  No reason given on the talk pages.  I personally feel that the pages were correct before the move, but I am not an expert on the conventions of page naming.  In any case, the history of Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Guns and Robots needs to be appended to Guns and Robots (video game), not to Guns and Robots as it would appear from a casual look.

Hello.

I'm aware of that but I don't want to edit posts and get blocked again hence I'd like an advisor/mentor to guide me on here first so once I post it I wouldn't have any trouble.

For example """""""". I wish to edit the page """"Muslim conquest of Persia"""" and add these sections to them as they are historical facts.

Mass massacre and conversion
According to available documents such as the Shahnameh (Book of Kings) by Ferdowsi (Persian Poet) who took on the great role on preserving the Persian language from being lost; by the order of the Arab commander “Yazid ibn al-Muhallab” in north of Persia, Gorgan, many Persians were beheaded so that their blood, mixed with water would energize the millstone to produce as much as one day's meal for him. As Yazid ibn al-Muhallab had vowed and ordered his soldiers to cut off the tongue of anyone who dared to speak Persian. This is why in Arabic, Persians are called “Ajam”, meaning mute. The event of blood mill has been quoted by the generations of historians and Persian (Iranian) """"Zoroastrian"""" families to this day. In recent years however, disenchanted Iranian scholars have been writing about the blood mills and this event has been reported by Iranian historians of the Islamic era. On the way to Mazandaran Province (Northern Iran), Yazid ibn al-Muhallab also ordered 12,000 Persian captives to be hanged at the two sides of the road so that the victorious Arab army could pass through. Upon arrival, many more were massacred in that province and heavy tax (Jizya) was imposed on the survivors who did not convert to Islam.

Some historians have estimated that a total of 400,000 Persian (Iranian) civilians were massacred. After the battle of Ali, the Arab commander (Khalid ibn al-Walid) ordered all the prisoners of war be decapitated so that a creek of blood flows. When the city of “Estakhr” in the south of Iran put up a stiff resistance against the Arab invaders, 50,000 residents were slaughtered. One of the battles by the Arabs has been named, “Jelovla” (Covered), because an estimated 100,000 bodies of the slain Persian soldiers covered the desert.

It is reported that 130,000 Persian women and children were enslaved and sold in the Mecca and Medina markets and large amounts of gold and silver were plundered. One respected Iranian scholar recently wrote, “Why so many had to die or suffer? Because one side was determined to impose his religion upon the other who could not understand”. The Arabs colonized, exploited, raped and despised the Persians (Iranians). They even named the Persian converts “Mawali” or “Liberated Slaves”.

Persian rebellion

Babak Khorramdin was one of the main Iranian (Persian) iconic rebels against the Arab invasion. He alongside his wife (Banu Khorramdin) fought against the Arabs for an estimated time of 23 years and won every battle. Records show that Babak and his army of Khurramites killed over 500,000 invading Arabs.

Caliph Umar, who was behind the conquest of Persia was assassinated in November 644 by a Persian who had been enslaved Pirouz Nahavandi. Piruz was also behind the murder of Ali, however knowledge of Piruz's death is unclear.  Hormuzan is said to have masterminded this plot. Caliph Uthman ibn Affan (644–656) succeeded Umar. During his reign almost the whole of the former Sassanid empire's territory rebelled from time to time until 651, until the last Sassanid emperor Yazdegerd III was assassinated near Merv ending the Sassanid dynasty and Persian (Iranian) resistance to the Muslims. The main rebellion was in the Persian provinces of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Fars Province (Pars), Sistan in 649, Tabaristan, Khorasan (651), and Makran (650).

 Article Licensing 

Hi, I've  to get users to multi-license all of their contributions that they've made to either (1) all U.S. state, county, and city articles or (2) all articles, using the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike  (CC-by-sa) v1.0 and v2.0 Licenses or into the public domain if they prefer.  The CC-by-sa license is a true free documentation license that is similar to Wikipedia's license, the GFDL, but it allows other projects, such as WikiTravel, to use our articles.  Since you are among the top 1000 Wikipedians by edits, I was wondering if you would be willing to multi-license all of your contributions or at minimum those on the geographic articles.  Over 90% of people asked have agreed.  For More Information:
Multi-Licensing FAQ - Lots of questions answered
Multi-Licensing Guide

To allow us to track those users who muli-license their contributions, many users copy and paste the """"{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}"""" template into their user page, but there are other options at Template messages/User namespace.  The following examples could also copied and pasted into your user page:

Option 1
I agree to [[Wikipedia:Multi-licensing|multi-license]] all my contributions, with the exception of my user pages, as described below:
{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}
OR
Option 2
I agree to [[Wikipedia:Multi-licensing|multi-license]] all my contributions to any [[U.S. state]], county, or city article as described below:
{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}

Or if you wanted to place your work into the public domain, you could replace """"{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}"""" with """"{{MultiLicensePD}}"""".  If you only prefer using the GFDL, I would like to know that too.  Please let me know what you think at my talk page.  It's important to know either way so no one keeps asking.

""":Hello Summer song, I have reverted eschatology back to the main page. Eschatology has nothing whatsoever to do with """"opposition to Jehovah's Witnesses"""".

On arriving at the convention, Fauja Singh tried to behead the Nirankari leader with his sword but was shot by the leader's bodyguard. The brawl that ensued thereafter, left 13 of the raiding party dead, including two of Bhindranwale’s followers. Another eleven of the Akhand Kirtani Jatha were killed. Three Nirankaris were also killed. Bhindranwale himself was reported to have fled the scene just as the violence broke out which damaged relations between him and the Akhand Kirtani Jatha.

"Adamslinger, firstly I suggest you go back and read the policy on Conflict of Interest I provided above which provides an explanation as to how an editor who has any connection with the article or text should behave. Secondly, regarding the Recruitment article your reference to the content having been lifted from your article I have gone back to look in August when it was added only to find you had added this content yourself see here. Such a blatant bit of copyright violation see WP:COPYVIO and conflict of interest justifies its removal straight away which I will do shortly. Frankly, it would have been a bit more transparent if you had said it was you who had lifted it! Turning to the Sainsbury's article and reference to Jamie Oliver I have remedied this by adding an article from The Grocer which addresses the need for a citation. There is no way you could add this citation back in yourself nor given what we know now about the article in ATM could it be valid for anyone else to use this citation now without it been see as vicariously offending WP:PROMO. 

Probably the best takeaway piece of advice the various policies provide which I have oft seen repeated by Admins is for those with any possible or perceived conflict or close association / connection with an subject area or article or specific content is to avoid editing directly, and if making any suggestions on the Talk Page always state your connection with the article etc. There is also little patience with those who abuse these policies and bans and blocks are quite normal.

 Epiwafer 

I am surprised to learn that """"epiwafer"""" was a popular term right around 2000-2002, the exact time that my company started to use epi wafers.  I should pay more attention to ads, I guess.  Anyway, it quickly settled back to more normal terminology, like """"epitaxial wafer"""", looks like.  I guess another move is in order.    

Hi , I think it best to look at all those Google searches on the Talk page, and see which spelling/nomenclature  adding the web + book, singular + plural spellings (that's four searches for each spelling)  has the most hits, for the title of the article. If you want, I can do that and add them up. Of course, the company name will skew """"epiwafer"""" so we can exclude that if you like.   
We don't use plurals, and book searches are generally more authoritative than web searches, but feel free to provide more data.    
Plurals are for the Google searches, because obviously many of the mentions (even in books) are only in plural, not singular, so an exact-phrase Google search (i.e., in quotation marks) will omit those mentions unless a plural form is searched. I'm fine with the fully spelled-out version as long as all of the other spellings redirect to it; therefore should probably also create a redirect for Epi-wafer, since that hyphenated form is sometimes used as well.

 Clarification on Wikipedia naming standards 

Hi Kohikoi,

You just left a message on my talkpage where you immediately threatened to block me out of the blue instead of a friendly suggestion or attempt to discuss/investigate. I would like to remind you that Wikipedia:Administrator_Code_of_Conduct | Wikipedia admin code of conduct}} guidelines specifically state...

threatening a user with an inappropriate block is just as bad behavior as actually making that block
admins should never use their admin abilities to intimidate others

To deal with your concerns though. From my tandpoint I just corrected a breach of Wikipedia naming standards that appear politically motivated. However,you just suggested the current version of these pages are the result of a long-standing consensus between several users. Do you have evidence of this consensus? (i.e Where exactly is it reported on Wikipedia?) As far as I can tell the page for  naming conventions of Greek and Turkish named places specifically states... 

""""This Wikipedia page is currently inactive and is retained as a historical archive. Either the page is no longer relevant or consensus has become unclear. If you want to revive discussion regarding the subject, you should seek broader input via a forum such as the proposals page of the village pump.""""

Furthermore, I have to ask why is there suddenly a special page only for Greek/Turkish naming conventions in the first place? The standards proposed on that page appear to directly contridict broader Wikipedia naming standards which state...

Use modern English names for titles and in articles. Historical names or names in other languages can be used in the lead if they are frequently used and important enough to be valuable to readers, and should be used in articles with caution.

I'm a a hotheaded newb so perhaps I'm missing something here. Any insight would be appreciated """,0.0

This was a very informative article and it is highly recommended. It needs more information about how to deal with intellectualy dihonesty on Wikipedia. There are some regular writers on Wikipedia who knowingly engage in personal attacks and deletions (even of links) of anyone who explains the connection between Edward Bellamy and his cousin Francis Bellamy (author of the pledge of allegiance) and National Socialism. Some of the worst falsifiers on Wikipedia are Stormie, Lupo, and Matt Crypto. They were challenged to respond to the facts that they suppressed or to concede, and they each conceded that the facts that they suppress are correct and that they delete those facts because they do not want Wikipedia readers to know the truth. They constantly spam their own point of view in their diatribes in which they try to cover up for Nazism. It is behavior that breaks Wikipedia's rules. What kind of people cover-up for Nazis and that horrid ideology?

Many regular writers on Wikipedia are intellectually dishonest  and they regurgitate the top media cover-ups.  They cover up many historic photos of the Pledge of Allegiance http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html that reveal its original straight-arm salute.  They cover up the fact that the author of the Pledge of Allegiance (Francis Bellamy), and his cousin and cohort (Edward Bellamy), were National Socialists and supported the """"Nationalism"""" movement, the """"Nationalist"""" magazine, the """"Nationalist Educational Association,"""" their dogma of """"military socialism,"""" and Edward inspired the """"Nationalist Party.""""  They cover up the Pledge's straight-arm salute as the origin http://rexcurry.net/pledge1.html of the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis). As part of the cover up, they perpetuate the myth http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html that the straight-arm salute was from ancient Rome.  They cover up discoveries by the historian Rex Curry.  The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html showing the evolution of the gesture. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html is an extended military salute. A mnemonic device is the swastika (""""Hakenkreuz"""" in German).   Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent """"S"""" letters for their """"socialism.""""  Hitler altered his own signature http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html to use the same stylized """"S"""" letter for """"socialist."""" Wikipedia's fibbers cover up for the swastika http://rexcurry.net/swastikanews.html and its use as a sick socialist symbol. Wikipedia's dissemblers cover up for the National Socialist German Worker's Party http://rexcurry.net/swastikamedia.html by overuse of the hackneyed shorthand """"Nazi.""""  Many Wikipedia posters are propagandists in that there was no """"Nazi Party"""" because it was actually the """"National Socialist German Workers' Party"""" and the party members did not call themselves """"Nazis"""" nor the """"Nazi Party.""""  The term """"Nazi"""" developed from slang using the first syllable in the German pronunciation of the """"National Socialist German Workers' Party.""""  In that sense, the author of the Pledge of Allegiance was a """"Nazi"""" too, in that the term means """"National Socialist.""""  The term """"Nazi"""" is also used to hide the National Socialist dogma behind the Pledge of Allegiance, its original gesture, and the National Socialist German Workers' Party.  

Wikipedia's cons use the term """"Nazi"""" and the misnomer """"Nazi Party"""" to cover-up the horrors of socialism. Wikipedia's falsifiers cover up the the socialist trio of atrocities and and their socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part): 62 million people were slaughtered under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 35 million were slaughtered under the Peoples' Republic of China; 21 million were slaughtered under the National Socialist German Workers' Party. They cover up the fact that socialists helped start WWII with the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics together  http://rexcurry.net/socialistwar.html as allies in 1939. They cover up for and are deniers of the socialist Wholecaust, http://rexcurry.net/mediacoverup.html of which the monstrous Holocaust was a part.

Liars on Wikipedia repeat common lies http://rexcurry.net/mediapledge.html of the media. http://rexcurry.net/socialistmedia.html

Wikipedia should not be cited for support because it is no different than quoting various anonymous sources who have no knowledge of the topic http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html or who have fibs to spread about the topic.

"The link in the most recent comment by JohnInDC is one to a site with links to sites describing the U.S. Capitol. Whoever designed that link may not have known that the plan was  Ellicott's, rather than L'Enfant's. That also seems to be the case at Arlington Cemetery, where a historical marker in front of L'Enfant's grave illustrates Ellicott's Plan, rather than L'Enfant's original plan.  As L'Enfant objected to Ellicott's revisions in his letters, he would probably not be very happy about this misidentification. Fortunately, his grave is covered by a slab containing a copy of a portion of his own plan.  However, the public usually only sees the copy of Ellicott's plan (or revision). 

As to the caption of the pictures on the Wikipedia pages, the people who have commented above should all visit the website describing the Library of Congress' holdings of L'Enfant's and Ellicott's plans in the Library's catalog at http://lccn.loc.gov/95860578.   The summary of the holdings states:   “Summary: Includes plans by Pierre L'Enfant (facsimile maps published in 1887 by the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey) and Andrew Ellicott (1792) and … “.  

In its most definitive site, the Library of Congress therefore identifies the plan in the Wikipedia pages as Ellicott’s plan.  I will leave it to others to revise the caption on the plan in the Wikepedia pages, as I do not want to revise it again myself.",0.0

Even the Wikipedia Administrators who have complained to me about my reverts and re-edits have admitted and openly SAID that ANYONE has the right to edit ANY page, as long as they do not violate the 3-Revert-24 Rule; if you care, go back and review where they said that multiple times.

I have every right to edit any article at least once per day; and my posts consist mainly of ADDITIONS to articles, not deleting portions of other people's contributions. All of my contributions involve generally adding additional information, opposing viewpoints and the pewrspective of critics; ALl my opponents edits consist of deleting my contributions and trying to silence my participation here.

So go ahead, try totally freezing me. I will simply write to the Wikipedia headquarters and request that they review the official record, and your biased actions and statements. I will quickly be restored to my privileges, because you have no case, and you are just harrasing me because of whatever prejudices, bias or immature resentments you harbor.

I could never be humiliated or embarrassed by a small person like you; administrators of your ilk have already demonstrated that you would be better taking kindergarten and grammar school over again than trying to manage and lead other people who have achieved adulthood long ago.

 p values and the 0.05 standard 

Hi, I'm curious about the origins of the 0.05 p -value standard and didn't want to continue the discussion on the homeopathy talk page, so I hope you don't mind a question here.  I admittedly oversimplified my statement about 0.05 being arbitrary, mainly in an effort to save space and not overexert myself in addressing another editor.  Clearly, """"arbitrary"""" was not the best word, but what I'm curious about is the origins of two standard deviations being established as the cut off for significance.

 Another Question 

Hello again.
I have read through the links, they are very helpful.  Thanks.  I have made the changes to the headings and subheadings, italics instead of bolds and moved the external links to a """"links"""" section rather than in the article.  I have changed the footnotes (thanks for help on that!)and I believe I did as you instructed for the reference list but a strange thing has happened in the Reference section of my article.  I have the references repeating themselves multiple times.  I am not sure what I have done to get this result?

Also, I am interested in building a """"sidebar"""" with a picture and summary of Mulford's life (similar to what is found on Carl Sagan's Wikipage) but for one thing, I don't know what to call it so I can't search for help on creating it within the article.  Can you direct me further?

I believe I have otherwise met the verifiable and reliable sources requirement (although I admit that I have wondered if interviews/personal diaries can be considered valued biographical sources in Wikepedia); I believe I am maintaining a neutral point of view, and I believe Mulford's life to be notable as evidenced by the large collection at UCF of his life's work.  

Once I have everything done I'd like to ask for one last """"preview"""" to see if you see any other glaring problems.

"Correction to Karljoos 
Karljoos, you ignorantly state that the phillipines is a hispanic country? How in the hell is that possible? Phillipino people are not spaniard nor have there been any admixture between spaniards and phillipines over the centuries. Are you ok?

Also, according to europeans (not ignorant americans), hispanic is an admixture of races in south america. Therefore, spaniards are not classified as hispanic. 

Then you state that Spanish culture has taken root in south america. This is not wholly true. Although it is true that south americans have accepted parts of Spanish culture, they still retain features of their own culture that are extremely distinct from the Spanish culture. This is compounded further by south america’s distinct racial differences, which, if you were smart, you would indeed know.

Just for the record, I am of spaniard descent. I do not consider myself hispanic in the way that ignorant stupid americans do. All europeans don’t view spaniards as hispanic, as a matter of fact. 

Also, since stupid americans consider south americans hispanic, it should be therefore fair to classify afro-americans and native americans in america as anglo-saxons also. This is due to the fact that afro-americans and native americans possess a significant amount of their bloodline to anglo-saxon admixture. As a result, I will add this fact to wikipedia’s anglo-saxon article. AND I WILL BACK THIS UP WITH GOOD SOURCES. So, I better not get idiot americans disputing this.",0.2857142857142857

"Here are my thoughts on the questions you've posed:
Which of the places on the list are notable enough for separate articles (if they don't have one now)?  I've added links to articles where I could them.  I'd say articles are also needed at least for Sugar Creek,  Red Butte, Rocky Ridge, Echo Canyon, and Emigration Canyon.  A couple of points of interest that could be added are Genoa, Nebraska (settled by the Latter-day Saints as a supply point) and This Is The Place Heritage Park.  I'm sure other landmarks will be identified with additional research.
Which places could be reasonably combined in sections, like the eastern Wyoming sites? Some suggested sections:  Iowa (mostly covering the 1840s); the Missouri River area (Winter Quarters / Kanesville / Florence); Missouri River to Fort Laramie; For Laramie to Fort Bridger (with a focus on the handcart companies); and Fort Bridger to Salt Lake Valley.  The Iowa section could include a brief subsection on the route used by the handcart companies from Iowa City to Florence.
And how are we to deal with elapsed time, as early companies had different experiences than later companies?  One chunk for geography and another for linear time? I think the organization of the Mormon Trail article should focus on geography.  Content that is intrinsically chronological could be moved to the Mormon Pioneer article.  Would it make sense to tackle both of these articles at once to try to ensure that they compliment each other without simply being repetitive?—",0.0

"Link Building strategies 

Link building is the practice of getting other sites to link back to your website. This can often be done using a wide variety of strategies, such as:

Asking for a link
Giving away content or tools
Widget development
Social media campaigns
Purchasing links and more….
But first, let’s start with the basic theories…

* Why Link Building Matters

Whenever any user enters a query into a search engine, the search engine needs to determine how to return the best results. How? There are two key steps:
Figure out which pages on the web are related in any way to the query
Evaluate which of the pages that relate to the query are the most important
Each link to a web page is seen as a vote for that web page.
In simple terms, if there are two pages that are equally relevant to a given search query, the page with the better inbound link profile will rank higher than the other page (being all other factors equal).
Hence, the need of Link Building!

*How Search Engines Evaluate Links

Each link to a web page is a vote for that web page.
That implies the higher the PR, the more the value of that vote. This is partially true. But, two votes may not have equal weight even if they are from same PR page.
Value of vote depends on – Relevance and Authority
Now let’s take a deeper look at these factors…

* Relevance Factor

Here are some other hints and tips:

 I would recommend that you get a username.  You don't have to log in to read or edit articles on Wikipedia, but creating an account is quick, free and non-intrusive, requires no personal information, and there are many benefits of having a username.  (If you edit without a username, your IP address is used to identify you instead.)
 When using talk pages, please sign your name at the end of your messages by typing four tildes (~~~~). This will automatically produce your username (or IP address) and the date.

If you have any questions, check out Wikipedia:Questions, ask me on , or type  {{helpme}}  on this talk page and a user will help you as soon as possible. I will answer your questions as far as I can.  Again, welcome, and I hope you enjoy editing here and being a Wikipedian. ~ Riana ⁂ """,0.0

Others' comments

It is not necessary to bring talk pages to publishing standards, so there is no need to correct typing errors, grammar, etc. It tends to irritate the users whose comments you are correcting.  

Never edit someone's words to change their meaning. Editing others' comments is not allowed. There are exceptions, however. Some are:
 If you have their permission
 Removing prohibited material such as libel and personal details
 Removing personal attacks and incivility. This is controversial, and many editors do not feel it is acceptable; please read WP:ATTACK#Removal of text and WP:CIVIL#Removing uncivil comments before removing anything.
 Unsigned comments: You are allowed to append  or one of its variants to the end of someone's comment if they have failed to sign it. The form is {{subst:unsigned|USER NAME OR IP}}, which results in —The preceding unsigned comment was added by  (talk • contribs) ..
 Interruptions: In some cases, it is OK to interrupt a long contribution, either by a short comment (as a reply to a minor point) or by a headline (if the contribution introduces a new topic). In that case, add """"Headline added to (reason) by ~~~~""""). In such cases, please add {{subst:interrupted|USER NAME OR IP}} before the interruption.
 When a long comment has formatting errors, rendering it difficult to read. In this case, restrict the edits to formatting changes only and preserve the content as much as possible.
 On your own user talk page, you may remove comments from others, although archiving is generally preferred. The text of another user's comment, however, may never be directly edited to misrepresent the person or change the meaning of the comment.

I sort of understand about the Midland thing, but where did you get your information about /ay/ and the allophones of /ey/?

I'll admit I thought that was a bit weird too, but there must have been a reason they narrowly transcribed it that way.  It doesn't say in that book that the phenomenon that's occurring in Philadelphia is exactly the same thing as what's going on in Canada, so the allophone could be slightly different than that of Canada.  It also said there was a general raising and fronting of /i/ and /eɪ/; it didn't say anything about raising and fronting only occurring before consonants.

Hi, Rick Norwood. Funny but I find just the opposite to be true. Badly written edits, i.e. blatant attempts at removing meaning from articles, are mostly done by left-leaning (socialist, modern liberal, etc.) editors. Also, the large majority of editors, and not suprisingly, admins here at the wiki, are socialist and in general left-leaning and are dominating many of the political articles. The meaning of words, the correct charictarization of ideologies, and history itself, is being altered. This article is a prime example of this aricle take-over and the propaganda that is being strongly pushed here. I predict it will be the downfall of Wikipedia. This is sad to me because, what could have been a free and inclusive collaberation of knowledge, has been turned into a giant machine that spits out non-fact, censorship, and well, just plain propagandistic cow flop.

He had to use that 'In Common Speech' term because Lord Nimmo Smith knows that in Law, Rangers FC formed in 1872 are officially liquidated. There's your difference. That's what the 'Old Firm' term is: In common speech but not strictly official.",0.0

Comments

I liked it.  Rare is an article which is not only well documented but also interesting.  

I'm a stickler for comma use, so I went ahead and fixed three small errant commas in the article.

As to content, I would raise only two points.  At note 64, you say something like this: """"There was an attempt to assassinate the king.""""  Rather than saying """"There was . . .,"""" I think a better phrasing would be to use the actor as the subject and an action verb.  That is, """"A group of landowners attempted to kill the king.""""  Is it known who was behind the attempt?  

Second, I see that some other people have commented about one-sentence paragraphs.  I wonder if a correction of that did not produce the paragraph at note 71.  that paragraph begins with the topic sentence saying that brewing was becoming popular in the area.  Then, the whole rest of the paragraph has to do with witch trials.  Were those things linked in some way?  Perhaps cut the first sentence free again and add a follow up line about the volumes of beer that were being brewed or something.

I hope these comments are not too pedantic.  I'm new to peer reviewing anything.  Also, I am totally in the dark about formatting for notes, so I've not even attempted to weigh in on those.""",0.0

 Statistic removal 

I am removing the statistics from the 4th paragraph for the following reasons:

 The source [] qualifies as a WP:Primary by definition of a primary source
 The source is not an original study in and of itself, but is instead a """"meta-study"""" based on the """"RCTs"""". The underlying RCTs were not random or controlled as I indicated earlier by the Gregory Boyle and George Hill research; my previous posts here linked to their research which is a reliable source.
 The sentence I'm removing is a an opinion of the researchers themselves and is not directly supported by the results. See []. The actual reduction is not statistically significant. See Statistical_significance. The """"gold standard"""" is ~5%.
 I cannot obtain the source article in question without paying for it, but it really doesn't matter since we're not supposed to be using primary sources directly anyway. Both the monitor.co.ug and the aforementioned research goes to discredit the research
 Prostitution, when taken into account, nullifies the """"benefits"""": []
 Additional secondary source finding no benefit of MGM: []
 Another secondary source discrediting the research based on non-sexual HIV acquisition. See citations at the following link: []
 See citations here; male-female transmission increased: []
 Commentary that RCTs were not random at all (this is a fact as participants were paid): []
 No relationship between MGM & HIV in Kenya: []

Unlike the primary source in question, I've posted numerous links to reliable sources here. It would be easy to justify removing additional statements based on the source in question, but let's start with this one.   """,0.0
