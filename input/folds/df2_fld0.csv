If you make $40,000/year, that's basically your take-home after taxes. So, unless both partners are high wage earners, it usually makes more economic sense for one to stay home.

"> Because once a biological woman has undergone sex change or transitioned, they are then a male.

This sentiment supports the concept of your sex/gender being based on your external physical attributes. It ignores that your brain is very much a physical component of your body, and it's there in the brain that people are Male or Female or SomethingElse.

There is no ""becoming a woman"" or ""becoming a man"". There are only techniques people use to make their outward appearance align with their internal sense of self so they don't feel a jarring reaction every time someone says they are something they are not.

I would strongly encourage you to educate yourself more on this issue, because you'll draw a lot of false conclusions if you don't understand the nature of how sex/gender really behaves scientifically as well as socially/culturally.

Men aren't allowed to cry because women are the emotional ones. Men can't be raped because they're the ""stronger"" sex so should be able to fight off the ""weaker"" sex plus they're supposed to always want sex (toxic masculinity).

Grooming is the key here, a brother whom is several years older than little sister, lightly exposes her to ideas, then the trust that is built up through the years gets abused. Same with daddy and daughter.

"You said you're capable and willing to defend these arguments so I'll start with two simple questions:

What reason is there to believe objective moral values exist? I've never had a theist answer this question with anything but an appeal to emotion or popularity, or to ridicule moral relativism in place of it.

How can one possibly take a resurrection event as anything but near-zero probability in their Bayesian analysis without first already arguing that a god exists (therefore miracles can happen) and thus how are you not making a circular argument?",0.5315845824411135

"When anybody (whether gay or straight) just.. aggressively turns the conversation towards sexual topics that serve to highlight (over and over) their sexual preferences/practices. Like damn, I don't think that anybody here is uncomfortable about you being gay, we're just confused and weirded out that you feel the need to keep piloting the conversation towards  sex. By no means limited to gay people, it's just as annoying and cringey when a straight guy/girl won't stop saying unnecessarily sexual shit with no appropriate context, like they've got something to prove that nobody else is all that interested in. I guess it's just happened with gay people more than straight people in my experience so that's what came to mind.

The very existance of the Libertarian party, and the fact it had the success it did in the last election, shows that neither major party offers anything of merit to the Libertarians. ",0.5455032119914347
