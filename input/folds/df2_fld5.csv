"Wikipedia articles cite percentages between 3.5 and 15% whereas the former is often considered too conservative so I'd say you have a point OP. 

However I urge you to consider the motive behind incarceration as it occurs in the US and many other countries now. As I see it there are 4 main motives:

1) Punishment

2) Rehabilitation

3) Deterrent

4) Protection of ""normal"" citizens.

I would argue that if you look at the outcome (high sentences, strong chance of actually getting worse in prison, sexual violence, overcrowding, etc.) you would conclude the obvious motive almost entirely number 4. If you rehabilitate in jail that's great and I suppose you'll be supported, but its clearly not the main driving force.

The fact is that 80% of millionaires in America are first generation millionaires. Despite what many people say we have a ton of class/wage mobility in this country.

there is not a lot of crossover.  there is a small subset of women who want men significantly taller than they are.  if they are able to get it, it's because they bring something extra to the table themselves (out of your league).  if they can't, they'll eventually have to settle.

I get that your job would be a lot easier if your atheists would just believe and defend the simple argument that you want to have, but (for the most part) they just don't.

Atheists lack a belief in God. That is all. If you want to refute that belief, the onus is on you to prove that there is a God.

"> 1)Prostitutes would be significantly less likely to marry and have kids and having kids is important for our society. Low birth rates and unstable marriages are bad for our society. Most men would not marry prostitutes.

By that rationale, we should also outlaw bars and alcohol because they also facilitate extra-marital sex.  How about also setting a curfew and a bed-time for everyone in America and getting rid of all the filth in music and on television?

It is not the business of the governments to try to outlaw things that don't facilitate marriage.  American adults get to choose what kind of sex life they wish to have with other wiling adults.  No one wants a church-government.

"My main concern would be that in some situations, the family could possibly groom a child towards incestuous relationships. If a parent conditions a child to believe that the parent is their future lover, is that healthy? Or that a child should be with their sibling. While you could outlaw this practise, it seems like something that'd be difficult to get at, and I'd rather have the incest banned in general than risk such situations from happening. 

That said, there's always prosecutorial discretion. If it seems obvious that two siblings have had sex and there's been no grooming or anything like that, a prosecutor could just choose not to press charges. A bit like how jaywalking is technically a crime in many places, but people are never charged with it unless they actually do something dangerous. ",0.6766595289079229

"""science"" is an idea and a process, nobody claims that science is a physically existing entity. Science does not exist, it happens.

As for God, your own definition is: ""I define God as the greatest conceivable being.""

The idea of ""greatness"" is ontologically meaningless, unless you mean sheer size. The same goes for other attributes of god: Most good, the ultimate truth, the ultimate prefection, the all-knowing being etc.

These qualities are purely subjective and do not make sense in objective reality outside human perception.

So, the question is: ""does the Greatest Conceivable Being exists?"" and the answer is obviously: no, because that question is nonsensical.

But there is a huge difference between letting someone in power decide which opinion you can and which opinions you cannot publish, and punishing publishing what is objectively false information.
