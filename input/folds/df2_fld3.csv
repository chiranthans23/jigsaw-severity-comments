This sentiment supports the concept of your sex/gender being based on your external physical attributes. It ignores that your brain is very much a physical component of your body, and it's there in the brain that people are Male or Female or SomethingElse.

There is no ""becoming a woman"" or ""becoming a man"". There are only techniques people use to make their outward appearance align with their internal sense of self so they don't feel a jarring reaction every time someone says they are something they are not.

I would strongly encourage you to educate yourself more on this issue, because you'll draw a lot of false conclusions if you don't understand the nature of how sex/gender really behaves scientifically as well as socially/culturally.

Spanking a kid doesn't tell a kid *why* not to engage in a behavior; it only teaches them to fear the consequences of the behavior, which might temporarily fix the problem, but if a parent takes the effort to make it clear to the kid why the behavior is wrong, model correct behavior, reward for good behavior, and discipline them properly only if it continues, then that will correct it in their head.

While you could outlaw this practise, it seems like something that'd be difficult to get at, and I'd rather have the incest banned in general than risk such situations from happening. 

That said, there's always prosecutorial discretion. If it seems obvious that two siblings have had sex and there's been no grooming or anything like that, a prosecutor could just choose not to press charges.

Bryce also clearly favors the publicized player salaries, but is approaching it from a practical/experienced look. The salary information is only a drop in the bucket of information that players really need to properly evaluate themselves.

Marty seems staunchly against the release of player salaries because he sees them as too skewed, non-contextual, and inflammatory for the value they might provide to the players who need the information.

Noise cancellation is different and does well with these low notes since they're predictable. I'd say it's still enough. I've used them on a plane and the noise that did leak through was tolerable. Having to pop my ears was more annoying.

Noise isolation is passively blocking sound while cancellation plays an inverse sound wave compared to the outside noise it picks up with its mic. The two waves cancel each other.

"It took a long time but I finally learned at age 19 or 20: **women love veiny arms**

I don't mean skinny arms with spider-veins, but muscles on forearms with the one or two enlarged veins up the length. It gets women rock hard. I've been working in manufacturing for several years and I'm getting to the muscle structure of a 26 year-old going on 35, because I work with heavy materials and tools 6 days of the week. I've noticed lately, that when I wear muscle shirts or just roll up my sleeves, I catch the eyes of one of my female co-workers and it gives me a huge confidence boost.

One day, I asked one of them about it and she confirmed: women really love the prominent vein on a man's forearm. There's even a subreddit for it.",0.5101713062098501

"This entire concept of the Republican Party having adopted Libertarians always bugged me. Socially speaking, Republicans have always been adamant on their conservative social values. The social platform of the Libertarians is much closer to Liberalism than Conservatism.

"First, how do you define advancement of religion? Arguable every church could be accused of advancing religion by continuously practicing, spreading the word, adding new members, etc. Would a church lose tax-exempt status for putting up a billboard? What about a radio ad? A website?

That's so distasteful and superficial.""

Cultural appropriation is like that, but much stronger because it is not about taste but more commonly about symbols that speak to your very identity. So that distastefulness is amplified and can become almost like an insult for some people because it contributes to banalize something you hold dear.
