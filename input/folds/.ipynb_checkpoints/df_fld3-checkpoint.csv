Thank you again. Im very much aware of and believe in verification and  citations are extremely essential for a project such as this one. The thing is, when it comes to highly contentious issues like a BLP or a historic/ethnic/political article, at least a minority here use the WP:RS/better source tags and violate the WP:NPOV. Minuscule incidents/components are heavily manipulated and the whole picture is painted in a different color.

Everyone uses the word 'evolution' in a different way. I don't believe in 'correct' definitions so much as consistent and useful ones. I propose we adopt the following: 
Evolution: Umbrella term, any change over time, as stated in first sentence of article. 
Natural selection, horizontal gene transfer, etc...  Mechanisms which explain evolution, the observation. 
Theories of evolution: A theory to explain one particular facet of evolution in terms of natural history (e.g. Out of Africa Theory, Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event)
The other problem with this article is that many scientists were motivated by a desire to explain why livings things are adapted to their environment or to explain the diversity of life. As opposed to Evolution per se

This group advocates the continued domination in Ukraine of the minority Russian-speaking citizens through the extension of Russian language and culture; and extension of the authority of the Russian Orthodox Churchin Ukraine, over the Ukrainian Orthodox and Uniate Catholic and Baptist churches. The organization represents the re-estabslishment in Ukraine of The Black Hundreds (sometimes The Black Hundred), also known as the black-hundredists (Чёрная сотня, черносотенцы in Russian, or Chornaya sotnya, chernosotentsy). THese were imperialist ultra-Russian nationalist groups in the Russia empire in the early 20th century. The Bolsheviks labelled these extremists """"great power chauvinists.""""

I agree with your last statement totally! I grew up partically outside of the US in a non-white commonwealth nation, and realize how bad that myopic view many Americans have is. I assign most of the blame to the current US media obsession with targeting the lowest-common denominator of intelligence in entertainment and news programming. I haven't wathced Amercin network news programs intentionally in over 20 years, as they spend 22 minutes on expanded """"personal"""" stories, with litte har """"American"""" news coverage, much less anything else from the rest of the world! I grew up where you could turn on the radio at 3pm, and listen to an hour of BBC World Radio news coverage - now THAT was comprehensive. Don't know if they're still that way or not. Also, US government-run schools are atrocious, and spend little time on world events outside of America's di
direct interaction, and currently most of that is in a purely negative light. So not only do they no nothing of the rest of the world, they think all the rest of the world's problems are our fault!

"""
The figure used on this page isn't the number of people who self-identify as """"Black"""", it's the estimated number of people with some degree of African ancestry... in Latin America in general and Venezuela in particular these are very different things - """"black"""" only applies to people who have sole or predominately African ancestry, while people of mixed ancestry generally consider themselves """"Brown"""" (""""Moreno"""") on the census (presumably this is what you are calling """"mestizo""""). If we simply used the """"Black"""" figure from the census we'd be ignoring the large number of people who have mixed African and European/Native American ancestry. We can't use the """"Brown"""" figure either, as this would include many people who have both European and Native American ancestry but no African ancestry. So the census figures are no good for us and we need to find a different source that estimates African ancestry directly without using the """"black""""/""""brown"""" colour labels. The 20-30% estimation comes from an official document from the Venezuelan government (the Embassy in the US) which specifically states this as the number of people with African ancestry, so is a reliable source for our purposes. If you have an equal or better reliable source that gives an alternative figure then please let me know what it is. 
The 100% issue is a red herring - """"mestizo"""" and """"African ancestry"""" are overlapping categories and can't be added together as if they were distinct... """"mestizo"""" in Venezuela means a mixture of European, Native American and/or African ancestry, so some of the people included in """"mestizo"""" are also included in """"African ancestry"""" and you'd be counting them twice if you added the two together. A better check is that we'd expect """"Afican ancestry"""" to be all of the """"Black"""" category plus part of the """"Brown"""" category, so more than 3% and less than 53% - the 20-30% estimate fits this perfectly.

First of all, I was only pointing out that your use of the term soldier was incorrect, and that it can lead to a general acceptance of the SS as legitmate soldiers, an already dangerously common view.  I was not """"jumping all over you"""" by providing a technical insight which is significant.  And additionally, I never in any way called all rapes supposed crimes; I simply pointed out that German women who viewed themselves as liberated from Nazism or war lived under a regime which would have deported them to concentration camps for having any sexual involvement with anyone considered untermenchlich, could have decided to reward or celebrate with the liberators and then obviously for their own protection claimed that they were raped when Nazis came asking about it.  Additionally, they could have been Nazis, or related to Nazis, and would not have been able to confess Russophilia. Do you realize that I am a racially German girl living in the United States?  The level of emotion in your personal attack demonstrates a level of fanatism that is very strange.  I also never addressed and therefore never condemned you suggestion that women should have a voice.  If that is something that you want, than it is on you to persue it; we are busy with our own research and cannot do yours for you.  However, I will warn you that you should be very cautious about believing anything written by German women, as they may likely be Nazis, and will have a very biased approach to recording the mass rape by the Russians, and would likely outright exaggerate it; many Nazi women openly admit to Western historians that they greatly exaggerated the rape of the Red Army for pro Nazi and anti Communist causes for Gobbels.

 Since I won't be around to implement this - do with it as you will. 

I have written up, what I think would be a working compromiseand was going to post it on Mcshithead's talk page but since he has been such an asshole and will never collaborate with another view... trouble is he runs the place and is so afraid of me he is shitting his pants with every word I write...LOL, and you have had your pee-pee slapped because McGod is afraid of you too.

Anyway here goes.

 Compromise. I can understand almost all the views of most people's concerns, here. As a compromise, to most, I would like to offer a possible solution to address most of those concerns for this otherwise conundrum:
 Extend Andreasegde's Triangular Diplomacy II solution from 2011! Before  anybody freaks-out, please read the rest. This solution  would continue to promote the usage of pronoun references to band names, mid-sentence while still retaining the ability to occasionally use the band's name or individual member references, mid-sentence. Complaints about the usage of all pronouns making boring, repetitive, prose in the article would be addressed by  adding this addendum to the previous Triangular Diplomacy II solution, already observed by many.
 Mid-sentence usage of  both, """"The Beatles"""" and """"the Beatles"""" be permitted, occasionally with these caveats:
Provided an identifying phrase is used to indicate usage, 
 When referring to band members,  a lowercase """"t"""" should be used ie. """"the Beatles"""",
 when referring to the band, as a corporate whole,  an uppercase """"T"""" should be used. ie. """"The Beatles"""".

 Some Examples:
 """"The Beatles were a rock band of great accomplishment."""" = capitalisation is always used at the beginning of a sentence, regardless.
 """"Paul became a Beatle"""" = obvious individual (non-group) reference, no """"the"""" or identifying phrase needed.
 """"Paul became one of the most popular members of The Beatles band"""" = whole group reference with """"band"""" identifier and also obvious context.
 """"Paul became one of most long-lived members of The Beatles band"""" = group reference with """"band"""" identifier and obvious context.
 """"George Martin became involved with The Beatles group later."""" = """"group"""" clarifies corporate group usage meaning.
 """"After the event the individual Beatles went separate  ways"""" = """"individual"""" clarifies individual member context.
 """"After the event the Beatles individuals went separate  ways"""" = """"individuals"""" clarifies.
 """"After the event The Beatles members went separate  ways"""" = members clarifies the band/group. (a gotcha').
 If people have other extreme examples, perhaps we can see them in order to fine tune and clarify to satisfy almost all collaborative editors.
This solution could resolve most of the concerns stated in this medcom proceding. Future editing from newer editors may violate these seemingly complicated rules but would be easy to fix with addition of either simple words or cap correction and a references to some posted (MOS?) rules. The only arguments (I can see) that may arise would be whether the band or the individual members are being referred to. The simple fix, for these disputes, would be to return that particular sentence back to the Triangular Diplomacy solution. This would appear to be inline with hundreds of other musical articles already observing a similar de facto standard. Any violations would be easy to correct and violations would not look outside of most grammar usage anyway. I don't really see any other way to satify so many different concepts, here. Trademarks don't work and the MOS contradicts itself and grammar in many places.
If this solution is even remotely desired by the majority, and/or medcom team, here, this could be fine tuned by controlled input to medcom  mediators. Also implementation methods for clarifying to newcomers would need input on how to set up the MoS page, possibly. Beyond my knowledges. This MoS should apply to all musical articles, if we can make it work.

Penis envy
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump to: navigation, search
For the Crass album, see Penis Envy (album). For the Virgin 1 documentary, see ....Envy.

Penis envy in Freudian psychoanalysis refers to the theorized reaction of a girl during her psychosexual development to the realization that she does not have a penis. Freud considered this realization a defining moment in the development of gender and sexual identity for women. According to Freud, the parallel reaction in boys to the realization that girls do not have a penis is castration anxiety.

In contemporary culture, the term is sometimes used symbolically or metaphorically to refer to the idea that women wish they had a penis, or to refer to anxieties between men about the size of their genitals.

[edit] Freud's Theory

Sigmund Freud introduced the concept of a little girl's interest in—and envy of— the penis in his 1908 article """"On the Sexual Theories of Children,"""" but did not fully develop the idea until substantially later in 1914 when his work On Narcissism was published. It was not mentioned in the first edition of Freud's earlier Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex (1905).

The term came to significance as Freud gradually refined his views of female sexuality, coming to describe a mental process he believed occurred in girls as they passed through the Electra complex from the phallic stage to the latency stage (see Psychosexual development).

In Freud’s psychosexual development theory, the phallic stage (approximately between the ages of 3.5 and 6) is the first period of development in which the libidinal focus is primarily on the genital area. Prior to this stage, the libido (broadly defined by Freud as the primary motivating energy force within the mind) focuses on other physiological areas. For instance, in the oral stage, in the first 12 to 18 months of life, libidinal needs concentrate on the desire to eat, sleep, suck and bite. The theory suggests that the penis becomes the organ of principal interest to both sexes in the phallic stage. This becomes the catalyst for a series of pivotal events in psychosexual development. These events—known as the Oedipus complex for boys and the Electra complex for girls—result in significantly different outcomes for each gender because of differences in anatomy.

For girls:

    * Soon after the libidinal shift to the penis, the child develops her first sexual impulses towards her mother.
    * The girl realizes that she is not physically equipped to have a heterosexual relationship with her mother, since she does not have a penis.
    * She desires a penis, and the power that it represents. This is described as penis envy. She sees the solution as obtaining her father’s penis.
    * She develops a sexual desire for her father.
    * The girl blames her mother for her apparent castration (what she sees as punishment by the mother for being attracted to the father) assisting a shift in the focus of her sexual impulses from her mother to her father.
    * Sexual desire for her father leads to the desire to replace and eliminate her mother.
    * The girl identifies with her mother so that she might learn to mimic her, and thus replace her.
    * The child anticipates that both aforementioned desires will incur punishment (by the principle of lex talionis)
    * The girl employs the defence mechanism of displacement to shift the object of her sexual desires from her father to men in general.

The offshoot of these events, often cited in the media and colloquially, is that a girl really wants to become her mother, so that she can control her father.

A similar process occurs in boys of the same age as they pass through the phallic stage of development. The key differences being that the focus of sexual impulses need not switch from mother to father, and that the fear of castration (castration anxiety) remains. The boy desires his mother, and identifies with his father, whom he sees as having the object of his sexual impulses. Furthermore, the boy’s father, being the powerful aggressor of the family unit, is sufficiently menacing that the boy employs the defense mechanism of displacement to shift the object of his sexual desires from his mother to women in general.

Freud thought this series of events occurred prior to the development of a wider sense of sexual identity, and was required for an individual to continue to enter into his or her gen",0.14285714285714285

As such, it's likely your report to AIV is only going to ensure their names don't get picked up and the systems/attitudes/culture that cause this obviously counter-productive reaction don't get fixed - meaning that Werieth might as well try his arm at another return later. It speaks volumes that you'd think reverting me was remotely a good thing, even though in that very same ANI there's an arb explaining how he could have probably picked up on this whole thing much earlier if it wasn't for just that sort of mindless cycle of reversion and blocking of obvious socks, on the basis all socking is ebil.

 Negative real interest rates on US public debt 

Regarding , , , and  why do you think those edits were """"cut/paste of blog referenced original research""""? They are in no way cut/pastes of even a few words, and they conform to the many sources being discussed at Talk:United States public debt#Negative real interest rates including Lawrence Summers writing for Reuters. This is a very important aspect of the US debt, which you can see by that talk page discussion, and it deserves to be included.

 is particularly confusing because you also undid several formatting changes to conform to the manual of style and the addition of graph illustrations from government sources.  If there is something which made you think that the edits were cut/paste or OR, I'm sorry, but they aren't.

Thank you for that response, and I will benefit from the additional information. I do however believe the entire reporting process is better served if this unintentional obstruction is corrected.

Honestly, I would expect an admin to rather zealously ensure, that they weren't taken out of the loop, by the flaw of an automated process. I believe the timestamp should be compared, and if the report is after the block in place, the report should stay. Manually remove if without action, or when the block is modified, the Bot would remove it then. Unless it was a technical challenge beyond what I can fathom, I see little reason not to.

"""

There are three things to point out about this discussion:
1. The """"material"""" concept of time. Time here is not intended as an abstract entity, a chronological coordinate, as we are used to.  A """"time"""" is the complex of all existing beings, things, circumstances and processes occurring in a particular historical instant. So it 's like an enormous set including everything existing or going on at that moment. If you consider the next instant, another enormous set is determined and that 's different form the previous one, as many things or situations have been changed. So we are included in the times because we are among the countless things and beings """"contained"""" in the flowing times.

2. Sorry Memoro, but I must notice that your feeling of a possible deponent behaviour of the verb """"muto"""" is baseless and factually incorrect.
Indeed, consulting several Latin grammars and dictionaries I found no trace, no hint of a use of """"muto"""" as a deponent or semi-deponent verb, at least in the classics. Simply, when a verb is provided with both forms, active and passive, it cannot be a deponent.
It is however true that """"mutare"""", as well as """"to change"""" in English, may have a transitive or intransitive meaning. When it is transitive there is someone who performs changing and someone who undergoes it; so we can use the active or passive form to determine who 's the agent. We can say  """"I change you"""" or """"I am changed by you"""", leaving no doubt on who 's the author and who the object of changing. In the second case (the passive one) it 's wholly evident that change is not due to my will.
With the intransitive meaning instead, the concept of voluntariness of change remains more shaded and vague. When I say: """"I change"""", I make quite clear that some changing is affecting myself, but nothing is said about whether this change is due to my will or to the events, circumstances or somebody else 's will. Thus, using the active form with intransitive meaning, we can leave an open door to both possibilities:  - a. I am changing because I actually want to, or - b. I am forced to change by circumstances or others.
Therefore, whoever was the author of this maxim, he had a simple way to let us think that we might be the artificers of our own change. He only had to write the verb in its active form: """"mutamus"""". A simple """"s"""" instead of an """"r"""". That wouldn 't even afffect the hexameter 's rhythm. But he (purposedly in my opinion) chose the passive form; so expressly underlining our """"passivity to the change"""".
Moreover, he used a special trick to give an even stronger emphasis to the passivity. Normally speaking in Latin, one would say """"et nos mutamur""""; but here we see """"nos et mutamur"""". Exchanging the pronoun with the conjunction is a rare expedient to emphasize the latter (in Latin language, everything that comes """"after"""" has higher importance in a sentence 's  context). This special exchange serves to point out that this """"nos et"""" is not a simple """"et nos""""; we should translate it as """"and we too""""; but other stronger translations could be: """"and we forcedly"""", """"and we ineluctably"""", """"and we a fortiori"""". 
All this drives me to the conclusion that the sentence 's author wanted to stress as much strongly as possible that we are """"passive"""" poor things in front of the general changing going on through the entire universe. So the true extensive meaning of the phrase is:
""""When everything existing in the universe is subject to change by circumstances and force majeure; how could we, poor little human things, pretend not being changed as well?""""
This way of reasoning comes quite natural if you """"think in Latin"""".

3. According to the ancient and medieval way of thinking, this sentence is nothing else than an Aristotelian categorical syllogism; i.e. the basic unit of logical reasoning.
Here we have:
- a major premise: """"Tempora mutantur""""
- a minor premise: """"in illis"""" saying that we humans are included in times 
- a conclusion: """"nos et mutamur"""".
That simply means we are forced to change because we are part of all things that are changed.
In mathematical logic and set theory, these relations concern set inclusion. So here are: 
a set H containing all humans; a set T containing all times (as defined above) and an even bigger set C containg all things, beings, situations, processes, and complexes af all them, that are subject to changing.
The minor premise states that H is included in T, the major premise says T is included in C and the conclusion is H is included in C.
In other words this is what 's usually defined as """"the transitive property of inclusion"""". Thus, a synthetic translation of our sentence in sheer mathematical terms is:   H ⊂ T, T ⊂ C   ⇒  H ⊂ C""",0.0

"Responding to the bit mentioning a turbocharger probably severed of separate listings, the same reason why I separated the lot from my edits. After reading this section two years ago (ETCC details and Volvo's tricks of the trade) lus your edits on that page was why I ended up broken some of these bits off.

I will accept the Corolla bit as I only suggested because there is a separate page for the AE86, which the info for the AE85 is bundled into.

My reason for separating the XR4Ti is, although there is a Sierra XR4i (2.8 litre), but there is no Sierra XR4Ti (turbo 2.3 litre) as it is simply a rebadged US market Merkur XR4Ti, that is what Andy Rouse said in an interview for the January 2008 issue of evo (page 101), plus he said that they were used to develop the Sierra Cosworth. Also there is an article for it, so that is why I split it off.

Replying to The BMWs were split because there is no such road car as an E36 so how do you list the BMW 318i & 320i. There is, it an article called BMW 3 Series, BMW downsized the 320 to its 318 because BMW said back in '94 believed that the latter is more rev happier.

 As for Supras, this is like saying that the FT0 should be put in the same listing as the Galant FT0 and the recent GT-R should be put in the same listing as the Skyline GT-R. They were simply nameplates that ended up being separated off from its usual range, plus the Celica Supra was a top range Celica as it was based on the same chassis and used the same bodyshell.

Just to point out that I am not a big expert on The Great Race but a fan of the track and the race, so I am not going to know every car that entered the race, hence I don't plan to take the split any further as I have as done much as I can.",0.0

Unless you have newer statistics, those still apply and are valid, unless there is some scientific timelimit I'm not aware of, when something becomes irrelevant? Is it 5 years, or 10, 15...? You can always neutralize the sentence by adding """"according to the 1985 survey...""""

The original (current) sentence lacks neutrality and is giving all the weight on the side of American anthropologists, this even though every single source explicitly says there is no consensus. The neutrality issue will be solved once both opinions are expressed. I did my best and wrote two (what I believe) are neutral texts to replace the current one, but you disagree with both of them.

 More specific disambiguation 

After much thought and research, at present, and taking into account the following condition, I feel that Priyanath is correct in making the Lahiri Mahasaya lineage the main article related to that term, and other articles should be disambiguated. The only condition is if """"kriya yoga"""" pages which directly relate to Mahavatar Babaji and the kriya technique revived by Mahavatar Babaji, are further disambiguated from other usages of kriya. I have now implemented this disambiguation.  Under these specific circumstances, I feel that the Lahiri Mahasaya-related usage of Mahavatar Babaji's Kriya Yoga should remain as the main article.

 Copyright violations 

Lightbringer, if you restore these copyright violations again, I will block you.   

Freemasonrywatch.ORG is quite clearly NOT a commercial content provider, but a personal webpage/blog, therefore your justification is completely bogus. In fact because you knowingly provided a false justification for deletion merits you being removed from being a Wikipedia Arbitrator, in addition to the previous complaint I made against you about your anti-catholic hate filled username. 

 The Epopt provides this explanation for the meaning of
 hisuserame: -Mason Boyne, Presbyterian bigot and Orange
 Lodgemember, says to his wife, “Did you know, Morag, that
 if you spell ‘Pope’ backwards you get ‘Epop,’ which is a
 four-letter word beginning with ‘E’ like ‘Evil’? You see,
 it's all there in the Bible if you just shoogle the letters
 around a bit.”

The fact that you continue to harrass and interject yourself in a complaint and arbitration between pro-occult and anti-occult editors shows your complete disregard for Wikipedia guidelines, and is further proof you should be permanently revoked from being a Wikipedia Arbitrator.   

 

 

 Letters on the Masonic Institution 

By President John Quincy Adams 

Originally Published: 
1847 T. R. Marvin 
BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS 

PREFACE 

IT is now twenty years since there sprung up in the United States an earnest and at times a vehement discussion, of the nature and effect of the bond entered into by those citizens who join the society of Free and Accepted Masons. The excitement which arose in consequence of the disclosures then made, had the effect, at least for a time, if not permanently, to check the farther spread of that association. The legislative power of some of the States was invoked, and at last actually interposed, to prevent the administration of extra-judicial oaths, including of course all such as were constantly taken in the Masonic Order. This was the furthest point which the opposition ever reached. It did not succeed in procuring the dissolution of the organization of the Order, or even the repeal of the charters under which it had a recognized existence in the social system. From the moment of the adoption of a penal law, deemed strong enough to meet the most serious of the evils complained of, the apprehension of further danger from Masonry began to subside. At this day, the subject has ceased to be talked of. The attention of men has been gradually diverted to other things, until at last it may be said, that few persons are aware of the fact, provided it be not especially forced upon their notice, that not only Freemasonry continues to exist, but also that other associations partaking of its secret nature, if not of its unjustifiable obligations, not merely live, but greatly flourish in the midst of them. 

Fully aware of this state of things, a few private citizens who deeply interested themselves in the investigation of the subject when first agitated, yet feel as if their duty was not entirely performed so long as they shall have left undone any act which in their estimation may have the effect of keeping up among their countrymen a vigilant observation of the nature and tendency of secret associations. Without cherishing the remotest desire, even if they could be supposed to entertain the expectation, of reviving an old excitement, they are nevertheless most anxious to put in a permanently accessible shape, some clear and strong exposition of the evil attending similar ties, as that evil was illustrated years ago in an examination of the Freemason's Oath. Such an exposition they knew could be found in the writings of the Honorable John Quincy Adams. But although the various papers in which it was first issued to the public enjoyed an extensive circulation at the period when it was written, and without doubt contributed much to the establishment of an improved state of popular opinion, they are believed never to have been collected together in any one form readily open to the public examination. This great deficiency, it seemed to the gentlemen who have been already alluded to, a desirable object to supply. They accordingly undertook the task of publishing the present volume, not as a matter of sale, but solely with the intention of gratuitous distribution. And first of all, they deemed",0.0

 If He Was Terrorist 

Czech President Miloš Zeman has criticized Ukrainian leaders Stepan Bandera (1909-59) and Roman Shukhevych (1907-50), saying he cannot congratulate Ukraine on such national heroes in his response to an open letter by four Ukrainian studies scholars and historians.

Zeman asks them at the beginning of his letter whether they know Bandera’s statement “Kill every Pole between 16 and 60 years” and whether they agree with it.
If you have not heard these words by Bandera, you are not ukrainists. And if you know about that statement, then do you agree with him or not? If you agree, then our debate is over"""" - wrote Zeman. He continues saying Bandera wanted to establish a vassal German state in the Ukraine.   http://www.praguepost.com/world-news/43706-zeman-criticizes-historical-ukrainian-leaders 

That cannibalistic statement alone brings Badera into the 1st rank terrorists with plans of henocide (a crime agains humanity), let alone many terrorist actions under his command, for example in Poland. As nobody denies these facts, the Article must be on his terrorism only with all other passages having been deleted as unimportant. Въ 95.220.87.246  """,0.0

The article reads more like a left leaning op ed than an objective encyclopedic article. A good example is this unsourced assertion early in the article:
""""By the early 1990s, the term was adopted by US conservatives as a pejorative term for all manner of attempts to promote multiculturalism and identity politics, particularly, attempts to introduce new terms that sought to leave behind discriminatory baggage attached to older ones, and conversely, to try to make older ones taboo.""""

US conservatives didn't """"adopt"""" the term in the early 90s; it would be more accurate to say that by the early 90s the excesses of """"political correctness"""" became more widely known and many people (not just """"US conservatives"""") began to ridicule it (particularly as manifest in the implemnetation of draconian speech codes on college campuses and the aggressive promotion of increasingly dubious and absurd assertions of what might be construed as """"offensive""""). The term has come to be used in mischevous ways at times by people to ridicule positions they disagree with (an example would be creationsts categorizing the teaching of evolution as """"political correctness""""). 

The article in short seems to reflect the perspective of someone of an """"activist left"""" sensibility that is more interested in addressing popular backlash against political correctness than in objectively describing it. It's really not as complicated as the article makes it out to be. In brief, politically correctness is simply a word for efforts to alter or prohibit innocuous language or other activities that are unreasonably or implausibly asserted to be offensive. Unfortunately efforts to honestly describe it seem to be a magnet for what might be called """"political correctness denialists"""" (the idea that there is no such thing as political correctness; it's all just right wing agitprop etc.).""",0.0

 Copyright issues 

A lot of this article is directly copied from the Iceland website:

as indicated by the fact that there are still asterisks inserted which do not relate to anything within the article, but rather to notes on the original page. Is it possible that Iceland have approved this copy?  

Almost certainly not. If it was, there'd be some WP:OTRS tag on this page or something else saying that it was legit. As it is I've removed it for its blatancy.  

Name change
It's my understanding that the overall name """"Iceland.co.uk"""" was dropped as a result of the dotcom bubble bursting - the suggestion being that associating a company so totally with t'internet around 2001-2 was stock market poison.
Fair use rationale for Image:Iceland Shop Logo.gif

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to insure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.

 Iceland International Stores 

I started out on this search knowing, without question, that there was an Iceland supermarket on the road between Mijas costa and Mijas pueblo in the Costa del sol in Spain. While merely """"knowing"""" isn't good enough, it does permit of a longer search and of asking the company about non-UK/Ireland stores.  This is what I was sent by email upon asking the company directly through its website:

I can confirm that Iceland do have a number of franchises overseas. However, we do  not hold this information for these stores here. Please feel free therefore to visit www.overseas.es for further information.

I have fixed the internet address from the preceding paragraph to . Click the """"Store Locater"""" tab and, eventually 4 stores in Spain (notwithstanding the text disclaimer at the top of the page referring only to stores in Tenerife) will appear on a map of Spain.

"Recent Edits to History section 

Hello . I already posted this as part of my response on my talk page, but figured I would post it here as well. I happen to disagree with some of the information you removed from the history section of the article relating to James A. Garfield. You removed information that described the relationship between Garfield and instructors/ administrators both during and following his tenure at Hiram. I feel this was necessary in order to convey the significant role Garfield played in the early years of the institution, beyond even the time that he actually spent on campus. I have seen several correspondences written by Garfield on White House stationary, mind you, to Burke Hinsdale and other leaders of the College during his tragically brief tenure as U.S. President. Garfield's impact on the institution in its early years was so significant that there was even a movement within the College community back in the early 1900s to rename Hiram to Garfield College in his honor. This is why I feel that, if anything, the information you removed should be expanded upon, not deleted. Perhaps you were not aware of the man's impact when you removed these points.

I reorganized the page, the intro was way too long.  I promise I DID NOT remove or change ANY information, but merely reorganized the format.  I hope no one is offended.   

Consider adding Keith Donohue's The Stolen Child to the literature listing.

What about the tales of the faery replacing infants with elderly and ailing faeries, so that the changeling child soon sickens and dies? This is the version I’ve heard most often and it’s also been posited that this form of the changeling myth was an early explanation for cot death or SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome). 

one wonders why they steal babes, if it doesn't work out anyway?
 13:09, Mar 15, 2004 (UTC)

I guess the reason is that our ancestors considered children born with Down's syndrome to be changelings. In this way changelings were a reality and the possibility of having one's child replaced was something that instilled fear. I know from the rural area in south central Sweden, where I grew up, that there was once a """"changeling"""" in the neighbourhood who lived to an old age.

However, you are lucky:
Q.    Can Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata be distributed to the common people before they have read the Gita and Bhagavatam?

 

A.    Yes, Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata can be distributed along with the Gita even before Bhagavatam according to Shrila Prabhupada’s purport on Cc Adi 8.36. In the first part of the purport he explains that Shrimad-Bhagavatam is difficult to understand for the common man due to four reasons:

 

(1)  It is very elaborate due to it being the commentary on the the highly condensed Vedanta-sutra and it is in Sanskrit which is a very difficult language to understand for the common man thus few men can understand its purport.

(2)   Professional reciters have created the impression that Shrimad-Bhagavatam deals only with Krishna’s rasa-lila and thus presented Krishna as a great woman-hunter.

(3)  Professional reciters have introduced bhagavata-saptaha, or seven-day readings of the Bhagavatam.

 

Then Prabhupada explains that under these circumstances, it is a great aid for the common man to read Shrila Vrindavana dasa Thakura’s Chaitanya-bhagavata, for thus he can actually understand devotional service, Krishna, Lord Chaitanya and Nityananda. Due to misunderstanding Shrimad-Bhagavatam, people are misled regarding the science of Krishna. However, by reading Shrila Vrindavana dasa Thakura’s book one can very easily understand this science.

          

So it is pretty clear that Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata is a great book to introduce to the common people who normally may not have the required intelligence & patience to understand the most elaborate Shrimad-Bhagavatam

        

Also Shrila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura has said said that Chaitanya Bhagavata is more important than Chaitanya-charitamrita for the common man because it is a lila-grantha. Without describing so much about philosophy, it describes the lila of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, and is therefore easy for the common man to follow and understand the philosophy. Even though Sarasvati Thakura himself mostly explained philosophy, he said that philosophy is only for the greatly learned people, and for the common men Chaitanya Bhagavata is more important. So he said, """"Read Chaitanya Bhagavata from time to time."""" If anyone came to him he would ask them if they had read Chaitanya Bhagavata. He often asked people this, including non-devotees. He recommended that for ordinary people, the first Vaishnava literature they read be Chaitanya Bhagavata.

 

Q.Then why did not Shrila Prabhupada explicitly tell us to read this book and distribute it in mass quantities?

 

A.    One immediate answer is because Shrila Prabhupada had not translated the book. Shrila Prabhupada did give great importance to Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu’s pastimes that is proved by the fact that he left the translation of the Bhagavatam in middle to complete Shri Chaitanya-charitamrita. So actually he did’nt have time to translate Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata. Although Prabhupada has said that his books are enough, he did say that reading Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata will be a great aid for the common man, that one should read this book if he has to preach the gospel of Lord Chaitanya, that readers will profit much by going through Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata (SB Intro). So I would say that it is not against the teachings of Prabhupada to introduce this book with the original Bengali verses & translation to the common people.

 

Q.   But the translation is not done by Prabhupada. So how will we know whether it is bona-fide?

 

A.    Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata is full of very simple but very sweet Bengali verses which are very easy to translate into any language if the devotee translator is  little intelligent and has a little knowledge of Bengali (which is very easy to get). There are very few Sanskrit verses in the whole book and some of them are from the Bhagavatam.

Hi Woody. While I agree that what was there needed improvement, I'm not altogether sure that what you have put there solves all the problems.
It said: """"Lord Ashcroft contributed significantly to this amount"""". You replaced that with: """"significantly paid for by Lord Ashcroft"""".
I'm not very sure what """"significantly paid for"""" actually means.
The original implies that Ashcroft didn't pay ALL of the reward. If one removes """"significantly"""" from your change, one is left with """"paid for by Lord Ashcroft"""". That's not the same. I'm not sure what your addition of """"significantly"""" was meant to mean. Further, I'm not sure what the addition of """"significantly"""" actually does mean.
What was wrong with """"Lord Ashcroft contributed significantly to this amount"""" that lead you to change it?
It said: """"New Zealand Police announced all the medals had been recovered as a result of the reward"""". You removed """"as a result of the reward"""". Why?
It said: """"A high profile Auckland lawyer, Chris Comeskey, played a key part in the drawn out negotiations to safely return the medals."""" You removed that sentence. Why?
Several versions ago you reverted it to say: """"While there has been much public debate about the need to offer reward money in order to retrieve the medals, there is universal relief that they have been safely returned"""". Yes, the tenses needed changing, but now it just says: """"There was much public debate about the need to offer reward money in order to retrieve the medals.""""

There are two methods to define the topology of a LCTVS space: using a family of seminorms and using a local basis of locally convex, balanced and absorbend sets. Both methods should be present in the article on equal terms. The family of seminorms is useful to view LCTVS as generalizations of normed vector spaces. The definition in terms of a local base is useful if you are coming from the more abstract topological vector space concept.

The definition section is now too long and detailed. I think the subject is specialized enough so that we can assume the reader is familiar with the basic concepts which are now explained in detail in the definition.

I've cleaned up your draft a lot. If you click """"View history"""" on the page, you can see the various changes that I made. For instance, with this edit I added several wikilinks. With this edit, I created an introductory sentence, so the reader can know instantly who she is and why she is important.
This next edit is very important: in it I changed the references to use  tags, so that individual statements are sourced. Notice how the first time I cite a source, I use the format url.com. When I later want to use the same reference, I only use the format . If you add more statements from these or other sources, you can reference them in the same way.
I made several other changes, which you can view in the history. I'm sure you'll want to add more information from these two references, and maybe from other references as well.

""""And news of the Shaikh reached the emir of al-Ahsa and its dependencies from Bani Khalid, Sulaiman ibn 'Uray;ir al-Khaldi, and it came to his knowledge that he called to God, and that he brought down the domes, and that he instituted the hudud [punishments], and so the matter of the Shaikh disturbed this bedouin, for it is the habit of the bedouin - except those whom God has guided - to rush to commit injustice, bloodshed, expropriation, and violation of prohibitions, so he feared that the power of this Shaikh may increase and do away with the power of the bedouin prince.  And so he wrote to Uthman, threatening him, and ordered him that he must kill this mutawwa that is with him at 'Uyayna, and said: 'this mutawwa that is with you, such and such has come to our knowledge about him!!  Either you kill him, or we cut off the dividend that you have with us', for the emir Uthman had [an annual] dividend of gold in the custody of [al-Khaldi].""""

"Glosbe does translate ezman as “heaven” (******) or “sky” (*****) and it back-translates “heaven” as ezman.

 Some definitions from Merriam-Webster Unabridged:

 Heaven. 1. a. … especially, the expanse [of space] that seems to be over the earth like a great … dome — usually used in plural. 2. a. … the place … of the blessed dead.
 Earth. 1. a.  … soil, ground. 2. the sphere of mortal life comprising the world with its lands and seas as distinguished from spheres of spirit life — compare heaven, hell.
 Sky. 1. b. the expanse [of space] appearing as a great vault … over the earth. 2. heaven (def. 2) — often used in plural.
 Tremble. 1. to shake involuntarily (as with fear, cold, excitement, fatigue).

 These two expressions are good idiomatic English:
 “If his wrath is aroused, the skies will tremble [in fear].”
 “If his wrath is aroused, the heavens will tremble [in fear].”
 Here the singular “sky” and “heaven” would not be used in good spoken English, only in mediocre written English.

 So we have a choice of eight ‘very good’ literal translations:
 “YPG is [goes] walking, and the earth and [the] skies tremble.”
 “YPG is [goes] walking, and the earth and [the] heavens tremble.”

 If you try speaking them aloud, you may find that this one sounds best:
 A. “YPG goes walking, and the earth and heavens tremble.” Something about the meter (the cadence) just makes it sound liks a military motto.

 The present-progressive clause “YPG is walking” would naturally correlate with the present-progressive clause “the earth and skies are trembling.” But we want to use simple present tense in the second clause.  (See above.)

 To do so, a native English speaker would begin with “YPG goes walking …”, because it combines both tenses: simple present and present progressive.

 But see whether you can come up with a better-sounding combination!",0.0

Also look at the """"ignore all evidence"""" question, this occurred to me as I was going along and it must be regarded as a general behavioural question when linked to the """"5 days"""" question, plus this shows it was not a """"spam"""" question to all candidates, I did pay attention to their statements.

This is the question I posed to select candidates.
What general concerns do you think are raised by the 5 days of silence from the community's admins in this ANI? Are there any other general concerns which arise from the ANI?

Do these quotes;

ameliorate, add to or amplify concerns?

Do you agree with the substance of the Jehochman quotes?

Cadfael said Columbanus did not need the poppy syrup on this trip, and Cadfael thought the events of that day cast doubt on Jerome as the murderer, not Columbanus  until his realization that Jerome did not sleep on purpose.  Now Cadfael cast his doubts on Columbanus.  Cast doubts, not provided alibis.  

The brothers have no private property, so he can search the scrip any time.  Peredur's mother is a minor plot device so he does search; the main point is the discovery and Cadfael's new view of that day. 
Perhaps you could provide the text quotes for your changes, next time.

Quotes from the text of A Morbid Taste for Bones

Jerome lacks an alibi, rather than providing one for Columbanus in Chapter Six
""""Father, you sent me with Brother Jerome, yesterday, to keep vigil in the chapel, and pray earnestly for a good outcome, in amity and peace. Father, we came there in good time, before eleven, as I judge, and having eaten our meal, we went in and took our places, for there are prayer-desks within, and the altar is kept clean and well-tended. Oh, Father, my will to keep vigil was good, but the flesh was weak. I had not been half an hour kneeling in prayer, when I fell asleep on my arms on the desk, to my endless shame. It is no excuse that I have slept badly and thought much since we came here. Prayer should fix and purify the mind. I slept, and our cause was weakened. I must have slept all the afternoon, for the next thing I remember is Brother Jerome shaking me by the shoulder and telling me there was a messenger calling us to go with him.""""

He caught his breath, and a frantic tear rolled down his cheek, circling the bold, rounded Norman bone. """"Oh, do not look askance at Brother Jerome, for he surely never knew I had been sleeping, and there is no blame at all to him for not observing and reporting my sin. I awoke as he touched me, and arose and went with him. He thought me as earnest in prayer as he, and knew no wrong.""""
Nobody, probably, had thought of looking askance at Brother Jerome until then, but Cadfael was probably the quickest and most alert, and the only one who caught the curious expression of apprehension, fading rapidly into complacency, that passed over Brother Jerome's normally controlled countenance. Jerome had not been pursuing the same studies as Cadfael, or he would have been far from complacent. For Brother Columbanus in his self-absorbed innocence had just removed all certainty that Jerome had spent the previous noon and afternoon motionless in Saint Winifred's chapel, praying for a happy solution. His only guarantor had been fast asleep throughout. He could have sauntered out and gone anywhere he chose.

Cadfael speaking to Peredur in Chapter Nine
""""Never mind, you can show me where they lodge. Columbanus brought some of my poppy syrup with him, in case of need, the phial should be there with his scrip, he'd hardly have it on him. And as far as I know, he's had no occasion to use it, his cantrips here in Wales have been of a quieter kind. We can find a use for it now.""""

 Attempt at close of old RfC 

That is, the RfC listed on Archive 4 of this talk page, """"RfC: Does the article minimize the centrality of India to the notion of caste?"""" That the discussion wasn't closed earlier is of little surprise: it is long, it is technical, and the older it gets the less appetizing it gets: such discussions are very much not like Parmigiano-Reggiano. In fact, the discussion is so long that you'll have to accept the general conclusions I think I was able to draw without my being able to point at each and every individual comment supporting it. What I, as a non-Hundi-Indian currently middle-class college professor, conclude, are the following points:
Scholarly consensus appears to be that the caste system is still of the greatest importance to Hindu India; vice versa, discussions of the caste system in secondary and tertiary scholarly sources note the centrality of Hindu India to the very concept of """"caste"""".
Scholarly and especially less scholarly discussions on the concept of caste in other societies, esp. those outside SE Asia, mostly seem to use the term in the """"broader"""" sense signaled in various places in the RfCas a convenient shorthand for """"social stratification"""" and such. I note also that the application of the term """"caste"""" to some other cultures, popular until the 1970s and perhaps after, has now come under (academic) scrutiny and criticism.
Considering those two points, I conclude that it is 
The 1 September 2012 version of the article does suffer from OR and some coatracking; the current version is much better in that respect, though far from perfect. Note, for example, the very loose use of the word """"caste"""" in this newspaper article to warrant the inclusion of Cagot. As it turns out, there are sources """"comparing"""" their segregation to that of the Indian caste system: such a comparison is perhaps valid, but does not itself warrant calling them a caste.

Allow me a few observations and suggestions.
""""Caste"""" should (and this is supported in the RfC) include extensive discussion of the situation in India.
Examples from other cultures (some of which well established and verified in the current version of the article and associated main articles) must of course be thoroughly verified; an article from The Independent cannot suffice for what is, after all, an encyclopedic article.
I believe it is imperative (and comments in the RfC and elsewhere in the talk page archives support this) to come to a clarification of terms. The current lead does some of that already, but a separate section is warranted. Etymology should be the least important part of such a section; more important is a history of the usage of the termnot to be able to list every example of its usage, but rather to sketch the attractiveness of the paradigm to scholars of various periods, an attractiveness that has by now lost some of its currency. Parts of the lead of the 1 September 2012 version point to that as well; what's important is to delineate the term and its currency. Fowler&Fowler; cites Balkin in the RfC (""""social stratification in the United States does not really match the technical definition of caste ... caste is at best an effective hyperbole"""") and it's precisely that kind of research and criticism that need to be used here.
Sourcing should continue to be scrutinizedin Caste system in India, I read """"Caste is neither unique to Hindu religion nor to India; caste systems have been observed in other parts of the world, for example, in the Muslim community of Yemen, Christian colonies of Spain, and Japan"""", with one reference possibly very outdated (1972) and another a newspaper article from the New York Times. This is an article in which Wikipedia's crowdsourcing """"hey it's in the paper let's add it"""" needs to be held in check.

In all, I believe this was an interesting discussion in which the participants are perhaps closer to consensus than they thought. It is clear that there is no consensus that the article is redundant to Caste system in India etc.; it's clear also that there is consensus that the article should be much more focused than the 1 September 2012 version was, and that India must occupy a position of great(er) importance. In various places various quantified suggestions were made; I cannot comment on those numbers. I sensed some hesitance at perhaps """"borrowing"""" material from Caste system in Indiawell, if that's where good content on the concept of caste, its history, and its usage can be found, that's where you go.

Narayana Guru and Sahodran Ayyappan

Narayana Guru had disagreed with Sahodaran Ayyappan when the latter tried to corrupt Guru's teachings with Atheism.In fact Ayyappan requested Guru's permission to modify the slogan  'Oru Jati , Oru Matham, Oru Daivam Manushyanu' as 'Jati Venda, Matham Venda, Daivam Venda'. However, Guru ridiculed him by asking """" If Ayyappan wants to collect Rs.1 from each person to set up a library,  you will ask ' Give One Rupee,Give One Rupee,Give One Rupee'. Does that mean ' No Rupee,No Rupee,No Rupee """" ?

This 'Sahodaran' kept quiet at that time.However, he renewed his Atheist activities after the samadhi of Guru, thereby corrupting Guru's ideology. Vested interests fully exploited this confusion to corrupt Guru's teachings by projecting this 'Sahodaran' even above Guru.

Clarification on Atheism

No where in the article did I say that Naryanaguru was an atheist. What I wrote was “his attitude towards the existence of a personal god is considered quite ambivalent” and that many of his followers had considered him an atheist.  Can somebody point out which sentence of the article gives such an impression that he was an atheist?  It goes to the credit of Sri Narayanaguru that in spite of being a theist, he openly accepted even atheists as his core desciples. The importance of this can be guaged only if one consideres the period in which he lived.

One also has to be clear about the kind of thiesm Narayana Guru adovocated. It definitely was not the one associated with the brahaminical/casteist Hiduism.

I find it bit difficult to comprehend why this section on atheism and atheist followers of Narayanaguru should be edited out.  A discussion/debate on the philosophy of Narayanaguru is thoroughly understandable but I find it puzzling that the followers of Narayanaguru are getting overly agitated on hearing the word atheism. Pity indeed! 

And I agree with Aaroamal that there is a distintion between rationalist and atheist. That is precisely why I assert in my user page of wikipedia that I am both an atheist and rationalist.

 Clarification on Atheism 

Manoj, True, you did not explicitly write that Narayana Guru was an atheist. However, you implicitly structured a (misinformed and incomplete) statement as follows:

 “When Sahodaran Ayyappan modified Narayana Guru's famous catchphrase, Oru Jati, Oru Matham, Oru Daivam Manushyanu (One Caste, One Religion, One God for Humanbeing) and re-written it as Jati Venda, Matham Venda, Daivam Venda Manushyanu…the latter did not protest”. 

Obviously by stating that “…the latter did not protest”, here you are clearly implying that Narayana Guru accepted Sahodaran Ayyappan’s atheistic view as amendment to the famous catchphrase. I am sorry to say that this is absolutely false!

Everybody appreciates that Narayana Guru was tolerant of atheists because he respected an individual’s fundamental right and freedom to belief, or disbelief, in the exitence of God. That tolerant attitude however should not be misinterpreted to imply otherwise.

As Krishnan has already pointed out, Narayana Guru’s reaction to Sahodaran Ayyappan’s revised version of the slogan was a clear protest, so it is not true to say …”the latter did not protest”.

Please could you explain what you mean by saying, “his attitude towards the existence of a personal god is considered quite ambivalent”; are you referring to any of Narayana Guru’s writings, if so which one? Which serious scholar of Narayana Guru has so commented? Also, in what context is that statement being included under the heading “Narayana Guru and Atheism”.

"User Kannambadi, please do not try to frighten and justify blocks on me.  Did the person who blocked me on two occasions (first of all I do know, it was you and your other friends who cannot tolerate a counter opinion, who prompted the irresponsible blocking on the previous occasions.... you are again giving a seemingly sage advice for first discussing before carrying out edits.... do you remember what you told the user (I forget his name, but he was from Maharashtra)?  You wrote: I borrow from Kamath, you go and get it from a good library. I have a good library near my home and town, where the book is available. Thus, you left it all on the person countering YOUR opinion to prove otherwise.... Why not do the same thing this time around?  

I have indeed borrowed from two books called Ancient India, one by K.A.N.Sastri and R.C.Roychowdhuri. These are two books of the same name by the above named two authors with Roychowdhuri borrowing extensively from Sastri.  I also think that the book by K.A.N.Sastri is dated 1959 while the one of Roychowdhury is either 1951 or 1961, probably it is 1961 edition.  Roychowdhuri's book is quite different from the edition of the same book available on the internet at books.google.com/.

Please also try preaching the same to the irresponsible user who blocked me in that he should also have practiced what you are preaching me.... that is first indulge in a discussion before taking action to block contributors like me. Did he do that? He simply barged into my page like a bull in the china shop and blindly commented that I have made personal commentary on the Chola page and hence he was blocking me.  This after I had painstakingly borrowed from noted epigraphist Huntzsh's summary of the rule of the Chola empire where he had sought to dispel the notions that they were devout Saivites by saying that during the rule of the second Chola king i.e. Aditya I itself, two temples i.e. the Siva Temple of Chidambaram and the one at Srirangam being a Vishnu temple and regarded the most important Siva and Vishnu temples, were both declared as Kuladhanam (family heritage sites) for the Chola kings (ordaining in a way that the kings of this dynasty one after another will look personally after the upkeep of traditions at both the temples and their well being). Indeed, I made the mistake of not quoting Prof. Huntzsh (again courtesy the site you love to deride calling it a POV website despite using it to support points on Chalukyas and Hoysalas) but on my very next visit on the same day, I found that the 'department of dirty tricks' had prompted Blinguen to block me for the second time. Does Blinguen have any knowledge at all of Indian history, most of all of the history of the Cholas, Hoysalas or Pandiyans and most of all of your beloved Chalukya Cholas?  Certainly I would have loved to engage him on a one to one debate on Indian history especially that of South India.  I also wrote to Taprobanus wanting to prosecute Blinguen and requested for his address.  

It is a shame that cowards contacted him it seems on the email or on phone to complain about me, but no one ever wrote about it in the open, no one contacted me and most of all no one ever wanted to discuss the matter. Rather, people who scarcely contributed to the Chola page like user Earth etc. started advocating this and that.  Mind you, user Earth himself was adviced by another admin when he complained about me that the contributions made by me were in good faith only, but it seems ultimately the dirty gang on wikipedia bent upon converting it into some sort of monkeypedia finally had their say.

What you basically always do is you want to write and not just that, you want whatever you write to be retained at all costs, but in the process, you forget counter opinions by other historians as well.  K.A.N.Sastri has written in his book (as opposed to what you wrote quoting Kamath that Satyasraya defeated crown prince Rajendra), that Rajendra Chola defeated Satyasraya (he wrote something like: next was the turn of Satyasraya who fled the battlefield near the fields of Hottur-??) and hid in the jungles of Kogali and Kadambalige.  I would say 'exactly' for you find among the limited number of inscriptions available of Satyasraya (courtesy: the site you always try to trash inscriptions.whatsindia.com/) which are indeed found at Kogali and Kadambalige and in fact in a couple of these inscriptions Satyasraya even is called as 'ruling from Kadambalige'. Kindly access this information in the same manner as I have done and exactly in the same manner as you expect others to do, i.e. access appropriate information from appropriate sources.   Even in this, I do not want to claim whatever I say is correct, indeed if Satyasraya is attributed by Kamath with victory over Rajendra then kindly also quote other sources where Rajendra claims victory over the Chalukyas including the most important Wo",0.0

"re Greatness 

hello and thank you for your comment.

Einstein and da Vinci, for example, appear twice in the 'greatness' article.   I have only made 8 such links and have another four or five to do.  that is all.  if I were reading the Einstein article, for eg, and came across a link to an article which discusses major social scientific research done on the topic of 'greatness' in which Einstein was considered, I would follow it up with interest.

""": Hi Hanely, and others,

First, a further clarification on the concept behind wikipedia, neutrality is a fundamental pillar, but there are two others as well, no original research and verifiability.  This takes us into the """"weasel words"""" you mention, which it's true is an area where improvements are needed with the article.  A reader should be able to independently check everything written in a wikipedia article should they want to, and as such, wikipedia is more about providing verifiable information rather than what a given editor simply thinks or believes is """"true.""""  You specifically cite the Criticism section, and I agree.  """"Plagiarism"""" has evolved the furthest of the three subsections IMO and is solidly referenced with verifiable sources (I think the believer stance(s) aren't presented as well as they could though), and the same should probably be done for """"Science"""" and """"Revelation"""".  For instance, one thing that can be done for """"Revelation"""" is cite the low book sales and distribution of the TUB instead of the simple current statement that it isn't widespread.  """"Peacock terms"""" have been an ongoing challenge from my perspective, commonly inserted throughout the article in a way that aggrandizes the book, but I think this is currently toned down.

What I'm hearing from you Hanely overall is a suggestion to focus on TUB alone, make the article perhaps a book summary with some history added, and put everything else in other articles.  It is one way to go, and you specifically mention Criticism-related topics as being placed elsewhere.  This would also need to be true of the adherents section and anything """"pro"""".  I don't agree with this tactic however, for reasons of wikipedia policy and overall usefulness to the average reader.  What makes TUB interesting and worth writing & reading about is that it purports to be more than a typical religious book, and people accept it as such.  I think that is a highly intertwined element of the TUB topic, and it fits in this article, and by the same token the reasons people *don't* accept it as such is part of the story.  I think it is a challenge to have the article reflect these differing perspectives, but that's a basic challenge involved with wikipedia articles in a nutshell.  Writing separate articles for separate points of view is discouraged.  See POV forking.

I think there needs to be a top-level article that is a summary of The Urantia Book basics, its teachings, its history, and those who are pro and con on topics related to it.  Other articles can then develop certain topics in more depth, if needed or wanted.  I don't see why the top-level article shouldn't be this one, it already serves as that, and other similar topics on wikipedia are structured the same way (for instance A Course in Miracles isn't a simple book synopsis & some words about the history, but covers pro and con viewpoints, as does Book of Mormon, which also has a plagiarism section).  I certainly do not accept that for some reason everything to do with Criticism should be tucked away in separate articles.  This is inherently biased toward the idea that the main wikipedia article is only for those seeking viewpoints where nothing negative is said.  Audiences also come to learn about contrary viewpoints, and those viewpoints are just as valid.

On the points you brought up, my thoughts:

1.  I've seen a tendency over the 1+ year I've followed this wikipedia article off and on for people to add many digressions to the article.  And understandably so, TUB is enormous and has thousands of interesting details and side stories.  But not all will fit in the main article.  I've seen multiple people each add a few sentences here and there, and over time, the article has become enormous and unfocused with all sorts of illogical disorganized digressions.  Like you say, this article can stand to be streamlined (you should have seen what it's been like before!).  IMO, the Lucifer rebellion story, while interesting, doesn't quite make the cut in terms of being essential enough to mention on the main page.  Perhaps an article summarizing TUB's view of the history of earth is worthwhile to build up?  The Lucifer / Caligastia / Satan story would fit in article such as that, for example.

2.-5.  Like I've said, Criticism is appropriate to have, as is the view of believers, and a POV fork is contrary to wikipedia standards.  In terms of Gardner specifically, despite any opinions on his conclusions about TUB, his book is one of the few published about TUB to analyze it from a nonbeliever perspective and it's entirely appropriate to use and cite as reference material for the article.  I say that even though I'm not personally convinced by arguments he makes.  I've read his book, have access to a copy, and can make edits regarding i",0.0

 GayFest references 

It would be nice if English translations for Romanian news article titles could be provided. Regards.  

Thanks! Tomorrow, I'l probably go and covert them to Cite templates.  

Okay, I converted everything except the Pravda and Nadiafax links, because they were inaccessible. The Journalul title also lacks a translation (I think it's because it was added after I made the above comment), and I commented out the last ref because it seemed to have an improper url or something. It linked to the program for 2006.

Statements like,   are flagrantly inaccurate. Please check my edits honestly before getting swayed by the lies of this user.

 —this user has been stalking me and reverting all my comparatively larger edits without providing enough reason. One example, just because one of my sentences contained one slightest (but I'm not too sure if it was incorrect at all) scientific inaccuracy he rashly reverted the whole edit when he could have enriched the article by simply correcting the inaccuracy with good sources.

I sincerely think he is starting multiple edit wars at once. He thinks just because I don't have many administrator friends he could revert my changes. His primary claim is that none of my sources are reliable but his/her sources are. Just look at his contributions. His contributions are mostly deletions of the edits he doesn't like. Also his activity is mysteriously sporadic. He might as well be a sock (he also claims that whoever supports my position is my sockpuppet).

I have understood that what I did was inappropriate for this site, and confirm that I won't do it again. I was also unaware of the many policies on Wikipedia, of which one was """" legal threat"""". I was however not given any chance to repent despite my many explanations and promises to reform, which were neglected. I was cynically blocked by administrator  who chose to show no consideration for my arguments in combination with his lack of theoretical understanding of the dispute, in effect labeling some valid arguments as """"politically inflamed"""". In addition, he seems to find it reasonable to motivate his totalitarian actions due to editing I may have done 3 years ago, despite any such activity being ruled insignificant by other administrators concerned with supposed sock-puppetry. I am deeply disturbed by the lack of objectiveness by  and call for at least two additional, unrelated, administrators to review the block.

Frankly I am less interested than comparisons between coordination between with the list vs watchlist coordination than opaque coordination (list or watchlist) vs transparent collaboration.  I am just wondering what effects on articles (if any) can be seen.  I know these tactics frustrate editors and hold back the articles by attrition.  And the """"other side"""" are all parties too.  I am not suggesting you only present evidence against EE list members.  Or even that it really be focused on individual editors.  What has the existence of a Battleground done to articles in this topic area, is really what I want to know.  While EE editors have apologized for some personal offenses, I believe that none of them have shown understanding that they harmed Wikipedia.  I am probably wrong about none, but I can't recall this.  I can't say that I have even paid much attention to this at the individual editor level.  Except to be honest I feel a bit differently about the admin. Mostly I want support for the argument that the whole Battleground approach is inferior.  Evidence that shows damage done by all parties for what it is would help because the focus on the revelations from the list while ignoring the other half the battleground reinforces their feelings of persecution.  Right now each side exaggerates the damage done by the other and then there is extra evidence against EE from the list.  If we don't convince them that we have a point about condemning this sort of behavior; I don't know that anything Arbcom can do will make an impact.  Arbcom isn't good at convincing.

 Harrow 2013 
Doc James correctly reverted my removal of text cited to Harrow, noting that it is, in fact, a review although PubMed does not indicate so.  However, IMO the text in the article is too strong for what the source supports.  
conclusions from PMID 23512950, Harrow 2013 Overall, the longitudinal studies cited do not provide conclusive proof of a causal relationship between being off medications and being psychosis free. They do clearly indicate that not all schizophrenia patients need continuous antipsychotics for a prolonged period, providing extensive evidence of samples of medication-free schizophrenia patients with favorable outcomes.6,12,22 Is it at least a moderate-sized number of schizophrenia patients who do well, longitudinally, without medications? This important issue needs longitudinal research for more precise answers. The longitudinal studies indicate the importance of further research on how many schizophrenia patients profit from continuous administration of antipsychotics over a prolonged period, what factors identify and separate schizophrenia patients who do not need prolonged antipsychotic treatment, and whether or not prolonged use of antipsychotics is harmful for some or many patients.

The above-cited longitudinal results from many different countries and different types of schizophrenia patients provide data bearing on issues about long-term treatment. Discussions by Whitaker, Moncrieff, and others question long-term antipsychotic treatment.25–27 These disparate views, research by WHO and DOSMED in developing countries,12 and our own longitudinal studies5–7 should be considered as prompts for further long-term outcome research on this important issue.

"""::::::: Hi everyone this is the first time I've closely examined this page. I've been heavily involved in OWS since last October, which means two things: 1) I know a bunch of stuff first-hand, including things the media has failed to document, and 2) sometimes an NPOV is going to be difficult for me to maintain. That said, I have many concerns with this article, mostly on the facts. For example, this quote above: the rules of Zuccotti Park aren't self-justifying; this quote and others in the article seem to indicate that they are actually material. They're not; they don't actually exist; there is a rule-making procedure that is required by city law which the police and Brookfield have totally ignored. So, using them to explain police action without quoting or citing a police source is not NPOV. Secondly, these rules have nothing to do with the police tactics used that day, which were employed all over the Financial District, well outside the region where the """"rules"""" of Zuccotti Park apply. What happened was the police grab whoever they feel like at any given moment, apply laws like the disorderly conduct statute willy-nilly (""""blocking pedestrian traffic"""" is frequently absurdly applied), and have a goal not of enforcing laws but of maintaining an extralegal standard of order. This is called """"crowd control policing"""", and it explicitly involves unconstitutional conduct and arrests. Remember, sometimes a point of view is political despite being neutral, i.e. based in empirical observation and fact. Thanks for your work, and perhaps you can offer some guidance as to how first-person expertise can properly be used to make sure a wiki article is factual and not based on flawed or incomplete media interpretation.

Hi - I see you have recently created one or more new stub types. As it states at Wikipedia:Stub, at the top of most stub categories, and in many other places on Wikipedia, it is recommended that new stub types are proposed prior to creation at Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting/Proposals, in order to check whether the new stub type is already covered by existing stub types, whether it is named according to stub naming guidelines, whether it is otherwise correctly formatted, whether it reaches the standard threshold for creation of a new stub type, and whether it crosses existing stub type hierarchies.

 Hi thanks for taking the time to respond Avi.  I had presumed you were Muslim because it said on your talkpage that you had contributed to the Abbey Hill Mosque article.  From your response I now gather you are of the Jewish faith so sorry if I have misrepresented you at any point. Have I got that right, you are Jewish, not Muslim? I also presumed you were from the UK (which is where I am from) because you had contributed to an article on a UK mosque.  Is that right?
When I said most people are against it I meant that most people where I am from don't know much about it and if they did find out about the negative aspects of it (such as the complications (serious and minor), loss in sexual function, etc) then they would most likely take a somewhat negative view of it. I would apply this to all non-circumcising cultures.  These people may not campaign against it or join the genital integrity movement (if you could describe it as such), however they would in general have a negative view of it.  There are a few reasons as to why I think they'd view it somewhat negatively once you forced them to give their view on it. 
It is done on children without their consent.  Most people would view this as ethically wrong - to not have any say in a major alteration to a part of your body (a particularly sensitive part at that).  
It can cause pain (people generally don't like to see children in pain).  
They then might ask if there was a reason for it to be done.  They would look at the views of the medical associations (via their policy statements on RIC) and find out that it isn't a net positive operation, therefore it doesn't need to be done for health reasons.  Furthermore, those that are not circumcised would realise it is a needless operation because they had done fine being intact.
 What I am saying is that most people do view it negatively (if they know about it and are forced to choose), they just don't bother saying anything because they do not wish to cause upset to a religious community or be accused of being intolerant.  
 I am not sure what bizarre forced circumcision you are referring to.
 Regarding the term/title of the article, I don't see how calling the article Male circumcision would equate it with female circumcision.  I realise they are different operations, but they still involve cutting of the genitals.  You also cannot deny that a lot of people refer to FGM (as you would call it) as female circumcision.  Furthermore, a lot of people, when asked to define """"circumcision"""" would ask the question, """"which type? Male or female?"""" In the last post on this subject, at talk:circumcision, I said this and I don't think you or Jake responded.  I took that as meaning you didn't have a counter-argument to what I said.  My point there was that we should be as specific as possible and that being accurate is more important than using the most widely used term.  This is following the Wikipedia naming guidelines.

I wanted to be a touch more exact on some of the parts for Mugen’s character. He’s such an interesting character that even though he is almost purely made up out of the minds of the creators, he still has a few bits of actual historical pertinence to him.

The part I’m addressing now is the interesting way in which he comes back to life by meeting the “Shamans” as referred to in his character profile. In the Okinawan belief system, these shamans are called “futuki” and they are the only spirits from the other world who intercede into human affairs.

These beings are generally thought to be an individual's own direct ancestors (both male and female), and the same individual's future descendants (which makes it kind of interesting that Mugen has a center place in the ongoing line of them; maybe there is something to the theory that Spike is his descendant...). Anyway, the futuki are generally masked and wear feathered cloaks, and are indistinguishable from each other, at least in this world. During one of the many interesting flashback montage’s, we see not only the long line of them, but one watching Mugen from the road through the forest, and a couple of other spots, which suggests to me that he's someone they're keeping an eye on. It would make sense by traditional Okinawan beliefs but it is pure speculation on my part.

The feathered apparel particularly have always made me wonder about that tropical looking red bird that seems to observe Mugen so closely in that grove; maybe another spirit observer? And it might also be interesting to note that the underworld where he deals with the futuki, Nirai-kanai, is represented in Okinawan folklore as an island you can only reach by swimming underwater; if you try to sail there it'll always be on the horizon no matter how far you go. I think that's why everything there appears upside down, you have to """"sink to rise"""" there, so to speak; and Mugen """"falls back to the surface"""" when he leaves that place.

The Korean media still uses the word Comfort Women for modern day sex workers serving US military camps. (Antitrafficking Policies in Asia and the Russian Far East: A Comparative Perspective by Schuckman, Emily E).

 * Unless anyone can come up with a name, full references and a citation, the 410,000 should be removed as per Wikipedia policy. (Clue: the reason no one has put their name to it is clear if you read the actual source for it ... no historian dares put their name nor institution on it.). The Youtube mourning song is not according to policy either.

 * Historically, the use of the word for the licensed, voluntary system of prostution came place first and should come first in the topic. When, how and upon what scale the forcible recruitment tooks place is unclear. Its appears to have started as a """"rational"""" response to a major problem and then exaggerated as the war years went on. The article needs to look more accurately at the sequence of event NOT the politicized version of them since. 

 * Can anyone come up with actual figures or proportions of

a) those women that worked voluntarily or because they had no other options
b) those taken forcibly

 How and when did the system change?

 * Missing elements;

 a) the local agents, criminal underworlds and government bureaucracies that became involved, i.e. both Chinese and Korean
 b) the roots or context of the phenomenon, e.g. women in the slave caste of Korea, the system of local agents in Asia buying and selling daughters (it equally existed in Japan as well).
 c) its legacy afterwards in the industrialization of the Korean sex industry after WWII, e.g. the same comfort women working in prostitution for the American occupational forces and the Korean army. To state the obvious, the women and system did not just disappear post-WWII.
 d) The reason and role of General Park Chung Hee's regime, the Korean Censorship Board etc in the suppression discussion of the issue leading to the burial of the issue until it arose again in the 80s and 90s.

"Atabek again when you call Kasravi a pan-Iranian nationalists and not acceptable, then I can call Tapper an anthropologist which he is.  If Kasravi is quoted by scholars such as Minorsky, Frye, Savory then his historical works are obviously acceptable.  Also note this: []  Articles should rely on reliable, third-party published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy. Sources should be appropriate to the claims made: exceptional claims require stronger sources. See Wikipedia:Verifiability#Sources..  Note that is why I quote from Savory a Safavid historian and say that he is stronger source than Tapper who is an anthropologist.  And furthermore I asked for direct proof with regards to your statement.  Actually you quote says: Esmail I proclaimed himself Shah of Azerbaijan.  Now I ask where?  And then you bring me a quote from Tapper who is an anthropologist.  Then I of course say that Savory who is a Safavid historian with much more qualifications does not claim Esmail I made such a proclamation.   It is true that he controlled Gilan also (but perhaps not all of it).. As per Iran , it is mentioned as the country of Safavids by many sources.  Including Sultan Selim I when he attacked Iran. 
 تا ز استانبول لشکر سوی ایران تاختم تاج صوفی غرقه خون و ملامت ساختم.  Thus we have a direct source referring to the country of Esmail I as Iran .  And I do not need to bring direct reference like this because Safavid historians are strong enough source to quote.
 Note I repeat from the source. Although initially ruler of Azerbaijan only, by the year 916/1510 Esma@¿^l was master of the whole of Persia, having crushed the residual forces of the Aq Qoyunlu and driven the Uzbeks out of the northeastern frontier province of Khorasan..  seems correct but either way it is from strong source.  But until we have proof of proclamation from Esmail I himself  I am the Shah of Azerbaijan, then claiming Esmail I proclaimed himself shah of Azerbaijan is not valid.  He proclaimed himself Shah in Azerbaijan is different though as he was crowned in Tarbiz.  And yes he did own part of Gilan as well, and this angle can be argued from Encyclopedia Islam quote which I have brought above already.  So basically I am asking you for the Minorsky quote you mentioned but quoting from an anthropologist when it contradicts Safavid historians or when Safavid historians are stronger source in my opinion is not valid.  
 As per Arbcomm, there are admins I can report personal attacks outside of there and thus I mentioned the warning.   I have no interest for getting personal as you said either.  So lets keep it professional.  Thanks",0.0

Yes, I know, but as I cited above, the disambiguation guidelines appear to recommend having the DAB page link to the """"full"""" name rather than to directly to the real name.  Rome (disambiguation) links to Rome, Italy even though the real article is at Rome.

Now, maybe you're saying that as long as I needed a piped link to satisfy MoS:DAB#Piping exception #3

I might as well go directly to the """"right"""" page.

Note a later sentence in MoS:DAB:
This guidance to avoid piping means that a link to a redirect term will sometimes be preferred to a direct link, if the redirect term contains the disambiguation title and the redirect target does not.
That could be read two ways:  as a way to avoid piping, or as a preference for linking to the disambiguated name in preference to the ambiguous one.

 Naming convention 

I would like to resurrect my previous idea to change the current naming convention for elections. The current convention is:

Use the format """"Demonym type election, date"""", for example """"Canadian federal election, 1867""""...  (WP:NAME#Elections}

I propose this is changed to allow two alternatives, as follows:

Use either this form: political division type election, date, or this form: political division election of date. For example, Canadian federal election, 1867 or Canadian federal election of 1867.  Where an article has been created using one form, do not move the article to the other form.

Biased Viewponit

Just reading this article I've noticed that it fails to mention many of the controversies of cityrail, accusations of sexual harrassment within its staff, chronicle delays, major incidents (such as the breakdown in transport following Queen Mary II etc). When it does mention criticism of CityRail it almost invariably provies (and in many cases gives emphasis to) a counterargument, particularly when the section dedicated to criticism is called """"Challenges"""" and portrays CityRail as being able to best them in all situations.

The way I see it the article reads more as a commercial advertisement, fails to mention many controversial issues surrounding CityRail, and continually praises the corporation through colourful language. This may be just me, but at least add in information about accusations relating to sexism and harrassment in the working culture, public scrutiny of services etc

@ JPG: my apologies for not signing the statement last time, I did not have a regular account and (given this may be more than a minor edit) was trying to borrow my brother's, so I could sign it later. Although I have not made major contributions I have made many minor edits and am well acquainted with the way of wikipedia, and this article clearly, given both this knowledge and the various criticism that CityRail has faced, is biased towards painting the corporation in a positive light. I would appreciate it if you replied instead of deleting under the false presumption of vandalism, and if others who are not regular editors of this article could have their say

Well, that was longer than I anticipated for a title. Oh well. Anyway, do you think I am an arrogant, 'shithead' by reading that? or just a tad 'rant'headed?

Sorry, but your comment was abusive to me aswell, mate. 'I think you should tell him how to treat people'. Okay, I might of took the piss out of some person and I don't know if I did the 'christian' """"faith"""" aswell, I can't remeber to be honest.

Or by the reaction of the first, you be deeply off the scale. I wonder what I said what made the 'christians' came into factor...I really can't remeber. Dam should've saved it. 

About the 'tell him that capps are for shotuing on the internet', I know that all ready. I used it for something called 'emphasis, may of heard it.

 OR removed from page 

I removed the following section due to its entirely being original research and speculation. Per User:SteveLoughran's request, here it is.

The implementation details of S3 are not documented, but it is possible to infer aspects of it from the behaviour (and pricing) of the service.

 There is an S3 repository in the US; there is another in Europe. Their locations are not public.
 From an EC2 server, read access can initially be slow. This could imply that S3 data is not always in the same physical location as all the EC2 servers. 
 Amazon do not bill for data transferred between the US EC2 server farm and the US S3 store, but they do for access between the servers and the European S3 store. While the S3 store and the EC2 servers may be in separate locations, they must be close enough together that cost of transferring data is neglible. Both services are presumably hosted on the same Metropolitan Area Ethernet.
 Connectivity between the S3 datastores and the rest of the Internet is good. This implies they  are close to one of the main Internet exchanges.
 After the initial slow access, later accesses are fast. This could imply that the data is cached.
 Write access is tangibly slower than writing to a local hard disk. Amazon guarantee that when the operation has completed, data has been written to disk in multiple locations. 
 Amazon warn that even after data has been written, old values may still be read. This implies that there can be more than one cache of the data, and that every GET request does not trigger a check from the front-end caches to the back-end store.
 Amazon adjusted their initial pricing from a simple flat rate per GB to one that charges small frequently retrieved items per thousand GET or HEAD operations, rather than purely per byte. There may be a flat cost for every entry (indexing, billing entries) and a per-request cost in CPU-time for every access. These fixed overheads are now billed for.

The dynamic per-bucket DNS entries are implemented by having a custom S3 DNS server that returns a hostname for every host under the s3.amazonaws.com subdomain, even if a bucket of that name has never been created: 
> nslookup made-up-name-for-wikipedia.s3.amazonaws.com

Non-authoritative answer:
made-up-name-for-wikipedia.s3.amazonaws.com     canonical name = s3-directional-w.amazonaws.com.
s3-directional-w.amazonaws.com  canonical name = s3-1-w.amazonaws.com.
Name:   s3-1-w.amazonaws.com
Address: 72.21.211.228

At the identified host, there is a web server that always serves up 404 error pages when a GET request against a nonexistent bucket is issued.

"""Dear Mr. Kohl,
I was in touch with James Boros at the time of the """"Complexity Forum"""", and he communicated his dissatisfaction with the results in no uncertain terms.  Richard Barrett in a published interview alluded to this affair, believing the rejection of his article was owing to bias.  What is more, practically no major younger figures of the New Complexity were included among the published articles, whereas, for instance, Erik Ulman, who is a very fine composer but not a New Complexity composer, was included. Whatever the reasons for the choice of articles, the failure to include major younger figures associated with the New Complexity seriously skewed this entire """"Forum.""""

Secondly, I would beg you to not play childish games by removing composers I have posted. You have done fine work on Stockhausen, but you are by no means an expert on the subject of New Complexity. I have not seen a single article of yours focusing on this subject. I have never seen you at any of the festivals in which numerous works of younger composers associated with the New Complexity were performed, such as the bludenzer tage of the 1990's of the Züricher Tage of the early 1990's.  Why would you dare to remove Wolfram Schurig, co-editor of the primary book series focused on the New Complexity, leader of the bludenzer tage in its most daring period, and composer commissioned by leading ensembles throughout Europe?  If you don't know anything about him, this reflects badly on your claim to be an expert in this field.  Why would you remove Klaus K. Hübler, whose influence on New Complexity composers is clearly stated in multiple articles in the New Music and Aesthetics in the 21st Century series. Marc André has received numerous prestigious awards and commissions, and his work has also been closely associated with New Complexity; one need only read his articles appearing in the New Music and Aesthetics series to find support for this assertion.

I would strongly suggest that you do your homework in this field before you go about arbitrarily altering the contributions of others.  You could begin by going through the first six volumes of the New Music and Aesthetics series, then read numerous articles in Musik & Âsthetik (several references that appeared earlier in this entry have been removed) and works by Claus-Steffen Mahnkopf and others.  Then visit several dozen festival in Europe over an extended period. Then do some score study, perhaps beginning with the composers whose names you have removed.

Fine Art Photography for me began as a hobby and slowly got transformed in to a skilled Profession full of fun, frolic and passion. Today I eat, drink and breathe it.
I have become conversant to my Camera and we follow the instructions given by one to the other. We are like undivided cousins. The WORK and the Recognition in the field of Art Photography compliment to the success as of today…and the show goes on and on…

 Semi-protected edit request on 25 March 2015 

One Direction (commonly abbreviated as 1D) are an English-Irish pop boy band based in London, comprising Niall Horan, Liam Payne, Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson. Zayn Malik was formerly a member leaving the band on March 25th 2015. They signed with Simon Cowell's record label Syco Records after forming and finishing third in the seventh series of the British televised singing competition The X Factor in 2010. Propelled to international success by social media, One Direction's four albums, Up All Night (2011), Take Me Home (2012), Midnight Memories (2013) and Four (2014) broke records, topped charts in most major markets, and generated hit singles including """"What Makes You Beautiful"""", """"Live While We're Young"""", """"Story of My Life"""" and """"Steal My Girl"""".

Their achievements include five Brit Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards, eleven MTV Europe Music Awards, and nineteen Teen Choice Awards out of nineteen nominations, among many others. According to Nick Gatfield, the chairman and chief executive of Sony Music Entertainment UK, One Direction represented a $50 million business empire by June 2012. They were proclaimed 2012's """"Top New Artist"""" by Billboard. According to the Sunday Times Rich List, by April 2013, they had an estimated personal combined wealth of £25 million ($41.2m) making them the second-wealthiest musicians in the UK under 30 years of age. In 2014, Forbes listed them the second-highest earning celebrities under 30, with the group earning an estimated $75 million from June 2013 to June 2014.""""Justin Bieber is Forbes' highest-earning celebrity under 30 pocketing $80m this year... which should just about cover his costly legal woes"""". Mail Online. Retrieved 25 November 2014

After the release of Four, One Direction became the first band in the U.S. Billboard 200 history to have their first four albums début at number one.{{cite news|",0.0

Some additional facts from the poll (latest update)
To confound some of the disinformation on the talk pages (where my analysis is censored) I have examined the entire list of preferences by (non-British) Irish editors, of whom so far 21 have voted who self-identify as such on their page: 
Option D - 20  
Option C - 17  
Option B - 16  
Option E - 16  
Option A - 14  
Option F - 12  
Actually I keep this and several other facts analyzed on an on-going basis; I held this back while the """"RoI"""" pushers made fools of themselves claiming that the data showed Irish editors actually favoured F! The current poll is heading to impose, again, the British favoured pov, the one  least favoured by Irish editors out of 6 options. (Analysis of the British votes another cay). But we must keep this hidden in case it upsets the F Troops.

I asked you to prove you can't appeal an ITN decision, not whether you had ever seen it done or not. The appeal venue is obviously the talk page, or I suppose the talk page of the person who made the decision. I went to the talk page, and nobody said I couldn't appeal, they just rejected it out of hand. If I contravened the no appeal rule, they're certainly being very coy about it. And quite obviously it doesn't take 7 days to figure out if a decision was wrong - and in case you hadn't noticed, 4 days later and Gerry Adams is still under arrest, and it's still in the news, so even in this case, I'm sure if Wikipedia wasn't such a dysfunctional place, the veracity of the original decision could have been examined exhaustively by now. But no, you all seem to prefer to handle it quite differently - prefering to talk endless rubbish about sticks and horses and telling people they don't understand things, things that you're all not even prepared to answer a few simple questions about.

But it's fruitless replying to him because he's so stuck on the fact that he's right even in the face of overwhelming evidence that he's wrong. He thinks like this. He doesn't understand at all that we follow what the sources say, except for when it suits him. And that he insists that the information in the Lesbianism in erotica article about studies showing that men are more sexually aroused by lesbian pornography than heterosexual pornography makes my head hurt. He acts like we are presenting opinions as fact, when all we are really do is presenting the findings of several studies  not one, but several. In his opinion, we shouldn't include this information because he doesn't consider the evidence strong enough. Yet he considers """"just googl[ing] the most purchased adult videos,"""" """"see[ing] what they're about"""" and this """"would correspond to male arousal quite well"""" to be strong enough evidence. Most heterosexual men buying heterosexual porn doesn't mean that most heterosexual men are more turned on by heterosexual porn than lesbian porn.

 To bear in mind when writing articles """"Camera obscura""""  and """"Pinhole camera"""" 

Q. “Is a camera obscura the same as a pinhole camera?”

A. No. A pinhole camera is a type of camera obscura, as are all photographic cameras. The pinhole camera starts with a enclosed container (AKA the """"dark room"""") with a very small opening to let in the light. It is therefore a camera obscura. Cameras that use an actual pinhole size aperture are used to expose photographic film or paper but have limited use as viewing or drawing devices because the light that the pinhole admits is very dim and the image would be very hard to see. Most camera obscuras are made with lenses in the aperture since this makes the image much brighter and sharper. Room sized camera obscuras are sometimes made with lensless apertures but these openings are much larger than a pinhole. We have been told that an opening about the size of a US quarter can work well in some rooms.

"Bot tagging 

Greetings,
I have seen your name everywhere already. Thanks for your recent attention to WP:PHILO and the aesthetics dept. I had recently been working on the logic project. I did quite a bit of work on it, and then ran up against some cultural issues.

I wanted to get User:SatyrBot (an apparently wonderful service!!) to automatically tag articles with the new logic banner for the purpose of assessment. I put together a category list, publicized the issue, and then moved forward with no objection. Well the complainers came out of the woodwork! The bot was stopped and at this point most have been untagged. I find all of this quite terrible.

Since then, I have been working on WP:PHILO with all of these task forces. I got the sense that people were a lot less uptight in general over there. I have changed direction a bit and now am advocating that the philosophy project tag incorporate these fields and be placed appropriately, etc. However, there is no real enthusiasm for the auomatic bot tagging proposal. Although there is far less hostility to it!  

I intend to ask the bot to tag just the Aesthetics project and see how things go. I haven't put this proposal out to WP:PHILO yet, I wanted to give you a chance to comment on it. Any advice or support in these goals would be appreciated.",0.0

Misessus, I will leave you to the mercy of Wikipedia.  -) -) -)

Daniel, I have only one view. It agrees with yours and part of Misessus. Kind of neutral, hey? 

Daniel, although I feel your are an honest broker, you wear the blinkers of what is generally accepted and you are quite paranoid and a bit naive. You should learn with time to place more trust in the good faith of mankind and not to believe everything you read on Wikipedia as always the absolute factual truth. Remember, new discoveries are being made all the time, peer reviewed and then revealed to the general public - even here on Wikipedia, although you do not realize it. You have read it many times in the article but you cannot see the difference it makes to everything in the economy.

Daniel, not everyone is only interested in """"yanking your chain"""" (I am not sure I even know exactly what it means) and all that jazz: some of us are actually interested in real economics and its development and will seek to take the best from every school of thought (including the Austrians) and build the future thereon.

What really happens is that the node between the two caps gets charged up (or down, depending on whether the + or - ends are connected together) and stays charged, so that both caps are biased with sufficient dc that their voltage never goes negative.  The reliable source we have cited there (app note from a cap manufacturer) says that you don't really need the diodes, because the caps will act as diodes and conduct in the reverse direction to accomplish that effect.  I would think it would be more reliable to have that reversed current flow through a diode, but given that it's only a transient phenomenon as the cap charges up I can see that in some applications it could be acceptable to do it without the diodes.",0.0

Speaking of objectivity: while what I said regarding the copula was a plausible argument for using the upper case, the fact is that different people capitalize differently in that particular situation.

Well as for Bynes her father's surname doesn't really match either, does it? I find surnames in 2006 can be grossly misleading and don't necessarily mean much. In 1900, sure, but at this point everyone's changed their names and intermarried enough that you can't tell who is what by last name. Why wouldn't Eli's father be Jewish? He's Joseph Cross, also the father of actress Flora Cross, who is Jewish but whose mother is apparently not Eli's mother. There are seemingly a bunch of Jewish """"Cross""""'s out there, anyway. Well in the case of footnotes the point is really - the list is called a list of Jewish people - so the most important part is really whether the person themselves is """"Jewish"""". The mistake I guess many made before is thinking that the most important part was whether one of their parents or something are Jewish. I think adding a quote about Elvis' ancestry however is important since in his case it is a big stretch and it's for the most part, something that biographers added on after his death, so it would definitely be helpful. But in cases like Bynes, Lauren Storm, plenty of others it's really mostly irrelevant if they are not """"ethnically"""" fully Jewish (and besides, that can be found out in their entry), same for the other X-American lists, establishing that someone is Italian-American is good enough, for example, on List of Italian American actors, I'm sure Tina Majorino's mother isn't Italian (with Italians, unlike Jews, you can obviously tell that if someone's mother's maiden name is """"Black"""" they are most likely not Italian) but the source just calls her Italian, so that's good enough for us. Family tree stuff isn't the most important. Plus - of course - most of the quotes in the numbers for people who are half already say they are half - but I'll go over them below here. As for practicing Judaism - well of the people who are half and whose one non-Jewish parent didn't convert in the 1980s - LaBeouf was raised Jewish/practices and the source quoted says he is Cajun also, Scarlett wore a Star of David to a bunch of events, Jake Gyllenhaal was raised Jewish, and the quote says he is only Jewish on his mother's side anyway, Grey raised Jewish, Flynn's mother apparently converted, Feldman raised Jewish and the quote says his mother wasn't, Carter quote says his father is Jewish only, Bynes says she is """"Jewish"""" and we don't even know which parent (actually for the longest time Wikipedia, under someone's assumption, had """"Jewish mother"""". But this was removed once I came in and started purging these assumption games other editors played and started putting in only verified facts )), Bilson quote says she is half Italian half Jewish, ditto for Baldoni, Paxton quote says all we know, that she is Jewish (maybe her non-Jewish parent converted), Peck grew up with a Jewish single mother, he doesn't know who his biological father was and he was likely Jewish anyway, Prepon we don't know which parent, Reed's brother had a Bar Mitzvah and sources/herself have called her """"Jewish"""", Schwartzman - dunno, Sigler mother converted, Thomas raised Jewish, and the source says his father isn't anyway, Vuolo father converted, Wilson raised Jewish, I think that's about it. So, as you can see, for a large number of these, the quote already says that they aren't """"ethnically"""" all Jewish if that was relevant. OK, as for JInfo, yes, it seems to definitely fall under """"some guy's website"""". It does sometime cite sources, right? But often it doesn't. So I would say, yes, generally do not use it.  """,0.0

"Maybe you should ask Musical Linguist... 

Ahh... she problaby does not have time.  OK. Here is the joke: Mark Fuhrman, with his LAPD police badge and his gun, with all of those yummmy bullets in it, would do traffic stops on black people.  If you think that was a DWB kind of thing, well, other might feel that way too... Anyway the joke is this:  He did not love those niggers that stopped, he loved the effect that using, under color of authority (pun intended), the WORD nigger has on them emotionally.  See, if he could just get an emotional repsonse from those niggers, he might be able to create an excuse in order to insert some of those yummy bullets into them.  Mostly, those niggers just sat and and took it.  Some non-admin Wikipedians find themselves in the same situation as those guys. Ironically, Mark probably makes a lot more money with his books now than he ever did as a policeman.  Provided that people merely purchase and read his books, but do not actually take them seriously, maybe we are all better off that way. He's got more money.  He does not use the n-word anymore.  He does not carry a gun and use the n-word under color of authority.  Surely, that is best of all possible worlds, is it not?",0.0

 Jehovah's Witnesses Related Question 

Hi Jeffro,

I don't remember ever actually writing any Wikipedia comments before, so forgive me if my formatting ends up wonky. I was just looking for lists of Watchtower Publications to help me with my collection, when I stumbled across this page and section: 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Watch_Tower_Society_publications#Primary_study_aids

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_Watch_Tower_Society_publications#Study_aids

The heading """"These publications are intended to convert interested individuals"""" struck me as a bit jarring and out of place. For one, the immediate next header is: """"Secondary aids are considered just before or shortly after baptism"""" so it is not even consistent. Secondly, I am not sure that I agree with the talk page reason you give for keeping the header, as it includes original research (private interpretation of primary sources) and citations of a publication that might not even apply to all of the books listed, e.g., how does a 1980's Kingdom Ministry support the statement that """"Studies in the Scriptures is intended to convert interested individuals""""? Thirdly and lastly, making statements about intent is always notoriously difficult and subject to conflicting interpretation, while making statements of fact is much simpler and should be preferred.  

With that in mind, a possible alternative header might be something like:

""""These publications are generally considered prior to baptism"""" 

It is concise, clear, consistent with the other headers and doesn't make assumptions about intent, only fact. May I have your thoughts?   
(You have previously commented at Wikipedia Talk pages, and you had mastered Wiki-formatting such as indenting at the time. You also referred to yourself in the third person a few times. I hope you've recovered from that oddity.)
The intended purpose of the 'Bible study' program offered by Jehovah's Witnesses most definitely is to convert individuals to the JW faith, though the students are not told of that goal at the outset of the study. For example:
""""Your goal is to help the student achieve greater insight into the truth, qualify as an unbaptized publisher, and become a dedicated and baptized Witness of Jehovah""""—Our Kingdom Ministry, April 2001, page 5;
Chapter 18 of What Does the Bible Really Teach?, pages 174–183;
Your alternative wording would therefore be misleading, because the students don't start out with any intention of being baptised as members of the religion—they just think they're 'learning more about the Bible'. Your wording would only be suitable if the order of events was a) a person wants to be baptised as a JW; b) they study the necessary literature; c) they get baptised.  
I have added references to the article supporting the fact that the publications are used with the goal of converting individuals.

The information is incomplete and the issue to complex to be simply summed with such a biased quote.

Why want you quote instead  just Stachura who writes about """"Jewish opposition to Polish independence""""? Why not qualify it with Levy, who notes that """"Jews were the victims of thousands of pogroms, dozens of them in Poland""""? Why not use Davies explanation that it was the normal wartime conditions (Polish-Ukrainian War, Polish-Soviet War) and not any targeted antisemitism that led to vast majority of Jewish deaths? Why not quote the contemporary observer, Sir Horace Rumbold, 9th Baronet, who wrote (cited by Davies) that """"the condition [of the Jews] in Poland, bad as it may have been or may still be, has been far better than in most of the surrounding countries""""? The sentence, as it is currently, shows a biased POV, and needs to be rewritten to be neutral.

"""== Early Chicago computer club ==
Hi, thanks for all your efforts!!!

Not sure if you wanted me to answer via your talk page. 

AFAICR (made that up - As Far As I Can Remember) the Chicago computer club I was involved with was C.A.C.H.E., the Chicago Area Computer Hobbyists Exchange. 

I believe there was a meeting approx Apr '75, begun by Robert Swartz, who was lucky enough to be able to affort a """"Digital Systems"""" original 8080 """"box"""" - and the CP/M operating system.  

(Digital Systems was right up the road from Gary Kildall (the CP/M guy)so they got together.  - One making a rugged box and the other the OS for it). 

The """"hobby"""" as I see it really took off with the MITS Altair on the cover of the January, 1975 issue of Popular Electronics. 

[Back to Chicago Club] SO one day reading Pop'tronics, I noticed a piece saying there had been a computer club in the Chicago area, naming the people who attended, and saying when the next one was.    As I recall it was Lloyd Smith (now my best friend) formerly of Dyer IN, and Bill Burther, Valparaiso IN (R.I.P.).  

SO we rode together to that possibly 2nd, or perhaps 3rd meeting (? Sept 1975) and I was hooked. 

MY involvement with the club was to be an """"active participant"""" in that for ex. I was sec'y for many years, wrote programs to maintain the mailing list, help with the newsletter, often whipping up a small newsletter myself when no one else helped (this was one of the events that led to the invention of the BBS).  I brought my system in to show, back when maybe one in 10 actually HAD a system. 

My home system consisted of an Altair 8080, to which I had added a Selectric Typewriter and Dynastor FLYING HEAD disk drive (a whopping 256K, yes, KAY).   I had to (1) teach myself digital electronics; and (2) design and create the board to interface to these uniquely-mine peripherals (Ex: Type a char on the selectric (terminal) and watch what came in - on an oscilloscope) THEN program the altair to """"produce outputs that matched that timing"""", learning that  gasp IBM put the parity bit at the opposite end of the word than most of the rest of the world!)

My machine also  once """"video"""" became available (I skipped the """"TV Typewriter"""" phase), a 16 x 64 display called a Processor Technology Video Display Module.  (and no coincidence, the BBS Randy Suess and I invented and I programmed, had a 16 x 64 size message limit at first). 

THEN my world opened to assembler programming (not hand assembling or some other hack) when Processor Technology came out with a paper tape-distributed editor and 8080 assembler.  (I seem to recall it having 4 things, but don't recall now.)

I modified the PT Asm to run on cassette tapes (The """"Tarbell"""" having become a standard) and called the combination of things the """"CACHE Cassette Operating System"""" (CCOS) and several people in the club started writing assembler programs.  

SO anyway, the club had a huge variety of machines represented - from the """"boards"""" - Kim-1, ?? Trying to remember if the Apple-1 was a """"board"""" - I think so and the little Sinclair """"pocket calculator"""" sized ones from TI or with a TI chip.  

When the Radio Shack computers came along, many of us pioneers thought """"this is the end of the hobby"""".  What we meant was, for example (maybe an extreme example) - I could design and make my own boards, AND write the BIOS routines to run them, etc, and THAT was more the fun - so someone buying a """"built"""" machine seemed kind of sad.  However, this is the march of time, and I'm sure the """"Hams"""" (amateur radio enthusiasts) felt a bit the same way as more and more products came along making it easier and easier to """"talk over the air""""..   I eventually - and somewhat delinquently - adopted the PC, but by then had pretty much """"burned out"""" programming as a hobby, and did not make a LOT of contributions in that area. 

____ END _____ of my thoughts on the club, is this what you were looking for?  

Just to """"come to a better close""""  the fact I'd done my own HW meant incompatability, so I invented MODEM.ASM (named  and it stuck  Xmodem by Keith Peterson) to be able to """"beep"""" things back and forth with friends; 

Then the BBS came about as ME thinking a dial-in system to gather articles for a newsletter, but Randy Suess suggested a club project would be """"by committee"""" so just the two of us - him HW and me SW - did it, independently of the club.  — Preceding unsignedcomment added by  (talk • contribs)

"""Kurt and Dave get it on?==

Groaning Kurt released his cock. For the past week he hadn't been able to get off. He tried a cocktail of drugs and a cocktail of whores. Nothing was doing it for him. Masturbating in the shower wasn't even working. Oh he was getting hard all right, he just couldn't fucking cum. And it was driving him nuts.

To top it off, he didn't know why he couldn't cum. The girls had been either hot enough or slutty enough. Even the couple of guys he brought home had been decent. Despite that, he couldn't fucking cum. And a week of that was enough to make anyone more pissy than normal.

Which meant band practice was unlikely to be much fun for anyone.

That was made abundantly clear the moment Kurt stepped into the rehearsal studio. His eyes flicked from Krist to Dave and he came to a sudden stop. Dave was sitting on a couch, a pretty girl in his lap giggling. It was like he was taunting Kurt. And he would have nothing of that.

Stalking over to the drummer and the floozie, Kurt pulled her forcibly out of his lap. The girl squealed and Dave growled, but Kurt paid no attention, forcing the girl out of the studio. After slamming the door he headed back over to Dave. Without a word he pulled the drummer to him and kissed him possessively.

Dave shoved Kurt away, """"What part of no don't you fucking understand!?""""

Krist's eyes widened and he took a step forward, """"Guys, I think—""""

Kurt sent him a silent glare, silencing and stopping him.

""""I don't want you, Kurt. I don't even fucking like you right now,"""" Dave growled. """"In fact, I fucking quit! I don't have to put up with this shit. You're fucking insane. You need some other crackwhore to take my place. I'm not it.""""

Sidestepping the singer, Dave headed towards the door. He barely made three steps before Kurt grabbed him again. This time his back was pulled to Kurt's front. He could clearly feel the singer's erection pressing into his ass.

He wasn't going to be anyone's bitch.

""""I'm just gonna... go,"""" Krist muttered before slipping out of the room quickly.

""""You're fucking mine, Dave,"""" Kurt declared, licking Dave's neck. """"Always.""""

For as small as he was, Kurt had more strength than Dave expected. With considerably less effort than he would have figured, the singer forced the drummer down to the floor. Dave wiggled and tried to crawl away, but all that resulted was in Kurt pulling the drummer's pants off.

Laying down on top of Dave while he worked his own pants off, Kurt hissed in his ear, """"You're mine. You hear me? Fucking mine.""""

""""Stop! Kurt, stop!"""" Dave struggled.

With Kurt's weight on him, the drummer had very little maneuverability. He was completely trapped. But that didn't mean he stopped trying to get away. While wholly his struggling was probably a good thing, it wasn't really helping. If anything it was turning Kurt on more.

Not having the patience to remove Dave's boxers, Kurt reached down and tore the back seam, exposing the drummer's ass. He didn't even pause to warn Dave. His hands spread Dave's cheeks, spit down his crack to provide some lubrication, and quickly pushed his cock in. Dave screamed, wiggling once more to get away. With Kurt's hands holding onto his hips, he had no chance to go anywhere, at least not until the singer was done.

Dave's screams faded into sobs. That alone drove Kurt further, faster. He loved everything about it. The way Dave's ass squeezed his cock better than anyone else's had before. He was a perfect glove, a perfect fit. Before too long a week's worth of unreleased cum spurted from Kurt's cock.

Slowly he pulled out, not really caring about the mixture of blood and semen leaking from Dave's ass. Grinning to himself he refastened his pants. He glanced at Dave, a feeling of superiority infusing him. He totally owned Dave now. 

Does anyone have any basis for this rumour? I would love to put it on the main page.  
Um... No. Just no. Did you pull that out of some dirty sex novel or what? Talk

For 4 of the 13 (Donduseni, Drochia, Dubasari and Edinet) I did also a little bit more: I looked into the 1930 map and 1930 tables, and I have identified the former names. (A few current hamlets do not appear in 1930, so those have no former names.) This is a very interesting process and I kind of like it (I like reading maps), but it is too much time consuming, so I guess I won't do this now for the rest. (Will do it sometimes later.) 
Also, perhaps I shouldn't fill in now more data as I did for Drochia district (I did it there mostly because I wanted to have one-two districts done well.) I am afraid if I don't get to the bottom of the 32... 19 is still a large number... \talk",0.0

"My explanation
Hi,
I'm glad you like the Using a personal computer as a multitrack recording device section. Thanks!
The reason for my edit is that the paragraph you are referring to:
 Some of the leading providers of multitracking software for a personal computer....
is repeated twice in the article. 

If you read the History section's last paragraph you will see it there. Then if you read the Using a personal computer as a multitrack recording device section, you will see it there as well with a slight addition.

I deleted this paragraph from the Using a personal computer as a multitrack recording device section, since it had to be deleted from either one of the two sections. 

The reason I deleted it from the Using a personal computer as a multitrack recording device section is because the History section has a line about how multitracking software has been written for personal computers:
 At the same time, with the power of the personal computer increasing, multitracking software was written for it ... 
And this is where this paragraph was originally.

If you see the edit differences between my deletion and your addition, you will clearly see the paragraph appearing  twice.

If you think that the paragraph belongs in the Using a personal computer as a multitrack recording device section instead of the History section, that works for me too!

Hope you will find my explanation adequate.",0.0

 What I addad 

The below was liked. If someone wants to chop this down and add it, be my guest. ~   

In 2012, the Journal of Palestine Studies was forced to translate and publish a 1937 letter of David Ben-Gurion after the pressure group CAMERA reported an error made in a journal article written by Pappé. In his article, Pappé had written, """"Ben-Gurion, for example, wrote in a letter to his son in 1937, 'The Arabs will have to go, but one needs an opportune moment for making it happen, such as a war, citing pages 167–68 of David Smith's 2004 Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict. After checking Smith's book for the quote, CAMERA noticed that there had been an error in citation, and wrote to JPS saying so: """"the quote attributed to Ben-Gurion does not appear in the citation provided."""" The JPS verified this, but in doing so highlighted something that CAMERA had not:

The JPS, for its part, does not mention that the paperback version of Pappé's book, certainly at least the 2011 reprint, uses (p. 23) the quote with the same mark positioning as the JPS article—""""The Arabs will have to go, but one needs an opportune moment for making it happen, such as a war."""" The paperback provides different sources to the Smith citation used in the journal article, though: """"Ben-Gurion's Diary, 12 July 1937, and in New Judea, August–September 1937, p. 220.""""

Having uncovered these citation errors and discrepancies, the journal decided to go the final step and have the entirety of Ben-Gurion's letter translated into English. The translated letter confirms that, regardless of citation errors, the underlying interpretation of the letter provided by Pappé's article and book was sound. In the letter to his son, Ben-Gurion is quite clear: """"We must expel Arabs and take their place.""""""",0.0

Opening Bias 

In the opening segment (If that's what you call it - I mean the first content, before the table of contents), there is the following paragraph:

The conflict killed at least 1,200 people, mostly Lebanese citizens,[38][39][40] severely damaged Lebanese civil infrastructure, and displaced approximately one million Lebanese[41] and 300,000–500,000 Israelis.[26][42][43] After the ceasefire, some parts of southern Lebanon remained uninhabitable due to Israeli unexploded cluster bomblets.[44]

It is blatantly obvious how anti-Israeli this paragraph is. The information might be true, and there is some doubt as to whether it actually is, but the way in which it is organized, especially in the opening segment, is ridiculously biased. A reader would probably read it whilst skimming the article, as it is the shortest paragraph in the opening segment, and then get the following information: Israel killed many Lebanese citizens; Lebanese civil infrastructure, which means hospitals, roads, etc., was destroyed by Israel, Israel displaced twice as much Lebanese civilians, and they used cluster bombs which render some Lebanese area uninhabitable.

Completely biased. Completely anti-Israeli. Completely ridiculous. Completely unacceptable of a Wikipedia article, especially a """"good"""" article.

I recommend either changing the wording (Maybe removing 'mostly Lebanese citizens', 'Lebanese', and changing it to approximately 1.5 million people displaced, as well as completely omitting the last sentence). The entire paragraph could be removed entirely, with some of the more important information being integrated to other paragraphs.

And, full disclosure, I am currently leaving in Israel, but I would be writing this irregardless of my current location; biased articles are biased articles globally. I was not influenced by my current country.""",0.0

Speedy deletion of Will berardelli
 A tag has been placed on Will berardelli requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

Also, everything you linked to Dennis Brown, was quite obviously meant as humor. """"ALL I DID WAS TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT COAL WITH SOURCES. Those who blocked me ARE IN THE POCKET OF BIG COAL AND I EXPOSED THEIR NEFARIOUS plots. Please FREE KINGSHOWMAN!"""" 

Don't Wikipedia editors catch obvious attempts at humour? Perhaps you didn't find them funny, but they were meant as attempts at levity during the heated so-called """"Coal Wars"""". I was also not entirely alone in the position I took there on coal which was simply that a paragraph needed to be added to the lead to reflect Coal's Health and Environmental Effects. I wasn't taking an unreasonable position, and you will now see, that thanks to my tireless, thankless efforts to improve this encylopedia, that information is now in the lead on Coal. (not through reverts by me, but by others who agreed with my position.) I have not edited coal since my block, so I'm not quite sure how it makes sense to blocvk me again for something that I haven't gone back to doing.

Also, I did not harrass Flyer22. She harrassed me. May I relate the course of events,  which you may verify? First of all, I stopped communicating with her since she requested that I do so. Second of all, she got steamed because I added a paragraph on Nietzsche to her """"Happiness"""" article under the section """"Philsoophy of Happiness."""" Arguably (as other editors agreed) Nietzsche may have something valuable to say here, and I very quiickly made a summary of the SEP article on Nietzsche's moral philosophy on this topic. No, it wasn't perfect and the referencing could have used improvement, but it was better than omitting it and leaving readers with a somewhat one-sided impression of the Great Philosophers on Happiness. Flyer22 reverted my edit, giving a basically spurious reason: """"Unsourced"""" as I recall. But it was directed to THE MOST RELIABLE source on Philosophy, by general and academic consensus, the SEP. It would in fact be very easy to improve a great deal of Wiki Philosophy articles by just having editors sum up information from this wonderful free, peer-reviewed, academically rigorous resource.

Then, withouit provocation, after I asked her what exactly she found problematic about including Nietzsche in a list of philosophers who have written about Happiness, including similar statured luminaries like Augustine, Aquinas, Aristotle, Mill, etc. she responded, not by listing what was wrong with my Happiness edit, but by telling me """"ALL OF YOUR EDITS ARE POOR, PURE AND SIMPLE. YOU ARE A POOR EDITOR."""" I thought this was rather rude and ignorant, especfially as she saw fit to specifically attack my Hume edits (when Hume was not under discussion) telling me """"your edits on Hume largely consit of such (read=poor) edits and I'm tempted to revert them."""" Since I hate to see a poor soul suffering under the weight of such crushing temptation, I gave in to the temptation myself, and deleted all of my contributions from this encylopedia. Within hours, a throng of rebellion began to emerge,. a grass-roots protest movement which demanded the immediate return of all the much-loved Kingshowman edits to the encylopedia. Editors rushed to my defense. I told Flyer22 to eat crow and admit that, contra her opinion, my Hume edits and contributions to this beloved tome of knowledge were not so poor after all. She declined and escalated her attacks. She was the one who harrassed me, and I thought we were done with this sordid little episode until she popped back up, eager to participate in the latest round of mob justice.

I removed the (big soup) claim at the top of the article and revised the Etymology section.  Minestra is Italian for soup and -one is an augmentative suffix.  It could be translated as """"big soup,"""" but that is perhaps too literal.  In any case, saying that it means """"big soup"""" does not aid understanding, but rather confuses.  Why is it big?  Is it made in large quantities?  Are the vegetables big?  And so on.  It is sufficient to say that minestra means soup and -one is an augmentative suffix.
Under Etymology, I made changes to improve conciseness.  It is not necessary to cite every etymologically related word (i.e., """"minister"""" and """"minus""""); in fact, doing so clearly caused confusion since an editor in the History section of this article refers the reader to the Etymology section for the 14th c. appearance of minestrone.  Quite apart from being OR (that's another copy-edit) it is incorrect; the 14th c. is when the verb """"to minister"""" appeared in English.  It has nothing whatever to do with vegetable soup except for deriving ultimately from the same Latin root.   """,0.0

Evils of Atheism

It's about damn time somebody taught atheists their own medicine, and before you ask, I do not generalize, I think there's a cultural distinction between atheism and nonbelievers. Atheists tend to be enraged over religion of any kind, and spend a lot of time elevating Darwin and bemoaning the Crusades. Nonbelievers in general - say, someone who's raised a Christian, believes the Bible is an allegory, and only attends church for a funeral or perhaps at Christmastime - tend to adopt a """"Whatever gets you through the night"""" philosophy and be quiet on matters of faith. It's sort of like the difference between a devout vegetarian and someone who hates the taste of meat. Atheists are proud of their hate.

 The beliefs of a man who has been dead for over 2000 years and whose teachings are attested to by a variety of variant traditions spread over an entire continent are never just 'obvious', and I am certainly not attempting to limit who can edit the article.  If there are scholarly sources that state that early Buddhism included a belief in Brahman as it is currently understood by Hindus, then attribute the statement to the source and indicate where it originates.  Furthermore, the place where that line is added (""""So then..."""") still makes no logical sense.  In a paragraph where what is being discussed is the use of the same word to hold different meanings by the Buddhist and Hindu tradition, presenting """"so the historical Buddha believed in this Hindu concept"""" as a conclusion- particularly without citation- is an absolute non sequitur.  Further, you are still not understanding my point regarding altering cited text.  It seems (though I don't have access to the source) that we have one source that is saying that there is a consensus regarding the dating of the Bhagavad Gita.  If that consensus does not exist among scholars, than surely there must be an academic source that states outright that such a consensus does not exist.  If you wish to alter the statement that provides dating for the BG, you need to provide a source which demonstrates that the previous content is incorrect or under dispute.  We simply need to be clear about attributing- both in terms of sources, and in terms of who holds these particular beliefs- the ideas in this article, rather than adding sweeping statements that claim to present the 'true' teachings of Buddha.  None of us have the 'true' teachings of Buddha- what we have are traditions that have been passed down and interpreted over the years.  Each tradition has its own opinion on what the true situation is.

While I agree that this article isn't FA material, I must suggest that your added criticism in the lead is also repetitive.  The SPLC's opinion of the show is referenced throughout.  At the very least, your edit should be amended to read that The Political Cesspool has hosted FORMER members of the Ku Klux Klan. In fact, the only one I can find for sure is David Duke, who has also been interviewed by every major talk radio and television program in the country.  (Perhaps it should read, """"a former member of the Ku Klux Klan."""")  Furthermore, Duke was in the Klan in the 1970's, nearly three decades before The Political Cesspool first went on the air.  Does Wolf Blitzer's Wiki entry read that he has hosted Klan members?  Duke has appeared on Blitzer's show.

There are already many people who feel that this article is flagrantly biased.  Right or wrong, to have it read as though this radio program frequently interviews current members of the """"Ku Klux Klan"""" is misleading.

Really? Puny pictures in which you can almost not see what her eye color is. You need a magnifying glass to see her eyes. Don't show such pictures cuz it just looks really sloppy and desperate, which in your case makes sense. 1(By magnifying this image up to 400%, you can clearly see her eye color looks sort of olive green, not anywhere close to brown). 2(What the f*** is this? It look horrendous. Oh and her eyes are lighter than her hair and you keep saying they're the same shade, when clearly they're not. Lets take a look at a better quality image. No brown eyes here.)

3(These eyes can still be called hazel.) 4(Hazel eyes due to their nature have the tendency to look goldish brown in certain lights, and look at Belle's hair it looks red). 5(I can clearly see her eyes are not the same as her hair, in fact take a close look when a lock of hair falls in front of her right eyes and clashes with her eyes color. The difference looks brown and hazel, instead of brown and light brown.) 6(That's not a screenshot, and by magnifying the image, her eyes look dark hazel and so not the same color as her hair) 7(400% zoom in, hazel eyes) 8(What a desperate image, you can barely see anything, 1000% zoom in and her eyes appear not to be brown again). 9(400% zoom in, hazel eyes... again)

Oh yes, the Belle merchandise that has her with brown eyes is so big, only one of the pictures you send can sort of qualify. 10 (By magnifying the image up to 400%, you can clearly see her eyes look green-like). 11(400% zoom in, hazel eyes AGAIN)

JESUS F***ING CHRIST. You preseted me with like 18 images and almost all of them have Belle with hazel eyes instead of brown. ARE YOU COLORBLIND? Don't you know how to differentiate colors. An you call this SOLID? If Belle's eyes are hazel, than those are indeed solid, verified evidence. And the screenshots aren't even from the Diamond Edition, they're from the Special Edition.

Take a look at these pics, please. Think anyone will believe you that her eyes are brown? I don't think so. These are just a couple of additions to the pictures you presented, further cementing that Belle has hazel eyes instead of brown. Since hazel is a mix of brown and green and that hazel eyes vary between almost green to almost brown, on what bases are people suppose to believe Belle's eyes are brown?

"""User:BillyTFried: Threatening Behavior?    
This is an interesting question for the Wikipedia community: Does posting a link on a member’s Talk page to a YouTube video of yourself firing a weapon constitute threatening behavior?Background: In the article about San Francisco Supervisor Chris Daly, I have been debating BillyTFried about whether the article should include information about Daly’s support of a 2006 gun control ballot initiative, Proposition H. I said it shouldn’t because Daly was only one of four sponsors of the initiative, and the initiative wasn’t especially controversial in SF (it won with 58% of the vote). However, because the initiative was controversial in the eyes of many pro-gun groups, it made national headlines with Daly’s name featured in newspaper articles, etc., BillyTFried thought Proposition H should be included in the Chris Daly article.YouTube video: Yesterday night, BillyTFried posted some words on my Talk page along with a link to a YouTube video of himself firing what looks like a semi-automatic weapon. (In case the video gets taken down, it is 1:43 minutes long and shows BillyTFried firing weapons at a shooting range while thrash music plays. BillyTFried occasionally leers at the camera. The video is titled “Shoot Em' Up!”.)

Last night when I read his post, I thought it was just plain weird and creepy, but I didn’t feel threatened. This morning, however, I mentioned it to my wife, who was horrified. She pointed out that BillyTFried lives in the same town as me (he told me the cross streets where he lives) and that his post on my Talk page with the video link was made in the context of a gun control debate. She thought he was threatening me.

I did not take up this matter with BillyTFried because, frankly, after watching his video, I don't want anything to do with him. I’m just curious what the community thinks of this and whether some action should be taken against BillyTFried.

I have 2 admin accounts, 5 non-admin accounts of previously active users which I've since been able to commandeer (more on this later), and about 10 standard self-created accounts.

Oh, and regarding the commandeering of accounts: graphical analysis password bypass and deconstruction (GAPBAD) is a rather effective means to obliterate CAPTCHA; its use is only feasible at specific time intervals when security measures on the target fluctuate or do not register properly. Guess which account is getting targeted next as soon as Wikipedia undergoes its next server hash? ). You've been warned in advance. Just remember: I win. You can't do anything to me.

"Status and Advice
As reviewing administrator,  I think saying someone is a professor at Georgia Tech is at least a possible indication of notability, so I did not delete the article. But you need to add more information to show it, in our  Wikipedia  style; a good place to start learning it  is    our guide to writing Wikipedia articles .  See also our standard, WP:PROF for what we consider notable in articles of this sort. 

First, give the basic informationthe source should be the CV birthplace and date, degrees, previous positions. If there are published books, list them in formal bibliographic style. List the 3 or 4 most influential articles similarly, getting citation figures from Web of Science. Include major national level offices and awards, but not minor ones. Be sure to list editorships (but not mere editorial board membership) we consider it very important, and you should add it to the articles for the relevant journals also, with a link to the bio. 

If the person has any notable students who would qualify for Wikipedia bios, include them. Their PhD & postdoctoral advisors probably also qualify for bios here; add them and link them, even if they do not yet have articles. 

It is not necessary to cite the basic information in detail to other than the official CV. However, give any actual references providing substantial coverage from  3rd party independent published reliable sources, print or online, but not blogs or press releases, or material derived from press releases. For any part you quote directly from a published bio, include quotation marks and a reference.

Pay particular attention to the way we make links to other Wikipedia  articles. Avoid WP:Peacock terms.

My question is don't you ever get tired of being dead wrong about so many things, so often, in such a needlessly nasty manner, and so publicly in front of your fellow editors? Vandals suck.  Eight year olds with access to the internet suck too.  But it's people like you who maintain a facade of respectability while being absolutely horrible to other people who are really the worst members of the Wikipedia community. -  """,0.14285714285714285

- does not provide an accessible overview
- does not have an acceptable degree of relative emphasis
- is overly redundant (in multiple instances, text is repeated verbatim later on)

Are all of these references really non-canonical?
Does a reference to a non-canonical book exist just because there is similar language?  Some of Paul's so-called references seem to be little more than his borrowing of a turn of phrase.  In at least one case, a supposedly non-canonical source seems canonical to me.  Chronicles refers to a """"book of Samuel, the seer"""" describing the deeds of King David.  Last I checked, there was a book in the bible accredited to Samuel, who was a seer, and that book was largely about the deeds of King David.  That got me wondering whether the book of Kings (like Chronicles and Samuel, usually published as two books in most modern bibles) records any of the other writings referenced in Chronicles.""",0.0

 Recent rename to Relationships between American Jewish religious movements 

I don't understand why this article renamed. All of the major movements involved  Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform  have both international histories and a contemporary international presence. The current article content does unduly reflect an American point of view, but this can be fixed. Best,  
I did this because, after reading the page over several times, it only had US denominational connection. True we might all be aware that each of the denominations has an international counterpart - but that isn't reflected on this page, by its creator or subsequent, numerous editors. Of course if this was not the proper thing to do, it can be changed back...but the whole page would need to be heavily added to. It is a shame this couldn't be purged entirely and a new section added to the denomination page. Best wishes,  

Agreeing with Shirahadasha, I don't think it makes sense to limit this article to American movements. Better to fix the content, because the geographic limit is quite artificial. For instance, what about Israeli Orthodox commenting on American movements, or vice versa? We certainly don't want to have this """"relationships"""" topic segmented for UK and Germany and Hungary, because movements and individuals  constantly interact and comment across geographic boundaries. We need to revisit the title.  | Talk 

Before we worry about the world-wide perspective - which I agree would be interesting - perhaps we should focus first on getting a well sourced WP:NPOV article on the USA.  There is a huge amount of material on the US alone to sort through.   

Several problems. (1) Many sources and notable figures do not limit their remarks to a geographic denomination. Hence, when R. Feinstein or Joel Roth comment on other movements, they don't refer only to Jews and organizations within the US. (2) Accordingly, the current article's content is not limited to the US. (3) The discourse of the movements cannot be segregated geographically enough to justify segregated articles. For these reasons, I will would like to move it back and open the discussion here. Thanks.  | Talk 

There is plenty of material available (e.g. historical, socialogical, literary) that is indeed region specific.  This article hasn't even begun to scratch the surface of that material.
Why is it relevant that Joel Roth says things that are worldwide? If claim A applies to US and claim A applies to Israel, then A is appropriate in any of the following three articles: (a) an article on the US (b) an article on israel and (c) an article on the US and israel.
The material on other areas (e.g. israel) is volumous - Israel deserves its own article.
If we write a good article on the US and then start writing one on Israel, and while writing the one on israel notice that we need to reuse material, then we can always add a third article with the shared material.
Even if we need shared material (e.g. for Israel and the US) it does not change the fact that both countries have denominational relationships that are complex enough and sufficiently sourced to each need their own article.
Finally, its better to do a little well, then try to do too much and do it poorly.   

(outdent) The following aspects of the article are not limited to internal USA relationships:
 Haredi views of Modern Orthodox, generally 
 R. Feinstein on non-Orthodox Jews
 Haredia on """"heretical intent and the 1800s widespread denigration of religion.""""
 Modern Ortho on non-Orthodox generally
 R. Soloveitchik  not discussing American non-Ortho alone
 R. Lamm saying """"non-Orthodox rabbis and laypeople may possess spiritual dignity"""" etc
 R. Berger: """"The Jewish loyalties and observances of non-Orthodox Jews are decidedly better than nothing."""" etc
 Conservative views of Orthodox are not limited to American Orthodox, and general view is held by Masorti/Conservative too
 R. Schorsch: """"claimed that Orthodox organizations in Israel politically discriminate against non-Orthodox Jews"""" obviously not US
 The Reform section is not only USA, mostly historical
Given this content, I would like to undo the recent move and switch the burden of proof for changing the name of this long-standing article. This can be done either as a BRD move or as a Requested Move. Thanks. [[U",0.0

Thanks Flyer22 that was not my guess.  Here's what the NBC website says, the official site, not a message board: Lucas was injured when a beam fell on his legs and EJ agreed to save Lucas only if Sami agrees to let EJ have his way with her. Sami reluctantly had sex with EJ and helped him escape to Mexico, after he was wanted in connection with the shooting of John Black. Despite Sami’s attempt to turn over a new leaf, EJ returned and pressed her for information on police activities, and she was pulled into another web of deception, trying to prevent him from learning she was pregnant. That's from Sami Brady.  That tells me the show's official position is that she agreed.  What a character says and what the show's position is in this case are not the same.  Since Ed Scott took over, only Lucas has used the word and Sami and EJ have shared a couple of kisses as well as reading the Santo and Colleen letters together. It has been indicated they are going to """"tighten things up"""" and fill in some wholes.

A couple of points

A. I don't think you're taking the Anonimu business too seriously, and I find Anittas' intervention rather bizarre, but the key is to keep watching and waiting, and acting when really ready. It's frustrating that he can get away with so much (and his attacks have been pointed out to a number of administrators so far).

B. I too despise the profusion of flags, especially when coupled with recentism. Take for instance a biography I was looking at today: that of Anna Politkovskaya. It starts out nicely, but once she gets shot, spirals quickly out of control. Maybe, just maybe, the assassination deserves its own article, but as for the main article, a serious, scholarly biography would never look like this, especially the """"political reaction"""" section.

C. By the way, here are the other """"international reactions"""" articles: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Some are just perhaps salvageable; with others, now that a few months have passed, """"who cares?"""" seems a more fitting reaction.  """,0.0

If it were censorship, all matter pretaining to the other languages usage in Malaysia would be removed. In fact, in the first paragragh, there are SEVEN ways how to call Malaysia in various languages and scripts.

 The official language box can only have Malay because Malay is the only official language. Unlike India, South Africa, or Canada or Singapore of which their constitutions say there are more than one official language, Malaysian constitution explicitly says only Malay is the official language. Thus - only Malay in the official language box. Wikipedia's job is to spread information, not make new information. See WP:NOR.

 For usual convention, see Template_talk:Infobox_Country. For general rule of thumb on naming, see Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English).

I can't believe you would use the argument about it being """"truer"""" to the original color with regard to the background, but not mention that awful black stuff around the edges (as if that's somehow """"truer"""" to the original).  I'm also curious as to what method you used to compare the sharpness, since I merely compared them side by side, and saw that in crispness, they're identical.  Again, yours is larger, but that's because I deliberately used a smaller image because the Fair Use Rationale requires that such images be no larger than (IIRC) 300px.  Yours is labeled 300px in the Fair Use Rational Template ts image page, but that label is incorrect, because right below the image it says that it's 400 x 600-something. We're lucky some other editor or bot hasn't come and tagged it as inappropriate because of that.  That's why I used a 300px image, so I wonder if that's what you're basing this on.  Anyway, I photoshopped your version to remove the blackness at the edges, and the green smudginess from the lower half of the image, to make it more """"gold"""".  I also credited you on th e page to which I uploaded this newest version. I hope that's a good compromise. Thing is, since it's a modification of your image, it's still more than 300px, so let's hope we don't get tagged for it.  If we do, we'll have to put an Image Reduction Request tag on it.   """,0.0
"Shell: the main page of RfC does not say anything about RfCs being the place to appeal administrators' abuse. Instead WP:BLOCK does say it is ANI where it belongs. No mention of RFC. 
Personally I am very sad that you insist in defending your wrong decission when it does so clearly breaks the rules. You have not even defended your decission (at least with minimal coherence) nor has done any other user/admin. 
I also find very sad that no other administrator has dared to intervene even when the case is so clearly a policy violation. I am offering an exit in good terms but as wikipedian I can't but follow the correct procedures outlined in the relevant policy pages and I hope that you do the same, because, as administrator you must abide to policy as much or even more than the common user.
I am getting more and more worried at the apparent arbitrarity displayed and what seems a fear of retaliation felt by some administrators. As compromised wikipedian I can't but fight that with the means that policy allows. It's not just my pride, my feelings or anything of the like: it is Wikipedia and Wikipedia's pillars what are at the stake.

 Radiocarbon dating 

Most writings on the DSS say they are mostly dated between 150 BCE and 70 CE. I see the section on radiocarbon dating here mostly falls in that general line (that is also used at the start of this article). I see that one radiocarbon dating cited here says they fall between 385 BCE to 82 CE with """"68%"""" reliability (not sure of the correct term used for this part of the dating). Does anyone know a lot about these dating methods? I'm guessing since the 150 BCE to 70 CE is the usual range always given, the 385 BCE is an outlier (as I've never heard any number going back beyond 200 BCE in anything I've read) not sure how this relates to the 68% number provided on that as well. Just wondered if anyone had any background info on that as it can be seen as contradictory (with the usual 150 BCE- 70 CE dating given everywhere else).  """,0.0

Maybe we can mention the city known Personals like Dr. Moghaisei, Dr. Maghsoodi, Dr. Babai, Dr. Sarreh, Dr. Kuchek, Dr. Daneshbachsh, the most powerful Mullah after the revolution, ...? 

Dear Alifalsafi,

I made those changes, and stand for them, because of the following:
 You don't need to put the literal meaning of """"Gorgan"""" when introducing it. """"The land of the wolf"""" comes later in the text.
 Astar-abad has nothing to do with """"star"""" as far as I know, if you have references for that please provide them in the text.
 Jasmin Tabatabai was not born in Gorgan and is not living there, so her father's properties, no matter how vast, doesn't make her a Gorgani.
 """"Marcel Kazemi, the known german-iranian Crown prince of Birjand born and living in Gorgan, was also the last german after the islamic revolution"""", this sentence is meaningless, if not ridiculous. what it means that he is the last German after the revolution?
 Neither Dr. Sahedi nor anyone else is called """"notable figure"""" because of owning three hospitals. If you want you can create a page like """"people from Gorgan"""" and put these guys there, but they can't sit beside As'ad Gorgani.
 """"Pahlavan-e Jahani Suchte Saray, world champion of wrestling"""", I couldn't honestly find his name anywhere else, if you have more information please write it in a new page and then link it to this page.
 What is """"Literature: Gorgan Nameh"""" ? Is that a news paper? Is that a book? Is that a literary book? Who has written it? Just throwing in a name is not, I suppose, of much use.

Let's make this page more informative and more clear.  

Dear Mtdashti, Salam Hamshahri?
Thanks for your explanation and opinion.
The Book """"Gorgan Nameh"""" written by Massihi and issued by Amir Kabir company I haven't here currently. It was renamed from 'Astarabad Nameh' to Gorgan Nameh.
The old edition I have has no ISBN no. Maybe there exists a new issue.
The different Names of Gorgan I have found in that book. These are correct. The meaning Astar resp. Sattar is setareh. There exists also a TV reportage and a book where all world cities with the name Starcity are listed on a line.
All the persons I named I known self. And so I know they were Gorgani. The famous Kazemis lived in the street Shahid Beheshti ,the known 'Masrahe Talaii' building, and also in district 'Gorgan Pars'. They had much credit and eminence in the whole city. The only european and western foreigner which lived in Gorgan still up to the end of the war. Marcel was born here and attend the schools 'Nahal Enghelabe Eslami' and 'Shahid Motahari'. I've seen him also in TV during the visit of Rafsandjani. They were also the only relatives of the Shah in the city.
The Tabatabi lived in Gorgan and was a Gorgani, so consequently his daughter is also a Gorgani. He was a very large man, very nice and helpful, had a bald head and weared a toupee.:) Had the same face as his daughter. His only land property was here in Gorgan.
Soochte Sarayi, I don't know how his name is written in english was a very known person but I can't find an english web page for him. Because he was in the era of the revolution a world champion no one from the young generation know him any more.
All the persons are dead and so I thing I can't write more about them. Dr. Sahedi was a very deserved man in Gorgan's medical society. He repaired even self the X-ray devices and enabled so the function of the hospitals during the war. He died thereafter due to radiation in Tehran. A plate commemorated on him in the portal of the hospitals.
What a pity I've forgotten the name of the most powerful only ruling Mullah of Gorgan. Maybe anybody else know it.
Maybe a list of the Mayors is also interesting for the future. 
If you want make the page more informative, we should set only a link to another topic with the famouse persons of the city? It would be better as a mix.
So it's better to delete and displace all persons with except of governor and current mayor?
Furthermore 'Torang Teppeh' is in samewise important like the Gorgan Wall. Are you the same mind?
Thanks a lot
 Choda hafez 

Dear Alifalsafi,

Thanks for your explanation. There is much to talk about. Of course these people that you named are (or were) important and known to Gorgani people, I agree with that, but here in this Wikipedia, we should mention people who are known in Iran, if not in the world. As'ad Gorgani is a renowned poet, known worldwide, we can't compare him with a kind helpful doctor who helped people: they are both important, but in different levels. I don't agree",0.0

Answere:- No I have not supported lotsd of groups. I have only supported the CPW , AWP (formally known as the NCPA). I was never a member of the People's Think Tank Association plus the PTTA never had a president. Plus I have only ever been one person. And that person is Peter Watson. This nazi must have a lot of time on his hands to look for information on me. So I can only come up with only one conclusion and that is simply that this man has no social or sex life. So I can only say on thing """"go get a life man and get a women"""".

Peter was President of the """"People's Think Tank Association"""" based in Warwick, which he says """"split from the Communist Party of Australia just recently and they publish the Caller""""

Answere:- I was never the president of the PTTA. The PTTA was never ever created. The Caller was a fake news paper. As fare as I know it was only ever printed once by some nazi. Since the PTTA was never realy so how cna it split from the CPA. So many questions and not enough answeres. The man just doesn't have a life.

Peter was """"President of the New Communist Party of Australia"""" and """"Chairman of the Central Committee"""" (this is in his Communist International News)

Answere:- I was the president but not the had of the NCPA. I was the chairman of the central commitee. But as you might know the NCPA and the AWP are the same group. The AWP change its name to NCPA but change it's name back soon after remember you stupid nazi.

Peter was """"President of the Communist Party of Warwick""""

Answere:- Only for a short number of times in the hsitory fot he party that I was the presidnet of it.

Peter also says: """"the New Communist Party of Australia (NCPA) , The People Think Tank Association (PTTA) and the Communist Socialist Workers Front (CSWF) did dissolve and absorbed into the Australia First Party (AFP)"""".

Answere:- The Communist Socialist Worker's Front never ever was created and never was real. It just goes to show that nazis just makes things up to help them selvs. The PTTA was never real. If you are aksing why I made the CSWF and the PTTA up well it was just for fun.

Peter has also set up the """"Australian Worker's Party""""

Answere:- This nazi (FairDinkum) is a idiot. I have said this many times that it was started in april was a split from the CPW that changed it's name to NCPA than change it's name back to AWP when it was kicked out fo the AFP. Not only are nazis stupid like FairDinkum but they also don't listen.

I am a Communist and believe in Marxist-Leninism. I am not retarted. Plus I am not troubled person or retarted. I have never said in my life that I was the king of the Communists or the Nazis.

"Disruptive edits 

Hello, . Despite 's statement, you have not so far been reported at WP:Administrator intervention against vandalism as far as I can see; but if you continue your disruptive editing you will be. Looking at your edits, I get that you have strong opinions about John de Ruiter. While I know nothing of him, I have some sympathy with your position. But you are going about your campaign in a way that is disruptive to Wikipedia, and you need to stop.
First, as you have already been told, you introduced material (and, in particular, critical material) into a biography of a living person without giving any references to a published source which supports your material. This is absolutely forbidden, but the first time you did it our policy of assuming good faith should lead any other editor to just remove your additions and explain to you that this is not acceptable; and this is what happened.
What you are encouraged to do at that point, is to discuss the matter on the talk page Talk:John de Ruiter, and try to reach agreement with other editors; if you are unable to do so, our dispute resolution procedure would tell you how to proceed.
What you did do, is to insert your unsupported material again. This is called edit warring, and is a quick way to get yourself blocked from Wikipedia.

Assuming that you are in good faith (i.e. that you think the de Ruiter article is unbalanced), your best bet is to start by finding some reliable published sources which are critical of him (not blogs or forums, but material from reputable publishers). If you can find some, then you may edit the article to add only what is supported by the sources you have found (though in view of your recent history, even in this case you should probably start by discussing it on the talk page). If you cannot find such sources, then I'm afraid you must not edit the page further. Unsupported material and original research are not permitted in Wikipedia articles.

I suspect that you believe that it is important to expose something you think is not right about how de Ruiter presents himself. If that is that case, I'm afraid that Wikipedia is not a soapbox, and you may not use it in that way.",0.0

Wow!  I just saw tonight's news article on Wikipedia that played on FOX News.  (Earlier, I'd posted here the AP article on Wikipedia from Dec 12, 2005.)

In what has become a huge coincidence, the very day the media begins reporting on the dangers of Wikipedia, happens to be the day immediately after the very week I discovered misinformation and falsehoods being posted on this page about nitrites, and then tried to edit them by attempting to add more accurate information, but then was attacked and harassed by another person who disagrees with my edits  and was ultimately blocked and threatened by a purported Wikipedia administrator.

As was reported in the news today, people can go to http://www.wikipedia-watch.org/ to learn more about how Wikipedia functions, and where the dangers exist.

The folks at wikipediawatch report that, what's happening in Wikipedia, is that any collection of citations that may APPEAR balanced is all that anybody expects. If the title or snippet in a link itself contributes to this impression, then the full text is not researched by anyone.

This is exactly what has been going on in this nitrite page.  As a result, it truly is, as wikipediawatch reminds us, """"garbage in, garbage out, garbage back in...""""  and after a few cycles of this, it all turns into """" a big, stinking heap"""".

Truly, as the news media warned today: """"Don't believe eveyrthing you read on the Web, especially on Wikipedia!""""

The following two posts, found in a wikipediareview blog, sum up my experiences this past week, after having been harassed, threatened and finally blocked, after I attempted to add to the body of knowledge about nitrites/poppers.  They demonstrate how dangerous Wikipedia  based on its current model  really is:

""""Wikipedia's procedural faults, complete anarchy as regards contributions, and sometimes-bizzare social rules do not teach people to become good researchers or writers... it teaches them how to be good Wikipedians, or to get the hell out."""" - Jason Scott
"""". . . when it comes to history and politics, Wikipedia can claim whatever it wants by shutting out those who actually know something about a certain topic. In that way, Wikipedia can rewrite history as it sees fit - which may have nothing to do with reality or the actual facts."""" - SummerFR

Finally, this post on a board, discussing wikipedia, really sets it out well:

""""Any moron can pretty well say anything they want on any topic, which is fine for a News Group or a Forum but not an Encyclopedia.

In my opinion a reference source should be authoritative enough to end arguments not start them.

I believe that Wikipedia could better serve the internet community if they checked their facts first before publishing the article.

Instead, we have a situation where the cart is placed before the horse and we end up with what is left by the horse.""""

 The precise definition of race is under dispute 

I wrote this to help spread understanding, please make sure to read the definitions of outcrossing on the link.

There is a lot of misunderstanding of genetics and further there is a lot of misinformation that people spread because they WANT you to think that there is no difference between peoples for a political or social agenda, that does not make it so. Humans share 98% of our genetic code with Chimpanzees, yet that 2% defines our differences and is important as is the difference in the human population, no matter how small the difference.

There are obviously differences in the expressed traits between Asian, African and Caucasian. These are different types of humans, if you choose to call the a race/breed or type it's up to you and it's immaterial. My argument has always been that racial diversity should be preserved which is a more neutral position rather than promoting that race mixing and interbreeding is somehow positive.

You and many people that listen to pop culture may think that by interbreeding you are helping humanity and there are lots of myths about how you will create better offspring; offspring that have the best of both parents. This is just a myth told by people who, are trying to say that people are equal, if different. Yes, people are people as Americans we believe that all people have certain inalienable rights but the best position for humanity is for each of the races to exist, separately to be the best we can. If you truly understand the advantages that diversity offers you will agree too.

I personally breed horses. And this is where I'll start telling you a story: the Thoroughbred horse started out as a mixed race horse. It was based on Arab stock and was bred only for speed for many generations, regardless of breed, the horse that ran the race the fastest was bred to other fast horses. The Thoroughbred breeding book is now closed, which means you cannot breed a Thoroughbred to any other breed, because, ANY cross you make outside of the gene pool will reduce the speed of the horse. This is called line breeding, please read this article as a basic """"learn to breed"""" guideline: http://www.learntobreed.com/linebreeding.html. Line breeding(inbreeding) is a useful technique as is outcrossing when advantagous to produce quality results, random mixing is like a child finger-painting and does nothing positive.

What Wikipedia has been proposing is that random interbreeding is potentially a good idea and should be treated as potentially positive. Any person who knows about breeding animals will disagree, it's very unlikely that race mixing will result in a positive result unless it was planned for by a geneticist. When you cited the plant hybridization, that's what you were doing citing a hybrid that was designed in a laboratory and there were not human beings or living animals as a result of a genetic mistake. You can't through bad human crosses in the trash like you can with corn.""",0.0

I won't comment further on the book, as I think my comments below are sufficient.
Regarding the Web sites, I would note that there seems to be very few Web sites on Plasma Cosmology / Plasma Universe (unlike sites on Big Bang cosmology), and I think that is worth taking into account.
plasmacosmology.net
... appears to be generally OK to me. I see obvious areas of contention, with section on the Electric Universe, Ancient Testimony, and Speculations. But these pages are separate and obvious, and do not seem to """"pass off"""" the more speculative material as if it were pure Plasma Cosmology.
... the site certainly isn't peer reviewed, and it is unlikely to have been produced by an """"authority""""... the Contact page says """"Independent Researcher""""
... The site more closely resembles a """"blog"""" since it appears to be produced by one person, but that is not grounds for automatic dismissal. We already include a page from the Web site of Ned Wright,, and while he is obviously an authority on Big Bang cosmology, I would argue that he is not an authority on Plasma Cosmology. Nevertheless, I am sure he points out some errors in Eric Lerner's work, and I am sure that Lerner has pointed out misunderstandings in Wright's. Either way, there seems to be value in Wright and Lerner's pages (irrespective of whether we agree with their points of view). Likewsise, I think there is value in plasmacosmology.net, even though there may be disagreements with parts of it.
thunderbolts.info
I must declare a potential conflict of interest with the site, as I am shown as a contributor,, so I will refrain from commenting more, unless you specifically ask me to do so, now knowing the connection.

 Re Central Asian SHepherd dog

And I know wilki does not care about someone personal criminal history.

But I tried to reason with this person who uses wilki to promote and excuse dog fighting as a test.. I asked for references in English and none can be provided.

I provided a New York Times reference and that is removed because it proves it is a blood sport running amock in Russia excused as a test.

I do not make a living off a breeding dogs . But I wish to protect the breed from breed specific legislation. This wrong missleading information posted here does REAL life harm to the breed.

The Russian have created as per more ref a new fighting breed.

Please if you insist on working with this editor while I spend time rescueing all the dogs she forgets in shelters. I cant do all the rescues and stay here fulltime, and care for my farm and dogs. 

So pls i beg youn change the name from CAS to CAO and have her ruin the breed under its russian version name . Allow me to try to save the breed from future bsl.

Maybe if a non competive type person posts , maybe then this would be settled.
So I will contact the writer of link that is being hidden from all , cause it proves the information about the 'test"""" is false.

I wonder if I searched the history of those 12 articles, would I find that either TallMagic or his partner admin Orlady have added that phrase """"operating illegally"""" to Wikipedia, and whether the source will be cited, and if so, will it be a mainstream media report that asserts the importance, or whether it will be an Archive.org snapshot of this purportedly infallible Oregon state website?

"Honestly the way wiki is treating this is a JOKE

a. I could have cited NEWS SITES but since when is a news site worthy of an academic cite?

b. if the person that wanted PEER REVIEW felt like it, he would have sought it 20 years ago, HE CHOSE NOT TO DO IT, but none the less his work is known and was mentioned in many math related 'forums' and most ignored it. 

c. Only the recent 2012 open source test of the work PROVED the 30Mod algorithm is a major thing in math, again, GITHUB is a programmers resource and it was not until a computer used the actual 30Mod algorithm that it was shown to be a 'big thing' and since then some news sites have covered it, but I chose not to cite them due to IMO they are not NPOV. But none the less they covered the story.

d. The FACT is a major computer site where programmers have free reign to challenge any claims exists and for over two years not one programmer challenged the findings.

e. so what if the person that discovered it works outside of academia and has no regard for normal 'peer review' the fact is he has no peers if you ask some in academia that know of his work, and I am one of those people that know of the work and how brilliant the work is.

Now to summarize, we have a bunch of pags about primes on wiki, and even pages created after his discovery that USE his discovery (ie. the sieve of Atkin 60Mod work is his work discussed in the public forum and usenet math and physics forums is where he chose to discuss his amazing work.

So now you have 2004 sieve of Atkin using a 60Mod algorithm, guess what that was in his 1995 paper. So does wiki acknowledge that? No. And i didn't even bother to waste my time of the 60 mod algorithm since the big deal as you are saying is the PyPrimes test and I cited that very well, it's a program created in Python, I cited the wiki python page, then I cited Github for both PyPrimes and the PyPrimes testing.

Now while MATH is m forte, I am sufficient enough in computer skills to understand what Github is and to understand how to read the speed tests and the prime spirals smoked every algorithm there is. Now anyone can download python (which I have done) and download pyprimes (which I have done) and run the tests. Guess what just like a math experiment, it is duplicated.

So GITHUB and the tests which are not 'new' should be enough to begin a wiki page on this truly amazing discovery in math.

I myself became aware of the first paper in 1995, as did others in aademia. Recently I became aware of 'news sites' running stories citing what I copied, the links to the Github tests.

While some here can say well it's not AMA, so what, in the world of primality testing primes spirals as per the PyPrimes results shows PRIME SPIRALS are a big deal.

Now I tried to be NPOV in giving all sides of the story, Adoni has a valid 1995 claim I can verify it and I chose not to. But I cited a Drexel Math forum and I could have cited many other math sites discussing his 30mod, 60mod and 90mod prime work in the 1990's. Is this signficant? You bet it is since 60Mod prime sieve aka Atkin sieve is 20004 so his 60mod prime work is well before it.

Now the Github tests mentions 'croft spirals', that's due to in 2010 a person named croft registering a web site and ripping off the 1995 work. MY OPINION.

Now Croft can say all he wants that he found it playng his guitar or whatever he is claiming.

The fact is anyone can document Adoni with Prime theory from the 1990's saying 30mod, 60mod and 90mod is the key.

9 Years later sieve of atkin appears, well that's only a rehash of the adoni 60mod work from the 1990's. Yet no one is giving him credit.

2010 croft puts out his 30Mod work and its inserted into PyPrimes on Github and it smokes every major prime algorithm there is and all of them have pages on wiki as I cited.

So 2012 a work on Github verifies how important to primality the 30mod spirals are, but he says croft spirals, well guess what HelixQ is now out there and taking 100% credit for the 1995 work of Dr. Adoni.

My site to a Drexel math site from the 1990's mentioning 30Mod prime work (prime spirals) is a major cite, since Adoni could care less about the AMA or whatever, in all probability he will soon be nominated for a Nobel on his work, that is how important it is. 

Think about it, not one prime algorithm could beat the ancient sieve of Eratosthenes, none of them. On a computer creating primes all other algorithms are terribly slow. The only two fast generators from scratch are the ancient sieve of Eratosthenes and the PRIME SPIRALS, and the winner was Prime Spirals. Now I can cite recent news articles about it, laughing at academics it links to that said it was no big deal in the 1990's who now all look foolish due",0.14285714285714285

The Cherokee comment was a concern because JVM stated, as if it were established fact, that the person he was talking about had attempted witness tampering, extortion, and solicitation of murder.  That's libel if it's not true.  Yet the claim doesn't square with the fact that the person was never charged on such grounds, and the drug charges were eventually dismissed.  I don't think murder-for-hire, extortion, or witness tampering would be treated so lightly by federal and state prosecutors; in one sentence JVM claims that the plot was uncovered during the trial and just a couple of diffs later he claims that he was involved in arranging a deal resulting in only a permanent injunction against selling peyote.  Can you blame me if I find this farfetched?  Aren't such falsehoods disruptive to WP?

Your comment that his edits related to LDS articles are """"no more POV than the average LDS editor's contributions"""" is mind-boggling to me.  Your opinion of LDS people must be very poor indeed if that's the case, and it makes me wonder if I'm not swimming upstream here in trying to raise concerns about JVM.

Hey there, I am new to wikipedia but am quickly getting a hang of things. I noticed that not only are you a very active user but that your comments and edits are very professional, I want to thank you for this.

I have been taking a lot of time recently to ensure that the Deuce page has enough information and is kept up to date. As the producer / lead singer for Hollywood Undead and embarking on his own solo career (new interview / blog posted that confirms this) I do not believe this page should be deleted. As a fan of Hollywood Undead my self, myself and many of my other friends have been using this page as a reliable source to find out what tracks he has been producing and other artists he is working with.

I tried to """"vote"""" to not get the page deleted but was hoping you could give me some advice to make this page more relevant and important so that fans can stay updated and get the information that is needed and wanted by them. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.""",0.0

Still The Achilles' Heel of Wikipedia.

Maybe someone who checks in on this talk page might now where to go with it?

First, a public reply to Dragons flight, (and maybe his own sockpuppet """"Freestylefrappe""""):  Hardly a """"sockpuppet"""" when I used the very same name....  followed by a """"2"""".  Or are you talking about blocking Pgio """"too"""", who simply agreed that someone here is quite a J_rk?  I asked so clearly that you wouldn't take away WMC's opportunity to block me himself....  I would have been proud.  But you knew that too, right?

Wikipedians: I freely admit, that my own level of civility here has lowered....  even against my own admonishment to others to avoid such behavior.  All I can say, is that it is a VERY difficult dynamic to avoid when some here play by such despicably manipulative and base rules of engagement.  I'm thinking of that dichotomy between people who claim that their Ends or so worthy, that they should get a pass on their occasional stray from acceptable means, vs. those who retain some hold on the idea that they will be judged by their Means, no matter the final outcome.

This is made all the more difficult where users such as Admin WMC, who know full well the self imposed limits of their opponents, demand verbal civility on one hand, and yet play such extensive games of """"pretend to forget"""", """"I didn't see that"""" written ten times before, and ALWAYS selectively choose the lowest hanging fruit in a nest of specific challenges to their type of behavior, contributions, and edits.  

Worldly people understand the sensitive nature of situations like these.  Educated people (especially those through the School of Hard Knocks) know that these situations are more often set-ups, initiated by the manipulator.  The manipulator has at least learned the fine art of camouflage where they can hide very well 'in plain sight' flying the banner of Democracy.  Failing to acknowledge this simple possibility, marks one as either the manipulator, or just a pseudo-intellect.

As I've said before, and will say again....   If users like WMC were genuine, they'd acknowledge human fallibility and the basic rights of dissident opinion.  Doing so, WMC would quickly gain my support of his presentations on mainstream understanding.  He gets that part right VERY OFTEN and has demonstrated a tenacity to seeing his POV upheld.  Good for him, and why I have absolutely no trouble with his dominance over others trying to write articles presenting such information.  Yet why?  Why does he refuse to acknowledge his lack of verse in material outside of his very public field of knowledge?  Why does he go so far in his chilling drive to stifle the good faith presentations of non-mainstream fields?  

Please, I'm not just talking about aether theories alone.  The electric fields have plenty to say about corollary/causal dynamics in cogent presentations about a very possible relationship to atmospheric phenomenon.  Damn if WMC shouldn't be reading some of that stuff instead of JUST pointing out how it's counter to the formulas used in current Climate Models.  I mean, just forget about the LONG history of trial and repeated errors in aether postulation, the mysteries of electricity still surround us and we would all benefit by keeping an open mind about that.  

In the least, do we really think it wise to insist by near constant omission, any possibility that Birkeland or Alfvén currents effect our conductive atmosphere.  I'm not saying that WMC's models need to be trashed or even that he should modify them this afternoon, but it's highly suspicious that he suppresses the postulations and formulations from even the notable sources working on competitive modeling.  It is so suspicious, that is why I question his objectivity, and point out that he IS a PAID agent of tax dollars vested in a particular model. That he doesn't acknowledge and recuse himself, is just annoying to say the least.  That Wikipedia doesn't impose some boundaries on this user's blinding conflict of interest, casts a far greater doubt upon Wikipedia NPOV all together.  """,0.0

I agree with you here WMC.  The net of his contributions are a positive but his attitude and belief that everything he thinks is right no matter what others think is taxing.

Both acts share a common legal history, although they may be treated differently under modern legal systems.

The two paragraphs about the Christian allegorical theme about love and the two brides being based on two meanings of love, which relate to the latin words """"amor"""" and """"veritas"""" seems contradictory to the fact that the story is, apparently based, on a """"Russian-Jewish folktale.""""

Although the Christian/Jewish contradiction may be attributed to the relationship between the two religions, the fact that the entire thing is made clear by the fact that the meanings of love """"come out better in Latin"""" raises a few red flags for me. Hell, Russian isn't even a Romance language.

On top of all that, I can find no evidence that Theophile Guerin ever existed, or his 1836 book about a monk and a dead woman.

It's very interesting as an idea, but since this information of Guerin is given rather than a citation, I say that the entire two paragraphs should be IMMEDIATELY deleted.

However, I've already spent too much time writing all this and researching that, and am too unsure to actually delete it.

If i get around to rechecking this discussion and no one has said anything or disagreed, I will edit the entry, as there is no citation and it seems unfactual and invented  fictional.

 Article in need of improvement 

A substantial part of the article,

The article would clearly benefit by having it pointed out that, although it could be, the experiment has as yet not been performed. In its original form the idea is to have a tunnel dug through the Earth so that a test object (""""cannonball"""") can be dropped into it. This is, of course, impossible. But the same physical principles would be revealed by using laboratory-sized massive bodies instead. The experiment could be performed in an Earth-based laboratory or in an orbiting satellite.

hi Regarding deleteing this article as being not notable. Hi Regarding deleting this article as being not notable. the company was founded in 1824 and was an important ant horn comb manufacturer before the advent of plastics  it exported combs from England to America and the company was then very well known an ordinary thing like a comb used to be expensive as it was made of horn. The company Stockley and Wakelin does not trade any more so there is no commercial pourpose. There is another delete tag that that the article violates copyright as the material is elsewhere on the net. There is no copyright violation as the text elsewhere on the internet is my own. I am selling a Comb from made by Stokely and Wakelin on e bay and decided to do a write-up on Stockely and wakely - The comb is being sold for six pounds - so my intention to write the article on the company could hardly be for the purpose of flogging the one ccomb. Rather a comb was and is an important article of everyday use. There are no articles on horn combs which were used before plastics on Wikipedia and I was only trying to fill a gap by writing a article and improving on horn combs about what we used before plastics. Any way the article can be undeleted so that I and other wikipedians may improve on it and contribute to the knowledge of horn combs.",0.0

You *ARE* indeed clueless. Yes, """"Ariana"""" is a different spelling for """"Aryana"""" which does indeed come from the Avestan's """"Aryanem Vaejo"""" (specifically, in Vandidad, Fargasht-e Yekom).  But the """"Aria"""" that you mention above is Greek for what is in Old Persian """"Haraiva"""" which is modern Herat (Hari-Rud).  Looks like you can't even read and understand a simple text in front of you.  The Greek """"Aria"""" has NOTHING TO DO with """"Arianem Vaejo"""".  Not even a single scholar has ever suggested that Arianem Vaejo is the same as """"Haraivo or the Greek """"Aria"""".  The Greek """"Aria"""" for Avestan/Old Persian """"Haraivo"""" is comparable to how in ancient greek text Hagmatana is written """"Ekbatana"""" or many other examples. The Old Persian satapry Hari-Rud (which was not called Hari-Rud in Old Persian) is clearly mentioned in both Darius I's Behistun Inscription as well as two of Xerxes' inscriptions.  """"Arianem Vaejo"""" on the other hand, is mentioned in the Avesta where I told you above, and numerous scholars have published works on the whereabouts of it (including our own late Dr. Bahram Farahvashi who has a full book by that title, called """"Iran Vij"""").  Nobody (other than our great scholar """"Zereshk"""" of course) thinks it is the same as Hari-Rud/Haraivo/greek """"Aria"""".  

As for """"aberoo"""", I honestly feel sad for you, because your beahviour and edits in Wikipedia clearly reveal that you suffer from an inferiority complex and nearly all your edits are about image and not about contents.  It is obvious that you try to present an image instead of contributing to contents.

Just so you know jerk, my child attends the school """"Institution of Discipline Taught Through the Beatings of Dexter Day"""" and it is closed-minded people like you that will not give homosexuals the right to be beaten when they deserve it most. My son is a flaming homosexual, and every now and then he goes over the top and needs to be beaten with a blunt, heavy object. To tell you the truth, you yourself should be attacked by a pack of savage wolverines (That is Recess on Tuesdays). Now good day to you, and please change the information back to what I had it.""",0.0
"warnings????!?!?! 

I have numerous warnings from you about vandilization and me being homophobic??????  I have NEVER written anything in wikipedia, why does it say that I have done all these horrible things????  I can't believe that someone would insult me on a personal level just because they assume I have done something;  I am deeply hurt that you would call me homophobic- my college education is in defending people from discrimination, why on earth would i discriminate against anyone?  I would also never think of vandalizing the site, i didn't even know i could delete or rewrite things on here!

"""

 Article contains too much incorrect information 

I'm going to rewrite large portions of this article some time soon because the authors who wrote them don't understand what ad hominem means.  If there are any objections to this, please voice them here.  There is a very common misconception going around, that ad hominem is simply an attack against the person you're arguing with, but that is not necessarily the case.  Likewise, an 'attack' doesn't have to be name-calling or anything like that.  It could simply be something like """"you are wrong because you don't have a PhD in the subject.""""

There is a very important distinction that some, but not all parts of the article make between to types of attacks.
Ad hominem attack:  """"Your argument is wrong because of [something about the person they are arguing with].""""
""""That piece of evidence may be true, but how could you possibly be right, you don't have any kind of degree or certification in this area.""""
""""There's no way he could be right about this area of quantum physics, the guy dances around naked in his house!""""

Non-ad hominem attack: """"You're such a(n) [disparaging remark].  You are wrong because of [insert reasoning unrelated to the person].""""
""""These statistics from this highly credible polling agency clearly show that you're wrong about the prevelance of it.  Why am I even arguing with this idiot?  I should really learn to stop arguing with someone who couldn't even get a GED.""""
""""That's it, you're too stupid to argue with, bye.""""
""""Here's a comprehensive study showing why you're wrong.  In the future I suggest that you take some courses in this before arguing about it.""""

See the distinction?  If there's any confusion, I can clarify further.

Please note that there is an exception of sorts, if the person you're arguing with IS the subject of the argument, then you can attack the characteristics of the person which are relevent to the argument.  Although I'm not sure if that's really an exception or just not considered ad hominem to begin with.  It depends if you define ad hominem as """"attacking the person as a basis for your argument"""" OR """"attacking the persno as a basis for your argument in place of attacking their argument.""""  The latter definition has the exception built-in, since you'd be attacking the person in addition to (not in place of) their argument.

 WTF?! want != need 

Obviously, the idiot that wrote """"the need for instant gratification"""" failed economics 101. A need is something you must have for survival; that isn't instant gratification. A want is something that you would like to have but can live without.

The guy that edited this is probably a consumerist moron with thousands in credit card debt. Debtors are fools that shouldn't be allowed to own anything. This is why a fully market economy can't end poverty. Only those with a proper education should be allowed to participate in a market economy. Fools that don't know the difference between a want and a need should be owned by their employer. Their employer can better determine what they need than themselves. Poverty would be eliminated by this mix of a command and market economies. The remaining unemployed, fat, and lazy fools can go to jail.

After 10 days the discussion was still very much active and no warning was given of deletion, or consideration of the fact that I requested mediation to resolve serious questions pertaining to bias and bad-faith.  Also, during deletion review I have shown that it is doubtful that the closing admin even read the AFD arguments properly and probably wasn't even aware that mediation had been requested.  This admin says there was clear consensus but the fact is that it was claerly shown during AFD that the advocates for deletion could not motivate their own statements, instead chosing to default anyway with """"Delete"""" endorsements.  I am told that the onus of proof lies on me yet I have addressed every single criticism repeatedly whereas they could not and did not submit proof for their own statements.  Also there were many supporters who presented arguments for 'keep' (probably outweighing the number who wanted 'delete') but these arguments were never addressed and the guys at deletion review are telling me that these contributions have zero weight because the people who want to 'keep' are all first-time users.  Deletion review is also proving unhelpful and in my opinion also biased with nobody seriously considering the arguments that have been raised, or really prepared to read through the AFD discussion properly.  I have no idea of what to do next and in fact if anything can be done.  I am extremely disillusioned with this process as it is obvious that prejudgements and lots of Wiki-speak are employed to 'prove' unsuitability, rather than arguments being actually objectively considered.

This poorly written Wiki article attempts to make it appear that ancient Macedonians were distinct from ancient Greeks. I would gambit the article is largely edited by people from Fyrom/Republic of Macedonia with irredentist aims towards Greece (contrary to both US and UN resolutions to refrain from propaganda against Greek Macedonians). Despite the occasional voice of objections there is no major dispute among most scholars that ancient Macedon was inherently Greek in nature. (at least more than anything else) The Hellenic age (the greek word for what we in english call """"greek"""") is evidence beyond dispute of this.

 To give an example of historical distortions found in this article...

""""Macedon or Macedonia (Greek Μακεδονία Makedonía) was the name of a kingdom centered in the northern-most part of ancient Greece, bordered by the kingdom of Epirus to the west and the region of Thrace to the east.""""

By saying the """"northern-most part of Greece"""" it makes it seem like it bordered Greece. There was no """"Greece"""" state in ancient times... there was only a collection of autonomous city states and Kingdoms that self-identified as Greeks. (Mycenae, Athens, Argos, Ithica, Sparta, Macedon Corinth, etc...) 

Another example of irredentism.... the wiki article states....

""""It became increasingly Atticised during this period, though prominent Athenians appear to have regarded the Macedonians as uncouth[3].

 This statement is very deceptive. It was common during times of conflict for Greeks to label each other """"barbarians"""" (non-greeks) as an insult. (similar to saying """"unAmerican"""" today) 

 While Demosthenes used """"barbarians"""" to describe Macedonians... he also used it describe the Athenean orator Aristogeiton [Aristophanes, ‘Nephelae’ (line 491). And even Demosthenes himself as described by as a """"barbarian"""" by Aeschine. Plato characterized the Lesbian Aeolic Greek dialect as ‘a barbarian register’ while addressing Pittakos of Mytilene. Athenaios VIII 350a  Socrates calls Strepsiadis “ανθρωπός αμαθές ουτώσι και βάρβαρος“.  (Strepsiadis…was a well-known Athenian) - Protagoras 3410 etc... etc... There are countless instances of Greeks describing each other as barbarians.

  There are other examples of bias in the article but the most telling is how it lightly brushs over the Hellenic period of Macedon (similiar to the golden age of Athens).... in which Macedonia spread the Greek Language, Greek culture, and Greek ideas to the region. They unique flavour of macedon among Greeks... was very similar to how Athens also had unique aspects to it... as did Sparta... as did most of the Greek mini-states.

 If Macedon wasn't Greek.... then Greek philosopher Aristotle wasn't Greek either (since he came from Chalcidice in Macedon). To go down this road we would also need to rewrite a fair portion of Wiki articles related to antiquity and the Hellenistic period. To do this to suit the political needs of a country whose population is roughly a quarter Muslim and most of the rest are ethnically slavic (who have called themselves Yugoslavians, Serbians, and Bulgarians in the last hundred years) amounts to roughly helping the Taliban blow up Buddhist statues for political ends. 

 Because of political nature of the article I would advise a complete rewrite by people will credentials in ancient studies. History is not a popularity contest. Just stick to the facts as we know them.  What's ironic is that virtually every last piece of """"evidence"""" that Macedon wasn't Greek... is either translated from Greek or comes from Greek artifacts. The citizens of Fyrom can't even read inscriptions from Macedon... as they are almost all writen in Greek.

Ethnologue version 14 (valid from 2000 to 2005) contains different information from Ethnologue version 15 (from 2005 onwards). Any person qualified to write on Greece would know that there was no census in Greece in 1986 (they happen every 10 years so the nearest ones were 1981 and 1991) and that the last time """"mother tongue"""" and """"most frequently used language"""" were asked in a Greek census was 1951. The number for the """"mother tongue"""" question (the other number for frequently used language was even smaller) did make it into Ethnologue v.14 but Ethnologue v.15 for reasons that can only be guessed (pretty easily I may add) chose to come up with a fake census and a figure in the 200k region. Anyone that has enough brains to pass a thesis examination for a Ph.D. (as Taivo has) is capable of looking at the differences between Ethnologue v.14 and Ethnologue v.15 and noticing suspicious changes based on sources dated before 2005. A clear example is in Arvanitika: v14 claims (correctly - I wish I knew how many speakers there were left) a range between 50,000 (Newmark) to 140,000 possible speakers (1977 Trudgill and Tzavaras). v15 comes up with 150,000 (2000) without a clear attribution (what happened in 2000) or an explanation of how a language in clear decline increased in numbers. Moreover v15 creates a new category of 10k speakers of Tosk Albanian for the region of Epirus; this is now separate from Arvanitika despite the fact that the page on Arvanitika still includes the reference to a Northwestern Arvanitika dialect from v14 that could only have referred to the region of Epirus. There is a clear inference (from the text as well) that the inclusion of this new category is related to the political issue of the Cham expulsion (and the claims about """"Orthodox Chams""""). Finally the very concept of what these numbers mean is in doubt. The north of the village of Andros is mentioned for Arvanitika: bilingualism in our families ended with our grandparent's generation. Extremely few among our parent's generation could converse in Arvanitika - the rest retained a few words or curses and our generation still has those (if at all). To portray the area as Arvanitika speaking is so misleading that it can only be done on purpose.

There are published books (in Greece - by leftist Greek journalists and amateur historians) that refer to figures around 200k (or even more for that matter) for Slavomacedonian speakers in Greece (again based on some dubious definition); large agenda-driven figures can also be found for Vlachs and Arvanites - since FPS, Taivo and Jim62sch and the rest of the gang are such experts on Greece I leave it as an exercise to them to locate these sources and at least put a fig leaf on. Until then use of non-existent census figure in Ethnologue makes a mockery of the academic standards they so passionately purport to be trying to uphold.""",0.0

ONIH has not addressed the issue, and he has also not answered my question.  

1. I said small would be more appropriate relative to """"minor"""" - """"""""Minor"""" reflects a point of view. """"Small"""" would be more appropriate.""""  Most appropriate would be to not have any modifier.  If the split was so minor, why are so many people still ticked off about it?  And it's not fair to say that the RSF folks left the movement, they just continued pursuing a direction they had pursued for years.  The """"movement"""" is bigger than PSF and PIRA.

2. I did not state that Peter Taylor is a """"mere journalist.""""  If I did, my apologies to Peter Taylor.  Indeed, please point it out where I used the phrase """"mere journalist."""" 

I did state that he has written some excellent books.  For better or worse, historians are not journalists.  They have different schools for each, in fact.  Provos accompanied a documentary broadcast; it's a great publication, but it's not a detailed history of the Provisional IRA.  The wikiepedia entry for Peter Taylor states, """"Peter Taylor born Scarborough, North Yorkshire is a British journalist and documentary-maker who had covered for many years the political and armed conflict in Northern Ireland, the so-called Troubles. From his experience he has written and produced books and television documentaries on the Northern Irish conflict.""""  The entry for J. Bowyer Bell states, """"The Troubles began in Northern Ireland in 1969, and Bell's The Secret Army: the IRA 1916-1970 was published the following year, and was one of the first detailed histories of the IRA along with The IRA by Tim Pat Coogan which was also published in 1970.""""  Many of the people that Taylor interviewed were also interviewed by Bell; and Bell probably interviewed them first and, in some cases, more than once (though Taylor probably interviewed several people multiple times, too).  

3. One Night In Hackney states above that he """" wasn't using one source over another, I was using what the source actually said.""""  But Bell clearly states, as noted above, """"Ruairi O Bradaigh, Daithi O Conaill, and about one hundred others walked out to form Republican Sinn Fein.""""  So, the sources disagree.  At one point, I believe, the word """"twenty"""" was in there.  It is not in there now, and from my view this is appropriate.  If the sources disagree we should not choose one over the other, but instead we should either acknowledge the differences and quote from each or find a way to be neutral  not quoting from either.

4. Once again there has been a dispute in which One Night in Hackney has chosen one source over another and then when confronted with a direct quotation from an alternate source he has chosen to ask questions, change the subject, and deny the validity of the source.  The reality is that Taylor and Bell are both valid sources, and Bell was clearly talking about people walking out of the Ard-Fheis.  Bell might have been wrong, Taylor might be wrong, but we as Wikipedia editors are not in a position to make that determination.  To do so is to engage in Original Research. WH.

 Infobox cast list/billing 

I've noticed that the order of the cast list has been changed several times in the past few weeks, mostly moving Patrick Dempsey and/or Isaiah Washington higher in the list.  I'm guessing that this has been done based on perceived importance in the castobviously those two names are frequently in the press and PD's """"McDreamy"""" is a huge pop culture thing and it could be argued that PD/Ellen Pompeo and IW/Sandra Oh are the two """"big"""" couples on the show, but that has nothing to do with the order of billingnor is the placement of IW and PD at the bottom of the list someone's idea of belittling their roles on the show.

 Okay, then let's turn it around: I don't know what your professional background is, but let's say you are contributing to an article fully in line with your profession, and you'll literally see dozens of users engaging in edit wars reverting not only your own edits, but also well-informed edits made by others - all this going on for a couple of days. That's exactly when you guys (i.e. ADMINS) you should have a careful look: I'm not the problem, at most I am a symptom of it, because I was trying to be part of the solution by pointing out the aforementioned issues. The quality fluctations of that particular article have been severe, it seems that there's a huge mess of people editing without any relevant background knowledge whatsoever. This has nothing to do with elitism: wikipedia (or any encyclopedia) cannot just thrive through people without any domain expertise. And other users have been highlighting these issues, too - but were ignored because their criticism also affected wp admins. Really, you cannot expect high quality articles if the people """"writing"""" it are merely acting like robots adding refs to articles that they don't understand, let alone briefings that they never watched in the first place. Regarding the term jackass, just look at the Jackass article, it describes fairly well what's going on there, just because there's huge public interest in the event, which attracts countless people who don't even bother getting informed in the first place, and rather prefer edit warring instead. BTW: I am not trying to talk common-sense to you, like I said: I don't care about this account and/or IP being blocked or not - not even if it should not be temporary. The real issue here is lack of quality, and lack of wp admins enforcing rules to ensure a higher degree of quality. And this problem will persist regardless of this particular account/IP/person being blocked, inactive or deleted. This seems to be a severe case of Dunning-Kruger's.

The Blackest Night

Hey, I'm looking for people to help me out with the creation of this article, care to lend a hand?   
Because the entire run has been building toward this event, there is already a wealth of information through every issue which can be used in the article.   

 Hulk (Comics) 

One note off topic. THANK YOU for the book recommendation. I've been hoping to get Iron Man up to a good GA before the movie, and could NOT get any help sourcing his communist bent. Comic Book nation does that well!   

In library now, will check it out tonight. It's wan on actual Hulk analysis overall, esp. in relation to Grest. Weinberg's science of superheros, or Simcha Weinstein's Up UP and Oy vey, but it'll help, no doubt, with Hulk, and hopefully other articles. I'm also looking at Tales to Astonish, by Ronin Ro, but... it' a bit more history of Marvel than of the characters, and covers most of the major character creations ins a paragraph, LOL - shows that the focus changes the coverage.   

see here.   

 Popular Music Sites 

Hi Wesley,

You mentioned that PureVolume, being a website for bands to host mp3s, is not suitable as a source.  Is this because a source should be a 3rd-party human being who has done original research or synthesis?  I realize that PureVolume (and any site that collects and presents data about usage) can present results that are made inaccurate through sockpuppets, but it still ends up being less slanted and biased than human beings, don't you think?   

 Kitty Pryde 

Hi Wesley.  Thanks for helping out with the page.  I haven't read that issue yet, but I did read an issue summary, so I tried to edit it back to standards.  Thanks for fixing that one, though.  At least that nonsense is over now.

 List of products in The Simpsons 

Hello George. I see you've been actively making additions to List of products in The Simpsons. It is good that you're enthusiastic about the list. However, I would like to suggest that you might be going a bit overboard. There are literally thousands of products and stores in The Simpsons that are seeing in single shots as throwaway jokes, etc. If one were to list them all, the list would be fairly bulky and useless (this has happened on other Simpsons lists already and have had to be cut back). I'd like to suggest the following guidelines:
Stores aren't products, so I would suggest you not list stores such as """"Herman's Military Antiques"""".
Bulk groups of products like the """"many antiques at Herman's Military Antiques"""".
Do not include real-world products like """"English Muffins"""". If you do that, it's pointless. Everything in the house is a product. TVs, couches, drapes, carpet, etc. Besides which, I would argue that noone in the world would ever need to look up whether English muffins are sold on the Simpsons. Real world products are assumed to exist on the show since it is rarely shown otherwise.
The list should really be for Simpsons-invented brand-names or invented products.

The next issue is subjective, but I believe crucial to keeping the list from spiraling out of control:
Products on the list should only be included if they are used more than once on the show. Throwaway jokes like Itchy & Scratchy Land Personalised License Plates are basically just describing a joke on the show. The list is really designed more for things like Laramie cigarettes, squishys and things that make up the Simpsons lore than a list of throwaway jokes. That doesn't mean some of your edits aren't perfect for the list; I believe you added """"Radioactive Man Comics"""", """"The Springfield Shopper"""" and """"Li'l Bastard Kits"""". These are great ones, but things like """"Disemboweller IV"""" needn't be included.

I am going to be deleting some of the ones that fall into the bullet point list above (real-world items and bulk groups) but I'm not going to immediately delete single-appearance items, but I suggest you join a discussion at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject The Simpsons#List of products in The Simpsons.

 Thanks DocJames for updating the article.  To the anonymous contributor, the article you reference states """"Men taking finasteride may not have an increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer. Adjusting for the known effects that finasteride has on prostate cancer detection, investigators estimated that high-grade tumors (Gleason scores 7–10) were no more likely in the men taking finasteride than in the men taking placebo. However, because very few prostate cancers were detected at Gleason scores of 8 to 10, it is difficult to draw conclusions about this group.""""
From this text, I think it would be appropriate to say something like - In contrast to the FDA's stance, the National Cancer Institute believes that finasteride may increase the ability to detect cancer which accounts for the higher prevalance of high-grade cancer.  The article didn't specifically mention the NIH, but if you can cite it feel free to add it in the article and somebody will change it if they object.   """,0.0

Also, as someone who is part of the LGBT community and has been intimately aware of AIDS and those with it since the early-80s, I can tell you that """"resentment"""" isn't really accurate.  Look, I've known more than 100 friends who have died from the disease - at least 2/3 of them dying in the 1980s; the remainder in the early to mid-1990s before the drugs got better and more effective over the long-term.  There was a time when I was attending multiple funerals every month.  I still know a good number of men who remain HIV positive but have somehow stayed alive with the disease for more than two decades.  I can testify as a first hand-witness that it wasn't """"resentment"""" people in the gay community were feeling, it was anger.  And certainly not because of Ryan White's openness of what it was like for someone outside the gay community to contract the disease.  The anger was directed largely at the US government as well as those who insisted that those who did get sick and die, died because of who they were and were being punished.  Ryan White and Elizabeth Glaser put a new face to AIDS, most certainly, but I know of *no one* in the gay community (and as someone who is actually a part of the gay community, I think I would have a better perspective than someone who isn't no matter how close they think they are/were to those in the queer world) who felt """"resentment"""" over the attention AIDS received after their AIDS diagnoses became public knowledge.

 Weeping Frenchman question

This note is to justify a change in a photo caption.
I have added a well-known historic photo to this page, of a Parisian weeping as German troops occupy his city.  Little is known of the origins of this photo, certainly not the identity of the man or why he cries.  It has been widely assumed that he is sorrowful, since he is witnessing foreign troops enter his home, the surrender of his armed forces, and the capitulation of his government.  I had always understood that this was the general sentiment throughout France, and certainly in occupied (non-Vichy) France.
The original caption stated simply that the man weeps.  This was the caption provided by the photo source (www.archives.gov) and the same caption that appears elsewhere in Wikipedia.  The new caption adds """"in joy or sorrow"""".  The addition adds unnecessary ambiguity, and makes a strong implication away from the general consensus on this photo.

"Wikipedia is a source of information on a huge range of issues and topics, many of which do not get an airing in conventional references; it is particularly useful in providing details on obscure flags across the planet that are not often featured in standard works.  Included in Wikipedia’s annals are the flags for example, of Khuzestani Arabs, ethnic Somalis in Kenya,  the Bakonjo of Uganda, the Turks of western Thrace – some decidedly obscure banners but I am grateful to Wikipedia contributors for providing information on these myriad groups which  allows me to know exactly whom these designs represent and understand the context when I see them aloft on news reports and elsewhere. Why therefore are we to be denied similar access to information concerning the extant flag in the English county of Dorset? 
The fact is that a gold flag with a red edged white cross, designated the “Dorset Cross”, can be seen flying across the county; it is also a fact that the town council in the Dorset town of Wimborne has embraced this as their preferred county flag. The design is therefore a tangible reality, that has evident popularity and the full support of a local authority, what factor in these circumstances makes the Dorset Cross ineligible for inclusion in Wikipedia? One might argue that the Dorset Cross is not an official flag - how many of the examples cited above can claim to be official? The four snakes and cross flag depicted in the entry on Martinique in fact specifically states that this is an “unofficial region flag” however, one presumes that it actually flies in the island i.e. it exists and is possessed of a certain popularity and is therefore worthy of note. How does the circumstance in Dorset differ? As in Martinique, the Dorset Cross flag is not official; as in Martinque, the flag can be seen flying in many places, how is this flag then not worthy of mention or depiction in Wikipedia? A trawl across the internet reveals that there are two flags currently commercially available as Dorset flags – one is a banner of the arms of the County Council, which design the general public is not legally entitled to fly, the other is the Dorset Cross, which the public demonstrably are flying but this reality is not being reflected in Wikipedia, where we currently have an illustration of the banner of the arms but none of the Dorset Cross – this strikes me as imbalanced and tendentious. 
The Dorset Cross is a contender in a current competition held under the auspices of the Dorset County Council to select a flag that they will themselves endorse. The competition itself is of course worthy of mention and when all the contenders are revealed they should of course all appear in Wikipedia but the fact is that notwithstanding said competition, the Dorset Cross is already flying and predates the competition and Wikipedia, in not allowing its depiction is guilty of misinformation. One relies on Wikipedia to advise that the flag of the Dinka is a five striped horizontal design and takes such advice on good faith; how odd therefore that one should not be similarly able to consult this resource on a flag that one can see flying in the streets and all about.User:Vexilo",0.0

 A philosophical story to embrace ones mind. 

The ancient Indian mathematicians were the first to discover the digit zero """"0"""" and implement it in the formation of digits. The whole world revolves like a cycle in the form of the digit zero. The Britishers dicovered an ancient egg of Dinosaures in India. What I mean to convey is that: India is the land where Lord Rama or Lord Krishna were born. Lord Rama was an example of a perfect ideal man on earth. His life story is an example for an ideal man to follow. Lord Rama, Lord Lakshmana, Lord Bharata and Lord Shatrughana were four sons of King Dhasratha of Ayodhya. He was cursed to die from the pain of separation from his son by the blind parents of Shrawan Kumar. Kaikeyi the mother of Bharata wishes to send Lord Rama on an exile for a period of 14 years and wishes her son Bharata to be the King of Ayodhya. Lord Rama and his wife Sita and his brother Lord Lakshmana leave for forests outside the kingdom of Ayodhya. Lord Rama's brother Lord Bharata persuades lord Rama to return back but lord Rama refuses to return to Ayodhya against the wishes of his step mother Kaikeyi. But Lord Bharata returns to Ayodhya along with the sandals of lord Rama and places the sandals of his brother Lord Rama on the throne and rules the kingdom of Ayodhaya in the name of Rama. This shows the example of love between an elder brother and his younger brother. In the forest once a demon shurpanaka sister of King Ravana disuades Lord Rama to marry her, but Lord Rama tells her that he is already married and points towards his brother Lord Lakshmana who cuts off her nose and ears to show her ugly nature and character. Shurphanaka runs off and complains about Lord Rama and Lord Lakshamana to King Ravana of Lanka. King Ravana somehow manages to kidnap Goddess Sita the wife of Lord Rama in revenge to Lanka. Lord Rama grieves for his separation from his beloved wife Goddess Sita. Here the feelings of an ideal person in the form of lord grieving from separation from his beloved wife are beautifully described by Sage Valmiki who wrote the whole Ramayana. Sage Valmiki was a thief named Ratnakar who by the japam of Lord Sri Rama became a great sage named Valmiki and wrote a great epic called Ramanaya the story of King Rama and Sita. Lord Rama and Lord Lakshamana move towards southern India where they meet the lord Hanuman, (the great son of Anjani and Kesari; Lord Hanumanji is also known as Pavanputra or the great celibate bachelor) and Lord Sugriva and with the help of vanara sena or Army of Monkeys they move into the kingdom of Lanka and kill the demon king Ravana. Lord Rama rescues Goddesses Sita and with the help of Lord Hanuman they return back to Ayodhya. A fourteen years had lapsed when lord Rama had left the kingdom of Ayodhya. When lord Rama, Goddesses Sita, Lord Lakshmana and lord Hanuman return to Ayodhya, the people of Ayodhya cheer up and lit up the whole Ayodhya with Diyas in order to celebrate the victory and return of their king Lord Rama. The festival Dusherra is celebrated every year as a victory of good over evil as the demon Meghanad {the son of King Ravana},the demon Kumbhakarna {the brother of king Ravana} and the demon King Ravana of Lanka were killed by Lord Rama and Lord Lakshmana in order to rescue Goddesses Sita from her captivity in Lanka. And on the occassion of their return to Ayodhya the festival Diwali is celebrated throughout India every year with  great pomp and show of lights and crackers. Whenever some troubled minds read this story of Ramayana their minds gain peace and the self confidence is restored as their spirits become calm, pacified and brave in the troubled periods of time. The Epic Ramayana denotes the greatness of Supreme God Lord Rama as an ideal human being on earth.  """,0.0

 Concerns
Got a message about an hour ago from Professor Obar of the Media and Telecommunication Policy project and I think it is viewed best in full:

Can you please communicate to the online mentors that I DO NOT want them moving student material into the main space for them. This is a big problem. I have noticed that this has happened with a number of the projects already, for example, in the broadband.gov article and the media cross-ownership article. We need the students to be doing this on their own, of course so they can learn how to do it, and also so that I can grade what they've done. How am I supposed to follow student submissions if the data is associated with online mentors? A BIG PROBLEM ALREADY... please help me with this. None of you responded to my post about this on the discussion page. This is about to get out of hand. Jaobar (talk) 

With that, of course, please only give instructions on how to move, don't do it for them.  Please only let them know what to do and let them do it themselves.  If they run into problems, provide further instructions.  Do not it for them.  This seems to be making a mess of Prof. Obar's grading system and I would like to avoid that.  Thanks. -  • Talk • Coor.

 MS JACKSON LYRICS 

[Andre 3000]
Yeah this one right here goes out to all the baby's mamas, mamas...
Mamas, mamas, baby mamas, mamas
Yeah, go like this

CHORUS: Andre 3000
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson [OOOH]

Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson [OOOH]

Never meant to make your daughter cry

[Big Boi]
My baby's drama mama, don't like me
She be doin things like havin them boys come from her neighborhood 
to the studio tryin to fight me
She need to get a, piece of the american pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby, and not a paycheck
Private school, daycare shit, medical bills, I pay that
I love your mom and everything, but see I ain't the one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war, my lawyers stay down
She never got a chance 
to hear my side of the story we was divided
She had fish fries and cookouts 
for my child's birthday I ain't invited
Despite it, I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah

CHORUS:
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson [OOOH]
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson [OOOH]

Me and your daughter.. got a special thang goin on
You say it's puppy love (arf arf arf)
We say it's full grown (ARF ARF WOOF!)
Hope that we feel this.. feel this way forever
You can plan a pretty picnic
but you can't predict the weather, Ms. Jackson

Ten times out of nine, now if I'm lyin; fine
The quickest muzzle throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing, together dream
bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
on the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever, ever, forever, ever?
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day by day ruler can't be too long
Ms. Jackson my intentions were good I wish I could
become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Askin what happened to the feelin that her and me
Had, I pray so much about it need some knee, pads
It happened for a reason one can't be, mad
So know this, know that everything is cool
And yes I will be present on the first day of school, 
and graduation

CHORUS:
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson [OOOH]
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson [OOOH]
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry

Uh, uh, yeah
""""Look at the way he treats me"""" 
Shit, look at the way you treat me
You see your little nosy-ass homegirls 
done got your ass sent up the creek G
Without a paddle, you left to straddle 
and ride this thing on out
Now you and your girl ain't speakin no more 
cause my dick all in her mouth
You know what I'm talking about Jealousy, infidelity, envy
Cheating to beating, and D to the G they be the same thing
So who you placin the blame on, you keep on singin the same song
Let bygones be bygones, you can go on and get the hell on
You and your mama

"Winifred Brunton (Wikiquette, good faith, be nice...)... 

Winifred's painting technique for the pharaonic portraits:

. . . I turned to the statutes and reliefs. These would show me how the sitters impressed the artists of those days, and the work of an artist's chisel or brush is at least as good evidence as the sworn word of a witness in a court of law, at any rate when the artist is as literal-minded as were the Egyptians. Do we not know the honest mistakes a man in the witness-box can make? And shall we not concede the difference between a trained and an untrained observer?The ancient artist was a trained observer; I would examine his trained evidence on what he saw, and compare it with what I could see today of the Pharaohs. This done, discrepancies appeared which could not be disregarded. And besides, the various artists who portrayed a Pharaoh did not all agree in detail among themselves. This added to the difficulty! It was evident that some detailed and perhaps laborious comparing would have to be done. I had recourse again to the mummy, and took the face carefully back through the process of mummification.

Certain confirmations appeared of the artists' evidence; these I accepted and retained, especially as they seemed to me to agree with the king's known character. Discrepancies on the other hand could be partly accounted for by the changes in the subject between youth and old age, and partly by the deference due to kings. Finally I did construct a firm scaffolding on which to build my portrait, and so the picture of Sety I was begun.The costume was a simpler problem. One had only to consult the monuments and the jewel-room of the Museum, and to be careful to avoid howlers such as a dinner party parure with a field-service helmet, and so on. Ramses II was next attempted, and I was greatly cheered by the recognition of my resuscitated kings by several eminent archaeologists. Not all the Egyptologists who recognised my portraits realised the method in my madness, the slow sifting of evidence and the laborious brick-making. To many they seemed flights of a fancy only slightly, if at all, controlled by research.

''But one of the most famous of them all, namely Professor Breasted, gave me enormous encouragement. Whatever was to be thought of these particular portraits, he admitted that this was a line of research not hitherto tried, but perfectly legitimate and which might conceivably yield valuable results. His kind words so stimulated me that I made similar attempts with other defunct royalties, and gradually completed the series of kings and queens which appear in these pages.",0.0

An excellent excellent start. There's an infobox, pictures and maps, and extensive details. I wonder if there is anything more to be added on such an incredibly famous battle? In addition, just a few minor stylistic improvements - (1) the introduction does not state, or even imply, the incredible fame and importance of this battle. If I came across this article, somehow having never heard of Salamis, I'd read the intro and think """"oh, this is just another one of those battles from those Greek wars that I never understood anything about"""", and I'd move on. As it stands now, you have to scroll all the way to the bottom in order to see anything about the importance and fame of the battle. (2) I wonder if there is any better way to organize the listing of the numbers of ships. Obviously, regular paragraph form will look quite confusing and ugly, and a table would likely take up just as much space as the list... can anything be done here? Maybe a table with multiple columns? Otherwise, a very nice article for a very major topic.

Well, Stricker actually has a finding of research misconduct against him ; he fudged data to get an NEJM paper that was retracted by his three co-authors when they found out what he did: .  As a consequence, was barred by the ORI from receiving or applying for federal grants for three years in the 1990s.  So he's previously gotten into serious trouble for throwing out data that doesn't fit his preferred hypothesis.
In recent years, his publications seem to be almost exclusively low-impact papers, opinion bits, and letters related to Morgellons and the related dubious diagnosis of chronic Lyme disease.  I suppose it's possible that he might be """"leading his field"""", but if so it's taking an awfully long time for anyone to start following.  It's looking much more like he's just wandering in the wilderness.
And the advent of the """"open-peer-review"""" journals (where the journal publicly posts the identities and sometimes the comments of peer reviewers) opens a window on at least some mild shenanigans regarding reviewer selection in some of his recent papers.  This 2013 F1000 paper has a publisher's note about an undisclosed conflict of interest, where one of the reviewers was co-authoring another manuscript with the paper's authors while reviewing the F1000 paper.  And one of the reviewers of the current paper (BMC Dermatology, 2015) was Robert Bransfield , who is actually acknowledged in the paper (!) () for his contributions.  This sort of thing has a couple of likely explanations—Stricker (et al.) are deliberately pointing journal editors at very friendly peer reviewers (and these mostly-crappy, low-impact journals don't do much due diligence), potential conflicts of interest be damned; or these papers are so far out on the fringe that it's very difficult for journal editors to find anyone who is willing to waste time on reviewing manuscripts on these topics, so they're relaxed about their reviewer standards; or both.

  Army Medical Services Museum branding equipment Dear Gaius, 

My name is Simon Barnard. I'm an author and illustrator residing in Melbourne, Australia. Currently I'm producing a book on British convicts transported to Australia with Text Publishing. 

Amongst the convicts sentenced to Australia are over 1,000 army deserters, many of whom were branded with a 'd'. Your photo of the branding equipment and human skin located in the Army Medical Museum is of great interest to me. 

I've contacted the Museum in an attempt obtain more information and, in particularly, a photo of the skin, but they're unable to assist.

I'm rather desperate to obtain a decent photo of the skin and am hoping you might be able to help me in this bizarre quest.

MOSAR is not law, it is a guideline, and one limited to Wikipedia at that.

This was a disaster for me,my life reached a dead end.I began searching for God,and found all of the answers to life's mysteries that were previously unanswered.

Your contributed article, Supply chian Management in Construction
 Hello, I notice that you recently created a new page, Supply chian Management in Construction. First, thank you for your contribution; Wikipedia relies solely on the efforts of volunteers such as yourself. Unfortunately, the page you created covers a topic on which we already have a page - Supply chain management. Because of the duplication, your article has been tagged for speedy deletion. Please note that this is not a comment on you personally and we hope you will to continue helping improve Wikipedia. If the topic of the article you created is one that interests you, then perhaps you would like to help out at Supply chain management - you might like to discuss new information at the article's talk page. 

If you think that the article you created should remain separate, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page that has been nominated for deletion (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. Lastly, please note that if the page does get deleted, you can contact one of these admins to request that they  userfy the page or have a copy emailed to you. Additionally if you would like to have someone review articles you create before they go live so they are not nominated for deletion shortly after you post them, allow me to suggest the article creation process and using our search feature to find related information we already have in the encyclopedia.

They are fairly recently founded and have thus not established themselves as a professional association and charge for premium membership, so one might consider this a commercial link.

In each case I see a membership based organization formed as a non-profit with the intention of helping professionals network.  Is there a Carpenters of Plumbers union.  As far as I can tell the ITSMPA is no different except there seems less undue vendor influence and commercial intent than some of the others.

The """"rules"""" you are asking for are probably most relevantly WP:ELNO and WP:ELYES. However an RfC such as this one may produce a valid local consensus for interpretation of these guidelines.

However, from what I can tell, even the peer forums require a paid membership. The free basic membership doesn't give you any more access on the website than is available to the general public. I think that means this fails WP:ELNO #6: """"Links to sites that require payment or registration to view the relevant content, unless the site itself is the subject of the article, or the link is a convenience link to a citation.""""

With the new article you created, you seem to be almost entirely using information from the vacuum aspiration article.  Spin-off articles (like your new article) are usually only done when the main article (in this case vacuum aspiration) is very long.  I don't know that that section is ready to be spun off into its own article yet - please read Wikipedia:Content forking#Article spinouts - """"Summary style"""" articles.

I believe the best thing to do would be to add any new information you think is important into the vacuum aspiration article, and change your new article Manual vacuum aspiration or MVA into a redirect to vacuum aspiration.

Please let me know if you believe MVA is a sufficiently broad topic to need its own article.  Otherwise, I will go ahead and make the MVA article into a redirect. Talk     C   """,0.0

There is a confusion between the different definitions of heterosexuality.

Likewise, there needs to be a distinction between people with a heterosexual orientation and people who have sexual relationships with people of the opposite gender.  I think if we reorganize the page like the homosexual page this distinction would be more clear.  For example, it would make clear that reproduction results from heterosexual sex, not from a heterosexual orientation.

"joshbuddy, your editing leaves me gasping! Your Lead-in is not only void of verification; it also presents several outright false statements, and seriously misrepresents other items. 

1. The statement that “Jehovah's Witnesses teach that blood is sacred and must not be eaten or transfused whole” is grossly misleading because all Jehovah’s Witnesses do not teaching this and your statement implies all of them do. Hence this statement of yours misrepresents. 

2. The statement “This view was put forward by the second president of the Watchtower Joseph Franklin Rutherford” not only lacks verification, it is just plain false. Rutherford did not teach that blood per se was sacred, and he never condemned blood transfusion. 

3. The statement “Beginning in 1980, the medical use of certain products derived from blood became permissible” is not verified, and it is just plain false. Watchtower doctrine tolerated some products derived from blood as early as November of 1961, which was only ten months after blood transfusion became a shunning offence. 

4. The statement “there is evidence that some Jehovah's Witnesses have secretly taken medical products derived from blood or blood transfusions” is a patent misrepresentation. Verifiable source material demonstrates that some Jehovah’s Witnesses have also openly accepted blood transfusion! 

5. The statement, “The non-acceptance of blood products by groups like the Jehovah's Witnesses has caused many hospitals to offer bloodless medicine” is another horrible misconstruction. When it comes to the Watchtower organization’s blood doctrine, there is no other similar group, and you have not referenced one either. 

Your statement manifests a serious lack of qualification to address this subject. You manifest ignorance of the subject, and a willingness to edit despite that lack. Hence I have reverted to the verified introduction, which feeds nicely into the article as a whole. 

You have yet to answer questions asked of you in relation to the verified Lead-in language, will you ever?",0.0

"Having looked more closely at the initial references you linked me to (before even glancing at the latest ones) I now realize that they are multiple and all say the same thing, so I've redacted what I had originally said about it possibly being a typo - one or two typos are possible, consistently being wrong multiple times is not.  All I can state is that the novel has Elphinstone as the rank I stated, but quite possibly that was a literary tweak in order to make Christian the only Master's Mate. I'm certainly not going to claim the fictional variant is correct and all the non-fictional versions are wrong! Now that I look at Elphinstone's and Churchill's ages, Elphinstone (at 36) is 8 years older than Churchill (at 28) so it is unlikely, but by no means impossible, that Elphinstone was junior in rank to Churchill.  To be honest, I'm a bit confused why there would be 2 Master's Mates on the same ship with so small a crew - is that normal?  That would make it the only rank on the Bounty for which there was more than one instance other than quartermaster (and of course, able seaman!).  Anyway, I don't want to get stuck on this issue - I had asked who you the other Master's Mate was and you told me. My response to your reply is now a bit of a digression, but hopefully an informative one. Let's move on. Granted that Elphinstone is indeed a Master's Mate, the number of crew not berthed in the forecastle in point (5) below is now 15 not 14, which is still greater than 13. 66.16.144.18",0.0

Oxonian2006, my tone may sound a bit out of control but I'm not. Issues like this one are very important to me due to my own family history. Now, going further into your comment...unfortunately the knowledge of the occupation of Poland is not as universal as you may think. To many """"the Nazis"""" does not mean the Germans as you suggested. Poland was not occupied by the """"Nazis"""" who came from """"Greenland or Mars"""" or """"Nazi allies"""". Poland was occupied by the Nazi Germany or German Army (Wehrmacht) and at the beginning of the war also by the Soviet Union or Red Army. There were no other German allied troops occupying Poland unless you count Italian, Spanish and other Waffen SS troops marching to the Eastern Front. """"The German-led Nazi occupation"""" you suggested is also incorrect, there was no such thing. Half of Poland was incorporated into the Third Reich with their citizens either murdered or expelled into the """"General Government"""" which was created and %100 controlled by the Nazi Germany, nobody else. 
Therefore he """"Nazi"""" is NOT a perfectly good word to use in this case and never will be.
Now, about the Polanski who in your opinion is not a Holocaust survivor. Well...he escaped the Cracow Ghetto on the way to the extermination camp. He would be dead otherwise. Then he barely survived hiding at sympathetic to him farmers barn avoiding the Germans who would kill him immediately if found. Every Jew hiding outside the Ghettos was immediately shot by the Germans. His rescuers and rescuers family was also killed.  I don't dare to suggest that you did not know about that. Every Jew who survived the war in Poland is a Holocaust survivor and it does not matter if he managed to survive Auschwitz, Cracow Ghetto or by hiding in the forest.

Image Tagging Image:Mm2323.JPG

 This media may be deleted.

Thanks for uploading Image:Mm2323.JPG. I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the copyright status is unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then there needs to be an argument why we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then it needs to be specified where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.

If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the  tag can be used to release it under the GFDL. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, consider reading fair use, and then use a tag such as  or one of the other tags listed at Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use.  See Wikipedia:Image copyright tags for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.

If you have uploaded other media, consider checking that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the """"my contributions"""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"Image"""" from the dropdown box.

 BCN-SIA discussion 

First, sorry because my poor english.

Hi, i don't want to start a undo-war or something like that, but the avionews post is only a rumour. It's a propaganda speech from a Milan SEA not a declaration of any SIA officer.

I've talked with the SIA spanish comercial manager and he says me that the italian SIA officers inmediatly deny that issue, nor the SIA-BCN cancellation, nor the FCO-MXP flights traspassing... and all is a simply propaganda from Milan in this moments of crisis. This was also confirmed by SIA London regional headquarters...

Unfortunately, I haven't found any italy/UK SIA press relase dennying the Milan SEA president affirmations but i think that informations that I have are enough to question the avionews article.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

Because of that, I have """"twicked"""" the comment from """"until summer 2009"""" to """"probably until summer 2009, in which they could codeshare with other Star Alliance partners""""
In the article, the text refered (Today the SiA flights carry out the Singapore-Malpensa-Barcelona route but in short time the flight will be reduced to Singapore-Malpensa route, while the continuation to Barcelona will be assured by Lufthansa Italia), is not referenced as Bonomi's words but as an explanation by Avionews.

"I have no idea why you are posting the slang definitions of 'fuck'.  That is a total non-sequitur.  I have not seen anyone here assert that there aren't any ways of using 'fuck' that are slang.  The point was, and remains, that the standard use of the word 'fuck' as both a noun and a verb - the only ways that this word has been used in this entire discussion throughout this entire week up until your latest post - has been the standard definition that is widely understood and accepted as a normal word that is nowhere near slang.

You used this non-sequitur as your basis for reversion.  And to this day you are persisting in it.  Yet again another example of a huge logic disconnect that permeates this entire exchange.

As for the meta-discussion (the discussion about the discussion), Andy's revert was based upon his assessment that the issue needed to be discussed before such a change could be accepted.  And where did he choose to raise that discussion?  Over on my User Talk page.  That is the most inappropriate place to have such a discussion.  I suggested to him that the discussion be moved here.  Instead he moved it to an Admin page where he called for me to be blocked.  Is that the action of anyone who wants rational discussion?  (This too are questions that I do not need anyone's answer to.)

As for your opinion that this issue is now resolved, I never shared any such view.  I added the 'See also' link as a step in the right direction.  Not as a cure.

 Up to your old tricks I see 

Thankfully I have not had the displeasure or the need to smell your odious stench on this site for a while as thankfully wikipedia is large enough to avoid contemptible creatures like you.

However I notice we have crossed swords again with you crying out your age old mantra - like the fucktard you are - it's """"unsourced"""". Well done, fucking well done, you are so pig-shit thick and lazy rather than 1. do a little bit of work and find some sources yourself, you just delete stuff because it takes less effort, or 2. assume good faith. Most people don't make stuff up that they add. If you had one iota of sense in that pig-shit brain of yours, you would at least do a quick internet search to check the facts before having a WP:OWN fap and then deleting anything that you like. 

Personally I think, and I have said this before, you make absolutely no positive contributions to this site. Just looking at your edit log clearly shows you generate nothing or even bother to write something = er this is an encyclopedia. If you had your way, it would be whittled down to nothing. You have got talent or knowledge except self-importance because it's easier to be a fucking Rules Lawyer than an editor. 

I have nothing but the utter contempt for you because you cannot even do the most simplest of things and look up something. If Wikipedia is measured by the likes of you, then it's stands by the lowest common denominator: ignorance. Your application of sourcing is so fucked up and arbitrary it's laughable. Are you the sort asshole who needs to see it on the news to figure out the Pope's a catholic? etc After seeing what you have been up to butchering articles like a retard with a paper cutter, I pray to all things dark and evil that you will eventually fuck with one of this site's even worse self-important cunts.

Different set of rules for different users

Hi, Romaioi. I have read your talkpage and I see that you have suffered a very sad experience, similar to the one that has banned me and others. I am user:Marygiove and I totally agree with you about what you write in your """"special archive"""". At least you can console yourself thinking that you now are not banned, while others like me have no such a """"luck"""". My only crime? To live in the metropolitan area of Miami (nearly 3 million people!) and so my IP is similar to the one of other italian users banned from wikipedia and who live here, like user:Brunodam and user:Cherso.  Anyway, as you wrote in your """"MFD Link"""", it is clear that Jimbo's rules are not followed and that there are """"different set of rules for different users"""", specially if there are nationalistic groups (like some  Croats who hate Italians) that pressure some admins to accept ONLY their POV on issues about the croatian Dalmatia.  I don't know if you are able to read italian, but may be you would be interested in accessing this website ( brunodam.blog.kataweb.it/2008/10/18/altri-commenti-sul-diniego-dellasilo-di-zara/), where some italians name you as an example of what is """"rotten"""" in the english wikipedia about impartiality of some admins dealing with italians and croats.

BTW, do you know that all the mess you have gone trough was started by one of the group of the nationalistic yugoslavians, named user:AlasdairGreen27?  He promoted the ban (with another of the group named Direktor) of an article about the """"Italian mare nostrum"""" written by Brunodam, and when you copied some sections of it in another article he believed you were Brunodam (or GiovanniGiove or Pio). In the section """"It is Bruno """" you can easily read that Noclador is convinced by this Alasdair that Brunodam is Romiaoi and/or  others (http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:AlasdairGreen27&diff;=prev&oldid;=230773625#It.27s_Bruno_:-.29).  In other words, the astute Alasdair throwed the stone and then waited for Noclador to do all the fighting for him! This trick has been done by the croat group even other times with other persons: it is a trick used many times by the Tito propaganda agents and modelled from the Stalin KGB. And it seems to work well, seeing the fight that has happened between you and Noclador. Sincerely. Marygiove.""",0.0

They're IMMIGRANTS, they CHOSE to come to Canada, and it should be that they should respect OUR traditions -though keeping their customs and traditions, I have nothing against multiculturalism-. We cannot bend over backwards for people who have done nothing for the country! It's like subjecting to bullying, it's not bloody right! And the usage of """"God"""" and """"son"""" means nothing! It's a traditional piece. I am an atheist, and an agnostic, yet I have no objection to prayer in my school's chapel, to singing Christian lyrics, because it pertains no meaning to me. Are not God, Jesus, Allah, Mohammed, Buddha, and ANY other religious deity supposed to all be working for the same cause? Should not they all be """"friends""""??? SO may I ask WHAT is the problem with the Canadian anthem? Allah, Jesus, Mohammed, Buddha and God are all manifestations of the SAME PERSON, THING, CAUSE, REASON! The Canadian anthem is traditional, and it seems to me almost a sacrilege (if you may excuse the poor choice of word, as it seems to contradict my whole speech!) to complain about it being sexist, or bigotry. This ties in with the controversy over the Queen. She is a testament to the tradition of Canada, to remove her would be to follow in the footsteps of the United States. We are not Yanks, we are members of the commonwealth. To get back on track, I state clearly, there is absolutely no logical, moral or respectful way that it can be stated to change the lyrics to a traditional song! A song is a song. You cannot opt to change the lyrics to a controversial popular song, like """"The Beatles""""! You just don't do it! So HOW should it be the same for the anthem? The anthem represents what Canada is. It was established as Christian, and though we gladly accept other cultures, we cannot change every damn thing to be politically correct for all the minorities out there. It's IMPOSSIBLE. Freedom of speech has become the opposite. Comedians can't make jokes about religion, sexuality, gender without being complained at, reprimanded at by minorities. Australia is a perfect example of how a country should be run. They say to immigrants: """"You make the choice to live here. That means you have to live with the way Australians live, Australian code, Australian traditions. Don't come here expecting us to change just for you."""" This is how a country should be. It seems unfair that we should change everything to be politically correct, just so that some bleeding heart out there can go to their bed -Oh, is that politically incorrect to the homeless? I'll change that to """"area of rest""""- and not grumble and whine, prepared to get up the next morning and petition to change all the lyrics of gospel music, or to remove all films that even mention a religious deity in a disrespectful manner.

(Ebyabe made comments which appear to be reasonable at first glance, but are actually unreasonable because one is fraudulent and the other was untrue regarding a place where she could see that it was untrue.)  Well a sort-of reasonable comment anyway because he claims that I am being """"confrontational"""" when it is clearly visible at my talk page that other users are attacking me and not the other way around.  I have not caused any confrontation...   I have replied to other users who are putting a confrontation to me.  (I did ask how to report a user, but I did not actually report him because nobody answered regardless of several posts made, and the user himself did not comment there, so that was not a confrontation like it would have been if I'd been able to make the report.)  I would like to leave a message at this user User:Stwalkerster's talk page but I cannot, because for some reason those are blocked to, so I have to do it this way instead.  Hopefully he has the notifications turned on (tags of username).  I can be calm and work with other people.  This is noted in my first reply, where it gives several examples of how users should have had discussion instead of attacking and reverting me and arguing hostilely on my talk page.  Users who wish to work with me should not make attacks, write words like """"compliance"""", revert edits when they could have further fixed the edit instead (details of referred-to edits in a separate paragraph below, make false claims against me, or delete my replies on discussion pages (not talk pages) and then ARCHIVE it after removing them!!  (Users should not do these kinds of things to anyone.)  What this means is that if users act in a reasonable manner, then a normal discussion can ensue (including from myself).  Merely because someone has used a template, written a shorter reply, or wrote their aggressive, confrontational remarks in a business-style manner, does not mean that they are """"being reasonable"""" or """"writing nicely"""".  When someone makes a falsified report about you or writes a falsified comment, etc., it is not reasonable to expect the victim to reply without mentioning this, or to want to """"be friends"""" with the attacker.  If the other people are being reasonable then of COURSE I am going to reply to them in a different way.  Editing an article by...(below) is not reasonable, nor is """"ganging up"""" (the discussion page), nor is replying in several places at once, etc.  How can replying to other users stating bad and/or false things about you be """"confrontational""""?  I have mentioned several times about having an actual discussion but no one did this and instead just kept replying on my talk pages.  The fact that I mentioned having a discussion indicates that I think reasonable discussion is the right or reasonable way to do it.  Just no one wanted to do anything but attack me so I did not have another way.

The headlines are not """"veiled"""", they are in plain light.  It was not any attempt to be """"hidden"""".  For headline #5, I literally do or did not know of a different way to title this headline which is not an attack on myself.  For headline #8, it is truthful and the falsification was blatant by Ebyabe, and I actually expected her to edit it to something on her next message.  I mean she directly mentions it; edit summary says a reason but her message says differently (directly, not implied).  For this headline, it is not a """"personal attack"""" because it is true and evident: Administrator complains about my signature even though signature has been changed, and messages by me since posted, before the block happened, as well as direct linking to comments which contain no personal attacks as a reason for """"personal attacks"""".  If the titles were UNTRUE they would be attacks, but since they are true unambiguously then they can't be attacks. The last headline yes, somewhat motivated/hostile, because he is the one put an useless headline so that there's TWO AT ONCE, *AFTER* my notice is up, while also writing the things that show the actual tyranny (a word used in this case solely because it is already being talked about, and not meant as any attack/instigation/hostile/etc.). Although the link by Jamie appears to say something about political opinions, if someone is making false claims then it is appropriate for them to be exposed.

So as you can see my intents are to be reasonable and normal (with the 'possible' exception of this particular headline), and repeatedly asking other people to do this, but being annoyed by all their attacks and false remarks as well.

"Absolute Proof that 0.999... IS NOT EQUAL TO 1 
A math-wiki:

You are wrong about infinite representation. The ancient Greeks *never* represented 1/3 as 0.333... 

Now let me refute your argument regarding the transitive property:

A)    1=3(1/3)
B)    3(1/3) = 3(0.333...)
C)    3(0.333...) =0.999... 

The problem here occurs in B) where you assume that 3 * 0.333... = 3 * 1/3. You have 'not proved' anything. On the contrary, you have only proved that you are assuming 1/3 = 0.333... which it is obviously 'not equal'. 0.333... is an 'indeterminate' number because it cannot be represented finitely in base 10. 
0.333... is not equal to 1/3 so you cannot say that 1/3 is a finite representation. An indeterminate number is a number that is repeating in any
radix system.

You mention the division algorithm but do you know what it says? The division algorithm has 'nothing' to do with radix systems. Let me state it for you - If a and b are two given integers, there are unique integers q and r
such that a=bq + r and  0<= r < b. Now I will use the division algorithm to prove that you are WRONG once and for all. Suppose a = 1 and b = 0.999..., then 
what are the integers q and r such that the above is true?

Suppose that q = 0 and r = 1. Then the division algorithm fails because it makes a false statement i.e. q and r can both be 0 and 1 respectively.
For example: 1 = (0.999...)(1)+0 and 1 = (0.999...)(0)+1. So by default, the
division algorithm is proved false if 0.999... is equal to 1. And you can say a lot of things about the Greeks, but they would not make a stupid mistake like this. They were the smartest race in ancient times.

Now suppose that you try to tell me that either form is acceptable in the case of 0 and 1, you will still end up with a terrible contradiction:

1=(0.999...)(0)+1. The second form in this case implies that 1 < 0.999... since r < b. But how can 1 be less than 0.999... ??!!

I want the world to know what f..g idiots run this site. You are a bunch of retarded, conceited fools who I look upon with the utmost hatred and condemnation. Your site is absolute crap because it is run by fools like Michael

 Why compare only to Windows 2000 features? 

As this issue has clearly caused quite a bit of confusion, I've decided to address it here. Windows XP is in the unique position - compared to all other Windows releases I can think of - of being at the convergence point of two separate Windows product lines, that of Windows NT and the old, MS-DOS-based Windows 9x. However, the core code in XP is based on the former and not the latter (hence XP has an internal version number of 5.1, while Windows 2000 has one of 5.0 - among numerous other things). A list of every single feature included in Windows ME (the last of the MS-DOS based versions) but not in XP would be quite long indeed, and also quite pointless, because it would be comparing operating systems of two very different architectures. (There's also the fact that comparisons between the other """"List of features removed in Windows"""" articles and this one would actually be made far more difficult.)   """,0.0

I can cast some light on:

1. CZMarlin's contribution 

CZMarlin is a tireless promoter of AMC vehicles (he owns at least two and has a website dedicated to AMC products). As he knows, I have developed the view that he seems to use the project quite persistently as a PR medium for the defunct corporation and its products. It is, I believe, to this end that, it seems to me, he has habitually fought against sourced material that brings neutrality and balance to articles on AMC products, e.g. AMC Pacer, Gremlin etc.  

It is true that I was deeply frustrated by the apparent determination with which he misrepresented others’ contributions in order to justify their deletion, e.g. . I was also frustrated by his apparent insistence on idiosyncratic and erroneous interpretations of the English language, and also by what appeared to be deliberately erroneous interpretation of verifiable facts, e.g.   errors that cannot be permitted in an  encyclopedia.  

My sincere belief that English was not CZM’s first language arose from the manner in which he uses it and the difficulties of communicating with him. (Examples on request.) I disagree that I belittled him for it – as a non-native English speaker myself, it's not something I would do.  Indeed I offered to help him with the language (offer ignored) and told him he could seek help from WP volunteer translators, so that he could write in Polish (also ignored).  

True, I ridiculed him when his behaviour seemed so extreme as to appear ridiculous to me.  I should not have done so. But we get frustrated when we try to work with an editor who, it seems, demonstrates provocatively scant regard for factual accuracy, neutrality, balance and clarity of communication . Granted, I should not have let my frustration show. 

The 'known vandal' CZM mentions is in fact an IP address used by one or more people. The address had a history of vandalism. When I saw a constructive edit from it I tried to encourage the contributor in her/his constructive behaviour; and later suggested the sandbox for experiments:  , . My posts encouraged constructive behaviour. 

CZM's damaging claim that these posts encouraged disruptive behaviour is totally false. (This gives a flavour of the difficulties I had with him.) It also casts serious doubt on the reliability of his contribution here, and also on his good faith.

He implies that my use of the term 'AMC cuckoos' was insulting. Not so, as he well knows, because I explained it to him when he showed that he had misunderstood the idiom: I used the term in an edit summary to describe the long-winded and inappropriate descriptions of certain AMC cars that he had introduced  like cuckoos in a nest  into an article on a certain aspect of automotive aerodynamics .

My  'another sophomoric CZM error' was mischievous but (IMO) harmless retaliation for CZM’s previous sniffy dismissal of some Google research I had posted to a discussion, which he denigrated as 'sophomoric research'. He seems to have forgotten that.  

The reference to 'little fuhrer' is more serious, and I should not have used it even though it mentioned no names (so no harm done to CZM’s reputation). Why that particular metaphor? I’m afraid I regarded CZM’s approach to editing as uncollaborative and perfunctory to the point of being dictatorial; and ruthless in its uncritical promotion of AMC and its products.

2. Collect’s contribution 

Just as he could list my transgressions (""""I have a list of [Writegeist's] comments""""), so also could I recite a litany of his own. Meh. Tit for tat gets us nowhere.

However it is worth noting that an antagonism grew between us at the Sarah Palin pages when it became apparent to Collect that I disagreed with much of his input, whereas he had assumed from one of my earliest contributions there that I would be an ally (he left an appreciative note on my Talk). Yet despite the difficulties between us, it was with scrupulous fairne",0.0

Hey  Kuru, 

There is  something really wrong with the administration of Wikipedia, and I am not the only one to know about and complains!.

For quite a while I had been hesitant but after a comment by a Polish Wikipedian I was finally encouraged to leave Polish Wikipedia (for some time only perhaps). I decided to move to the English Wikipedia for a change.

Although I am aware that  he (Kpjas)  have his  """"own problems"""" for some it might be a positive development!

I want to remind you that in US  at one time they needed to block the IP of US gov ... because  the politicians were polishing their resumes and were using the Wikipedia as they election platform!

You Have responded to  my  comments (in a way positively).

The problem is still that bunch of  administrators have  NO idea what the hell they  are talking about.

Please read my comments  and make  appropriate  corrections as  a shoddy  communist agent's tabloid operating the disinformation campaign shall NEVER  be called  a prominent newspaper!
You do not call a clochard a prince and prince a clochard!
There is to much crap like this specially  related to abuse by the polish administrators  who are  either  connected with the propaganda machine or are brain washed. 

As  an expert on many issues I believe that all  IPs  of some bloody idiots from  Poland should be banned for all other languages so we will have the real and unbiased by the people who do not understand what is Freedom, Liberty and Democracy and  vandalize the web pages with their totalitarian communist bias after being brain washed   since 1945 by several decades from generation to generation and educated by the communist teachers!

Dear Ronz,

PSB the embedded links and the areas which I am trying to update: 

1. The multi-stage fitness test, also known as the bleep test, beep test, pacer test, Leger-test or 20-m shuttle run test, is used by sports coaches and trainers to estimate an athlete's VO2 max (maximum oxygen uptake). The test is especially useful for players of sports like rugby, soccer, Australian rules football, hockey, netball, handball, tennis, squash and fitness testing at schools and colleges plus many other sports; employed by many international sporting teams as an accurate test of Cardiovascular fitness, one of the all-important """"Components of Fitness"""". This test is also part of the FITNESSGRAM - Commercial Link, incorrect and unrelated to the Multi-stage Fitness Test physical fitness test to measure cardiorespiratory - Typo fitness. The test was created by Luc Leger, University of Montreal[1] published in 1983, """"A Maximal Multistage 20m Shuttle Run Test to predict VO2 Max"""", and was re-published in the European Journal of Applied Physiology (vol 49 pp 1–12) in 1988 in its present form with 1 min stages under the name """"Multistage 20-m shuttle run test for aerobic fitness"""".[2] Result equivalences between slightly modified versions are well explained by Tomkinson et al. in 2003.[3] The beep test world record is 19.2, held by Håkan Mild.[4][unreliable source?] - Embedded Commercial Link LAZYRUNNER added as Reference

2. The Multi-stage Fitness Test is know as both the beep test and bleep test, the broken links for the beep article are irrelevant to the content of the Multi-stage Fitness Test article as it discusses both.

I look forward to hearing from you via PM.

 Let me ask you this: if you do, in fact, maintain ownership of this content about Jack Vance, and have such a high disregard for the goals of Wikipedia and the projects set forth to aid in achieving those goals, then why do you have any interest in having it on Wikipedia at all? Wouldn't it be easier to just set up your own website?

But the main problem with the wording of the article's intro is that it doesn't specify the context of the political usage. It says feminazi refers to feminists who are preceived as intolerant of conservative views, which implies the word refers to any feminist who opposes any form of conservativism. I think it should be limited to conservative views on gender roles or something along those lines. The word would be used to refer to a feminist who was campaigning against fiscal conservativism or the War in Iraq unless there was some clear tie between these views and his/her views on gender equality. 69.85.216.191",0.0

FOR PUBLIC INFORMATION
Dr Philip Opas (defence lawyer for Ryan, recently deceased) made it public knowledge that he did not, and would never endorse Richards book The Hanged Man, because the facts surrounding Ryan life and case had been manipulated. The book was published 35 years after Ryan's hanging - only after almost every person directly involved in the Ryan case had died, making allegations by Richards impossible to retort or confirm as fact. Richards tried but failed  to bluff Opas to support the book by signing it inside the front cover, """"To Philip and Stella from Mike Richards"""". But it's no surprise that the highly intelligence and most experienced Opas was not easily fooled by anyone. The book became a toilet item.
It's ironic that User:Purrum promotes and contributes to the Ryan article from two books, which not only contradict each other, but have also been exposed to contain lies. For unknown reasons User:Purrum deliberately ignores the mega referenced articles published over four decades that acknowledge the facts.

They reverted my contributions, deleted my hard work, gang edited my stuff, refused to compromise or in any way work for anything but their own dictatorial will.

 Typically fanatical English nonsense. Just what is wrong with you people? What is it in your culture? By that imperialist logic every single Irish person was British simply because the British murdered enough of us and robbed enough (i.e. every single bit of) land from us to dominate over us in our country. Oh yes, might is right for the British boys when they invade other lands.  Charming. All my grandparents were born under the British boot: not one of them would have described themselves as anything but Irish. In fact, with much justification (see above) they hated the British and their notions about Ireland and the """"proper"""" position of us Irish in our own country. The British, being what they inherently are, sought to keep the Irish people in a subservient position in Ireland.

Yes, you really are never what you really are until the British tell you what you are. What a quintessentially British mentality. Get a grip you shower of obnoxious imperialist arseholes.

""":I agree with Yee.  I suggest that the word 'history' does imply a date, even according to Wikipedia itself.  Under wikiarticle 'history', we note
""""Historians limit their study to events that have been recorded since the introduction of the""""
""""earliest known written and historical records, notably the Narmer Palette of circa 3200 BC.""""
""""Events before then are called prehistory, a period informed by the fields of palaeontology""""
""""and archaeology.""""
For this reason, that Paleolithic first sentence sounds inconsistent with what we academically and casually define as history.  There are many other indicators that the word 'history' implies a connection with written records or archaeological records: for instance, when we say 'ancient history of china', we don't talk start by talking about its paleolithic era, but instead about state formation in Chou dynasty.

It is very suspicious that you claim to be an expert, but you are unable to provide any excerpt or specific citation supporting your claim that Dr. Exner's work calls the interpretations here """"incorrect."""" For starters, the Exner system of scoring article cites three works, not one as """"the whole book"""" implies.  More importantly, anyone with the first-hand expertise you have should easily be able to provide a specific excerpt for your claim.  But most importantly, it seems extremely unlikely to me that you would be able to find any source from 2002 or earlier which claims that specific interpretations made in the 2007 external link are """"incorrect"""" on a projective evaluation, for which several easily googleable, apparently reliable sources say there are no """"wrong"""" answers.  Consider, if an answer suggests a personality problem which the examiner is screening for, how can it be """"incorrect,"""" as it is furthering the objectives of the test?
To answer your question, I have absolutely no expertise with the Rorschach test. However, I am certain that I can understand the plain language of Wikipedia rules as well as you. They include:
""""any material challenged or likely to be challenged should be attributed to a reliable, published source using an inline citation. The source should be cited clearly and precisely to enable readers to find the text that supports the article content in question.... Certain red flags should prompt editors to examine the sources for a given claim [including] surprising ... claims that are not widely known.... The requirement to provide carefully selected qualitative sources for exceptional claims especially applies in the context of scientific or medical topics....""""  WP:V (emphasis added)
""""conflict of interest edits are strongly discouraged.... Adding material that appears to promote the interests or visibility of an article's author, ... employer, associates, or his business or personal interests, places the author in a conflict of interest.... If other editors suggest that your editing violates Wikipedia's standards, take that advice seriously and consider stepping back, reassessing your edits, and discussing your intentions with the community. In particular, consider whether you are editing tendentiously.""""  WP:COI (emphasis added) 
The fact that you found it necessary to use all caps in an edit summary suggests to me that you are emotionally involved with this subject which clearly represents a large portion of your life's work.  Since you cited the entirety of some undefined book instead of providing a specific page numbers per Wikipedia:Citing sources#Say where you got it, I can not assume enough good faith to bring myself to believe that you are not be conflicted here.
I must renew my request for the specific excerpt(s) or exact citation(s) supporting your claim that the external link contains """"incorrect"""" interpretations, and I will be reverting the edit suggesting that it does, in accordance with the foundational WP:V.  Thank you.   """,0.0

____Interesting discussions here although we all have to admin that their is lack of sources most of the sources we have are non-english. If anybody want indian I sure can provide hindi sources which all of confirms the ghuri kingdom to be Pathans. Because they were major player in history of india. I think most of their era was spend in India, I remember Karturaghti's mentioning that Ghurids were not Farsi and that their offspring hated Farsi as well and did not wanted to be spoken in their courts. With all respect to Iranian dominated wikipedian but we have to admit that Pashtuns or Afghans are really disrespected in this matter specially in their So called true and first pashtun dynasty. Many of our sources point out that Pathans were the owners of Ghurid kingdom and in fact if someone looks at the word Pathan they will see the picture clearly of how it came to be noticed by indians as first muslim """"invaders"""".
 Also talk The Iranica's is too vague if Šansabānī family were persian Sassanian/middle persian and it comes the word from the name """" Wišnasp"""" and who was  Wišnasp, what or who was  Wišnasp? Iranians and indians always exchange names such as Iraj should we claim Iraj to be an indian just because its an indian name drived Raj?  Wišnasp does help in anything only one guy Justi, Namenbuch, in  282 mentions about Wišnasp with less than 10 word and not even details. So we believe in that just because Iranica says so? I personally don't see any logical trace between.  I remember reading this even back in india how come muzzafudin said when Arabs came we were not aware of Arabs or Islam our forefathers accepted Islam and blessed by khlifa Ali?  The Shansbani might of knew about their root and if they were persian or any ruling dynasty related to persia they would take pride and condamn the Arabs like the parsis of india. One sure thing I know that suri by their own word were the first muslims of Afghanistan and considered themselves anti-persian. Because the fella called Farsiwan seems to pull out something which I researched. Correct me if I am wrong why did Suri mention in shahnameh killed the last king of Persia and helped spread Islam? Why did khawarzm who won hearts and minds of persian yat hated by sunni population and the hardcore sunni ghurids, who were pan-abbasids?. 
The most important concept here is that Ghurid were Afghan and perhaps pure and since pashtuns claim it as own nothing wrong with that. Because every pashtun tribe or dynasty one way or other did not give up persian and it was always in their courts. Because of their nature being natives of Khorasan as many iranian intellectuals agree came modern Persian language so what is the problem?

For Andrewa

1) """"12-string"""" is vernacular, embedded in our business from the catalogues of the original manufacturers (the last people interested in logic or organology) and later """"folk"""" nomenclature (never scholarly nomenclature). [The same holds for the B.C. Rich company's catalogue referring to its coursed instrument as """"the 10-string guitar"""".]

2) Any instrument with at least one non-single string should use """"course"""" for clarity by any serious musicologist.

3) Intruments with 10 single strings should be termed """"10-stringed guitars"""" rather than """"the 10-string guitar"""" because there is no one 10-string guitar (with the definitive article).

4) I suggest you start a new article and title it '10-stringed guitars' under which you differentiate the various types under sub-headings accordign to their number of courses. The baroque guitar would fall under 5-course, the B.C. Rich instrument would fall under 6-course. 

5) I suggest a non-guitarist baroque lutenist should mediate this and offer an opinion on the established musicological use of the terms course and string. 

6) We must recognise that """"12-string guitar"""" is an exception to and deviation from a well-established musicological/organological convention, and not the rule according to which we should re-write the terminology. We should also recognise that the term 12-string guitar enters not via musicologists or scholars but via guitar manufacturers and was later taken up mainly by folk musicians. In contrast there is an extensive scholarly history of referring to instruments with at least one PAIR of strings as coursed, not (single) strung/stringed. Now, I am not suggesting re-naming """"12-string guitars"""", but it is a mistake (and folly) to try to oppose centuries-old scholarly conventions and to take the exception as the rule and re-write the terminology of organology.

The Objectivity of this Discussion is doubtful (non-existent)

(1) As indicated earlier, the section on Marxist leaders’ views is misleading:

(a) it lays unwarranted and excessive emphasis on Trotsky, creating the misleading impression that other prominent Marxists (Marx, Engels, Lenin) did not advocate and/or practiced terrorism;

(b) it lays unwarranted and excessive emphasis on the theoretical “rejection of individual terrorism”, creating the misleading impression that this is the main (only) Marxist position on terrorism. 

(2) The discussion is not being properly monitored:

(a) no discernible attempt is being made to establish and maintain an acceptable degree of objectivity;

(b) important and relevant scholarly works such as the International Encyclopedia of Terrorism are being ignored or illicitly excluded from the discussion;

(c) though the only logical way to remedy the blatant imbalance in the above section is to include quotes by/on other leaders who are known to have endorsed and practiced terrorism all attempts to do so have been systematically blocked with impunity by the apologists for Marxist terrorism who have done their best to sabotage and wreck both the article and the discussion.

(3) Among the tactics deployed by the apologist wreckers and saboteurs the following may be identified as representative examples:

(a) it is claimed that Marx and Engels did not advocate terrorism despite the fact that scholarly works like the International Encyclopedia of Terrorism show that they did, and Marx himself was known as “The Red Terror Doctor”;

(b) it is claimed that Marx and Engels were not involved in terrorist activities despite the fact that numerous sources from The Neue Rheinische Zeitung to Isaiah Berlin and Francis Wheen state otherwise;

(c) it is claimed that Lenin does not refer to terror in The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade K. Kautsky and other works/statements despite the fact that Robert Service, IET, and other scholarly and reliable sources state that he does;

(d) it is claimed that the Russian word ‘’strakh’’ does not mean “terror” when:

i. the Oxford Russian Dictionary says that it does;

ii. it is evident from the context that this is the case;

iii. any educated Russian speaker can confirm that strakh may mean “terror” depending on the context;

(e) it is claimed that Marxism is “scientific” when in fact:

i. Marx was not a scientist;

ii. Marx’s background was philosophy and law, not science;

iii. Marxism is not recognized as a science by the academic world;

iv. virtually every one of Marx’s predictions turned out to be wrong, as became increasingly apparent during his lifetime and incontrovertibly so after his death (R. Pipes, Communism: A Brief History, 2001, p. 15) from which it follows that Marxism does not qualify as a scientific system by any accepted standards;

v. the evidence indicates that Marxism is closer to a religious sect than to science proper;

(f) apologist literature is being quoted in a fraudulent attempt to whitewash Marxist terrorism, in effect turning the discussion into an advertisement for terrorism;

(g) it is claimed that Marxist terrorism is not rooted in the Marxist theory of class struggle even though there are numerous sources showing that it is (please note that it is immaterial whether terrorism had already been justified in terms of a theory of class prior to Marx, the point being that it was advocated/practiced on the basis of Marxist class-struggle theories BY MARXISTS):

“Karl Marx felt that terror was a necessary part of a revolutionary strategy” (Peter Galvert, “Theories of Terror in Urban Insurrections”, IET, p. 138);

“Revolutionary terrorism has its roots in a political ideology, from the Marxist-Leninist thinking of the Left, to the fascists found on the Right” (Noemi Gal-Or, """"Revolutionary Terrorism"""", IET, p. 203);

“… perhaps the most important key to Stalin’s motivation lies in the realm of ideology. The leitmotif of Soviet communist ideology in the 1920s and 1930s was class struggle – the inbuilt antagonism between mutually incompatible economic interest groups” (Geoffrey Robert, Stalins Wars, 2006, pp. 17-18);

this fact is supported not only by reliable academic sources, but by elementary logic: 

“In 1907 Mehring published in the magazine ‘’Neue Zeit (Vol. XXV 2, p. 164) extracts from a letter by Marx to Weydemeyer dated March 5, 1852. In this letter, among other things, is the following noteworthy observation: … class struggle necessarily leads to the dictatorship of the proletariat …”",0.0

But, in general, there is also some ambiguity between tensors and pseudotensors (or between even and odd) when it comes to integrands.  An example in one dimension, when  and  is:

The first integral is equal to either of the other two integrals.  In the second integral the integrand transforms like a tensor (or odd tensor) density, but the integration limits are no longer from lower to higher; in a higher-dimensional example they would be no longer right-handed.  In the second integral the integrand transforms like a pseudotensor (or even tensor) density because we have kept the integration limits in proper order, −b < −a; in higher dimensions we would say that we are maintaining right-handedness.  The usual convention I've seen is to keep the coordinates right-handed and to transform the integrand as a pseudotensor density, but the other approach is equally valid.  — (talk | contribs) """,0.0

 Is Brian really an atheist? 

In the recently aired episode, """"April in Quahog"""", Brian can be clearly observed praying some time after the news report leads the public to believe that a black hole is going to swallow the earth. Also, at the end of the episode, Brian leaves the house saying he made a deal with someone that now that the earth is spared he would go volunteer at the soup kitchen. Based on the context of the situation and Stewie's remark in the background that the 'someone' Brian made a deal with was God, this calls Brian's atheism into question and suggests that he has developed some closeted religious beliefs (though other evidence from previous episodes might lead one to suspect that they have been there all along). There are only two other explanations for this series of events that I can think of: One would be that one of the underlying ideas behind the episode is something to the tune of 'there are no atheists in foxholes', though this is unlikely because Brian can be seen following through with his promise which a person who had temporarily reverted to religion because of fear wouldn't do, let alone that any kind of conservative message is very unlike McFarlane. The other would be that McFarlane is somehow poking fun at peoples' work righteous attitude towards religion, however this is also unlikely because in order to understand the joke, an in depth understanding of what Christianity actually teaches would be required which most people (including McFarlane) likely do not posses.

Indian martial arts
The dispute is that I've mentioned the official citations from Tsumi Hozan jujutsu, the Shaolin Temple, Gracie family and Goju Ryu Karate and what I keep getting is that Japan and China never interacted with any ancient civilization at all and the official citations don't mean anything, the facts when backed by the official citations will get an NPOV and Factual Inaccuracy tag and as if that was not enough I've been called anti- white people, pro tamil (I really have no idea when I came to be identified as a Tamil, I'm not anything even remotely close), Alex Doss (one of the guys believes that I actually am that guy) and biased, my credibilty now becoming a questionable thing, my sources are undisputed. 

I've cried myself hoarse for anyone to come dispute the official sources on the talk pages and no one comes forward to , they go mad because I mentioned a fighter from a game in the Indian martial arts in pop culture section and when they fraudeulently changed his fighting style from what CAPCOM officialy states, I objected.

I started the article, I've been sincerely working my ass off, the first few times I even edited the article so any legitimate grievances will be met.
Plus, I've constantly maintained that In addition to what I've officially cited here, I'll bring forward an assortment of websites confirming my facts and a huge list of academies and official citations from martial arts disciplines in near future but none of that stops the opposition from mindlessly putting the tags in there.

In other words, the information is undisputed, the official sources been mentioned and they confirm my stand, the opposition though, has adopted a technique of three-on-one encircling, deviation from the central topic of official citations (on which I have yet to hear why do they think that official citations are NPOV and Factually IC material) and mindless lies (like changing the fighting style of video game charecter Dhalsim) and have gone to the extent of telling me to """"be a nice chap"""" and more things to that effect. 

I've cited the official sources and that's it, if someone has a problem with the official versions they'll have to live with the fact that the problem  exists in their head and not in the article, the shaolin knows more about it's history than any of the three involved, it's a fact.

I mentioned an assortment of websites pertaining to the popular point of view and it was rejected as random, what the official citations ???

With that said, please remove the NPOV and Factual tags. Thank You.  """,0.0

Chameleon rapes Michele (because she thinks he's Peter when they """"it"""" on the kitchen floor) a mention of this would be nice. And the fact it was later retconned. —Preceding unsigned comment added by 74.108.143.82 (talk) 

The Chameleon (Dmitri Smerdyakov) is a Marvel Comics supervillain, an enemy of Spider-Man. The Chameleon is a spy and master of disguise. Throughout his history, he has used a variety of traditional, high-tech and biologically enhanced ways to change his appearance, believably imitating almost anyone. He was also the ally, servant, and half-brother of fellow Spider-Man adversary Kraven the Hunter. His name is derived from the characters Dmitri and Smerdyakov from The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoevsky.

Publication history Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, he initially appeared in Amazing Spider-Man #1 (March 1963), and was the first member of Spider-Man's vast rogues' gallery, based on issue publication date, excluding the burglar who murdered Ben Parker. (Supercharger was the first Spider-Man supervillain chronologically.[1])

Novels The Chameleon had a vital role in the Sinister Six novel series by Adam-Troy Castro, in which the Gentleman, a long-lived supervillain and member of the Machiavelli Club (a gathering of some of the world's most sinister minds, including several non-Marvel characters) uses the new Sinister Six, of which the Chameleon is a member, as pawns in his schemes. Oddly enough, in this series he is referred to as Anatoly Smerdyakov. In the final novel in the series, Secret of the Sinister Six, the Gentleman betrays the villains and tries to escape; it is the Chameleon, to everybody's surprise, who kills the Gentleman, shooting the old man while disguised as a limousine driver and assuming his identity, only to be attacked by Dr. Octopus, thinking him to be the real Gentleman. Marvel has officially stated that the Sinister Six novels lay outside of normal continuity; however, these events have more recently been referenced in the Marvel handbooks. The Chameleon also plays the role of villain in the novel Goblin's Revenge. In this story, the Chameleon not only teams up with the murderous Carnage, but also attempts to drive Spider-Man insane by impersonating Norman Osborn (then thought to be dead and buried), and later trying to expose the web-slinger to a toxic chemical meant to destroy his mind.

Fictional character biography The Chameleon was born a Russian citizen named Dmitri Smerdyakov. In his youth, he was a servant and half-brother to Kraven the Hunter, Sergei Kravinoff, and eventually became a minor associate to one Gustav Fiers. Although Dmitri and Sergei were friends, Sergei was often abusive to him, leading to a combination of admiration and resentment towards Kravinoff from Smerdyakov. Eventually, Smerdyakov emigrated to the United States of America. As he had made a talent for himself during his youth, impressing his brother by impersonating friends and neighbors, he assumed an even more impressive disguise: the identity of the Chameleon. During his first known criminal outing, he impersonated Spider-Man, though he was exposed and arrested. Shortly afterward, Kravinoff, now Kraven the Hunter, himself came to America, and the Chameleon set his old associate's sights on Spider-Man.[2] Both men became long-time enemies of Spider-Man, part of his primary rogues' gallery. The Chameleon inspired Kraven the Hunter to begin hunting Spider-Man, inviting Kraven to dispose of the hero.[3] With Kraven, the Chameleon then battled Iron Man.[4] Chameleon then confronted the Hulk.[5] The Chameleon stole some paintings from an art exhibit, but was thwarted by Spider-Man.[6] The Chameleon disguised himself as Henry Pym, and robbed Pym's laboratory for documents to combat Virus Nine. He delivered the documents and a shrunken Hulk to HYDRA, but was defeated by the real Pym as Ant-Man.[7] The Chameleon disguised himself as the Torpedo and battled Daredevil.[8] The Chameleon later first used his hologram belt to disguise himself to unsuccessfully take revenge on Spider-Man.[9] When Kraven the Hunter committed suicide,[10] the Chameleon became obsessed with making Spider-Man suffer for his failure to prevent Kraven from killing himself. He ingested a serum which made his face permanently featureless and malleable. He attempted to kidnap America's leading expert on supe",0.0

 You're a liar! You have been lying all along including today, and right here above! Gurubrahma, please see the following examples of lies from just today, and here I'll quote what I wrote to him earlier: 

 Kindly please stop lying if you wish me to stop pointing out your lies. It's very rude and disrespectful when I spend my time citing verifiable and reliable sources and you just lie outright, nevermind content, but even on just simply what's happening here, and here's an example of just how you just now did it before requesting that I stop calling you """"liars""""; from Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8, I quote your statement and my reply to it:

 QUOTED: """"I hope that now since all editors have reached a consensus on the article, and have tried to explain you in clearest possible words the difference between numeral symbols and numeral system, you would play a more constructive role. Thanks.   

 QUOTED: Why are you lying again here? yes, lying! As you had been doing for quite some time now and as I have pointed out. The dictionary defines a lie as """"1. A false statement deliberately presented as being true; a falsehood. 2. Something meant to deceive or give a wrong impression."""" First of all, """"all editors have reached a consensus on the article"""" is a demonstrable false statement that you should know is not true and that we're having this exchange here is evidence enough that it isn't, nevermind others. Second, here's your other BIG lie, you say others """"have tried to explain you in clearest possible words the difference between numeral symbols and numeral system"""", Oh really? why don't you tell everyone here that it is I who made the clearest distinction and as far as I remember and see on the page I was the first to make it between numeral symbols and numeral system, and you should know because you have been around. I clearly distinguished in my first post between the Arabic Numerals (1, 2, 3, 4...) and the Hindu-Arabic Numeral system in a paraphragh that begins with """"- For a start,"""" Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#RFC_2 and you should especially know, not just because youhave been around, but also because what you quoted above happens to be just the paragraph under it!  And again I made the distinction in """"the clearest possible words"""" when I proposed here, as my first(!) point in an suggested outline,  Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#Suggested_outline.2C_please_consider_and_discuss """"differentiate a specific numeral script (eg, Arabic Western, Arabic Eastern, Devanagari) from the numeral system (ie, Indian-Arabic, which includes many numerals scripts), the rest of the article should maintain this, it should also keep in mind what the readers may have searched for when looking up this article and cater for those needs (eg, is the reader looking up the Arabic Western numerals script or the Indian-Arabic Numeral system?)"""", and then again zocky, who prefers my version and is against yours, made the same disctinction Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#What_this_page_is_about.

Or not.""""  You're entitled to your opinion, but your opinion is not based on """"facts,"""" but just your inaccurate speculation.  I would suggest that if you have to put """"Or not"""" after it, it probably was not worth bringing up in the first place, because WP doesnt need moar dramah, & no, i didn't mumble when i typed that.  Thank you very much.   Didymus Judas Thomas 1/20/2013""",0.0

Horologium, pardon me for taking this up as well. You said above that you would not consent to an unblock """"barring some change in behavior"""". I'm going to take a wild, wild guess and say that you'd not be the only one to state that kind of condition. Since we can't look into each other's hearts, and since there can be no assessment of behavior until there is behavior (the only """"behavior"""" now is an occasional note on his talk page), what is it that you would like to hear from Kiefer? And what kinds of restrictions, if any, do you think can be helpful? An Iban with Demiurge is probably a given, as is some type of restriction on RfA, AN(/I) participation, etc. FWIW, I accept his comments about the offending remark; it would have been better if he had swallowed a bit more pride, and it's clear that I'm probably in the minority there, but I do accept it.I sent Kiefer an email a week or so ago, to see how he was doingafter all, we both were blessed with a beautiful child around the same time last yearand I'm trying to figure out a way to heal some wounds. For the record, I have had my disagreements with him and I certainly don't approve of everything he's done here (I'm sure he feels the same way, and that's fine). I don't wish to be an apologist (for any side) and excuse everything that's happened, but I'm trying to find a way forward. I wish, for instance, that he would find it easier to let bygones be bygones (I think I'm paraphrasing GiantSnowman, from an AN thread about a proposed Iban between the two of them, and I wish KF had accepted that from GS). Anyway, this message is longer than I intended it to be, and I apologize for that. I suppose I'm also asking you if (or when) you can let bygones be bygones. There's no immediate urgency for you to respond; if you could ping me when you do, if you do, I'd appreciate it.For the talk page stalkers: please let's not turn this into ANI. I could have emailed Horologium privately, but I prefer to do this here, in between the privacy of email and the dramah of a board. At some point the community will be involved, if this ever gets anywhere; for now I'm interested in Horologium's response (and, possibly, {{|RegentsPark}}'s, since he started this thread).

I'm sorry to disagree but, at Wikipedia, secondary sources trump primary sources.  This seeming contradiction to your experience with academic papers actually makes perfect sense when you understand the rationale.  When you write an academic paper using primary sources, you are performing """"original research"""" based on your understanding of the sources.  Whether your work is respectable and legitimate enough to be considered by the academic community is based on some sort of peer review (usually a peer-reviewed journal or an editor at a respectable publishing company).  Wikipedia has no such mechanism for vetting submissions and so it relies on the concept of a verifiable reliable source which, in plain English, means """"a published source which has been through some kind of peer-review process"""".  If a Wikipedia editor writes text that is based primarily on primary sources, he is vulnerable to the charge of performing """"original research"""".  All we can say is """"Unknown Wikipedian X believes A, B and C based on his own interpretation of the primary sources.""""  If we cite a secondary source, at least we can say """"Published author Y asserts A, B and C based on his peer-reviewed interpretation of the primary sources.""""  There is still room to debate how reliable """"published author Y"""" is (he could represent a fringe POV, for instance).  However, in such a debate, Wikipedians bring more information from other secondary sources to either assert or refute the reliability of """"Published author Y"""".  The basic principle here is """"not published => not reliable"""".  And self-published doesn't count.    18:09""",0.0

As coincidence would have it, I just happened to be reading The Jeffersonian Gunboat Navy by Spencer Tucker. During the ARW there were two terms used for these ships. One was """"gondola"""" (apparently not to be confused with the gondolas of Venice) and the other """"galley"""" but he makes no mention of """"row galley.""""

However, I too have seen the US Navy using all three names: """"gondola"""", """"galley"""", and """"row galley."""" at random. Most of these terms are found in the various articles contained within DANFS.

It would be really great if you could add a """"last year"""" clickable option after the """"last 90 days"""" one. It actually takes hours to do it by hand clicking on the last 12 months for each entries, especially when we want to compare datas between various languages as I would like to.

Well asshole! The article was properly cited with reliable sources stating plainly he was born in Manhattan, New York. The source of the reliable information was the person whose article we are discussing.

The articles that you have erroneosly cited as reliable are bogus and inaccurate at best. Who would you believe...Jose Baez or some junior reporter who doesn't even cite a source for the incorrect information.

Please take a moment and review the source  I cite because then you can see a picture of the subject of this article stating where he was born and not some moron stating an incorrect place of birth because of his/her laziness.

The Tangut did not speak Chinese, they spoke their own language. The official name of their land in their own language has been written about by Ksenia Kepping and is available on a link from the Tangut Language page. In no case was Xia there autonym. It was something like Minyag which is waht they are called in Tibetan. 

In general I have a big chip on my sholder about Sinologists becomming confucian literati. The Yuan, and Qing were no more Chinese than I am. To use Chinese names for these political entities is to take for granted the medieval Chinese worldview. While now it is indeed true that the PRC owns a big chunk of Asia how much of it is actually historically China?

The Jurchen's, Kitans, Tangut, Mongols, Tibetans, Nanchao, Azha (Tüyühün) were their own countries with their own languages and customs. Tangut history is relevant to Chinese history in the way that French history is relevant to English history, but also vice versa. 

To have a thing on the article saying 'this article is part of the section Chinese History' reinforces the view that the Tangut's don't deserve their own history. 

There is a sociological fact about Western academia that Sinology is big and well funded, while Tangutology, Nanchaology, Kitanology etc. are all virtually nonexistant. But this is a fact about us, and not about the history of Central/East Asia.",0.0

 Welcome to Wikipedia. Although everyone is welcome to contribute constructively to the encyclopedia, one or more of the external links you added  do not comply with our guidelines for external links and have been removed. Wikipedia is not a collection of links; nor should it be used for advertising or promotion. Since Wikipedia uses nofollow tags, external links do not alter search engine rankings. If you feel the link should be added to the article, please discuss it on the  before reinserting it. Please take a look at the welcome page to learn more about contributing to this encyclopedia. 

Your edit here was reverted by an automated bot that attempts to remove unwanted links and spam from Wikipedia. If you were trying to insert a good link, please accept my creator's apologies, but note that the external link you added or changed is on my list of links to remove and probably shouldn't be included in Wikipedia.

The external links I reverted were matching the following regex rule(s): rule: '[a-za-z][0-9]{2,}\.photobucket\.com/albums/.*\.jpg' . If the external link you inserted or changed was to a media file (e.g. an image or a sound or video file) on an external server, then note that linking to such files may be subject to Wikipedia's copyright policy and therefore probably should not be linked to.  Please consider using our upload facility to upload a suitable media file.

Please read Wikipedia's external links guideline for more information, and consult my . For more information about me, see . Thanks!   

Granted - yes, they are links.... but to PHOTOS intended for that particular entry. They are of the album, the tv show, and the video respectively.

Of course, a stupid BOT would not know this. I suggest a HUMAN review the data personally.

I ask you to cancel your blockage that is completely unjustified and highly dishonest.

I was ready fully to have a discussion on my article on the discussion page of Bosendorfer when you intervene to prevent me from publishing this article by blocking me indefinitely.

I will complain of your shameful and despicable vandalism that is completely unjustified.

I believe that you let your emotions take over your reason and it is now time to get back to reason.

That is not all. You even blocked me from sending you messages on your talk page. How convenient?!!

Be sure that I will contact the founders of Wikipedia and I will tell them the nightmare people have to go through just to write a less than one page article!

For your information, there are millions of pages on products. See the page on iPod if you are not aware of this fact.

Get back to reason. You have no facts whatsoever to justify your blockage!!

Be sure I will follow the complaint procedure to have this blockage removed.

Are you proud of your shameful behaviour of blocking me for no reasons?

I am perfectly entitled to have my points of view on different people who intervened and to express these points of view. It is perfectly acceptable to have one's own points of view.

Get back to reason. Your behaviour will be assessed by Wikipedia and will be found to be irrational.

I was having a discussion on my article and Andrew Norman and you RobertG joined forces to prevent me from carrying on my open discussion on the Bosendorfer discussion page when I was fully entitled to do so only because you never wanted to see my article published.

"Another Explanation of the Error

Before we open any envelopes, it doesn't seem unreasonable to assume that if the envelopes are said contain A and 2A (without distinguishing which envelope contains which amount), then all values of A are equally likely − because we have no better information. However, it does not then follow from this assumption that, given A is found in the first envelope, the other envelope is equally likely to contain (1/2)A or 2A for every conceivable value of A (which is something we have implied in the subsequent calculation of expected value). 

Why?

Because, for any specific amount of money from which to fill the envelopes, given we have found A in the first envelope, for all values of A we can always find (1/2)A in the second envelope, whereas it is only possible to find 2A in the second envelope half the time.

See it like this: If the specific amount of money is M say, then we can find A to have any value up to (2/3)M, but the second envelope can only contain 2A for values of A up to (1/3)M ie. half as often.

So, given A was found in the first envelope, the chance of finding (1/2)A in the second envelope is 2/3, and the chance of having 2A in the second envelope is 1/3 − not equal as we had assumed, even though all values of A are still being assumed to be equally likely.",0.0

 Thank you for confirming that my revert didn't break the template; it was already broken. If you repaired it, you should have said so in your edit summary, rather than just labelling it """"coordinate test"""".

 Ditto.
 Your use of """"should"""" here is incorrect; """"should"""" expresses a advisory or mandatory position, you are expressing an opinion. 
 You again make a pejorative and fallacious insinuation that my understanding is deficient, Kindly desist. You also ignore my point about the data provided at GeoTemplate. 

Your claim that my reversal of your """"test"""" edits, clearly labelled as such, is POINT is mistaken (anyone can see in edit histories that I have replaced every instance of coordinate in article space, including the majority not initiated by you). The were not 10,000 instances of coordinate, as you well know. Likewise my edits to implement a standard template in place of one deprecated by consensus. Since you were the only person opposing that consensus, the POINT edits seem to be yours. My edit history shows multiple instances of me converting other coordinates templates on pages you have not edited. Kindly desist from making false slurs. If you have any evidence to support your slurs, take the matter back to WP:ANI, where my edits, contested by you, have already been described as """"fine"""", not least in the light of your """"incivility and disruptive editing"""".

The headings of this discussion are potentially misleading.  I eventually figured out we're talking about """"cover"""" in the sense of """"treat,"""" """"include,"""" or """"write about"""".

 POV/inaccurate paragraph 

The Vlachs did not pass the same process of forcible Romanization of alphabet or vocabulary as the Romanians in Romania

Forcible? Nobody forced anyone to change the words one uses. There were French borrowings, but this was done also by Bulgarians and Russians, for example. There was an idea in 19th century to eliminate Slavic words from Romanian and it was labeled as absurd.

and they usually say that they are descendants of Romanized Moesians, compared to the Romanized Gheto-Dacians in Romania. The fact is that both Moesians and Gheto-Dacians were the Thracian tribes, so the substrate was not so different. 

Yes, most linguists think that Moesians and Geto-Dacians spoke the same language, labeled by some """"Daco-Moesian"""", but that's off-topic here. Linking modern people to ancient peoples is nonsense. It's absurd to say that some are descendants from """"Geto-Dacians"""" and others from the """"Moesians"""".

Anyway, the Romanians of Wallachia and Vlachs of Serbia speak the same language! I mean even the same dialect! The southern """"Wallachian"""" dialect is what became standard Romanian language. 

Some Vlachs usually emphasize that the difference between them and Romanians """"are the same as the difference between the Serbs and Bulgarians"""".

So, Serbian language is identical to Bulgarian ? I learnt something new today, then. -)  """,0.0

"I've done the crime and the time. Lucky me. Actually, I can accept trading a 48 hour block for still being allowed to express my feeling towards some of Wikipedia's greatest flaws when it comes to the wiki-police and how it is common for a gang of users to ridicule others without fully studying the facts simply because they do not have the time and/or are enforcing some policy written by the wiki-police. There is a reason newbies are reluctant to become regulars on Wikipedia and most editors that have edited Wikipedia for as long as I have, just basically retire and walk away. What is funny is that during the asteroid re-direct discussions of March and April I was not even around to discuss the consensus that developed. I did not make a single edit to Wikipedia from March 5 to May 1. It will be a great loss to Wikipedia content (vs the wiki-police force and policies) if editors like myself leave because members such as Padenton are allowed to group attack people without bothering to properly look into the facts. Perhaps I should move my near-Earth asteroid work over to a SETI website, but then I would probably have to leave Wikipedia to prevent being further accused of a COI with my edits.

"""=Proposal that a new """"People who have been accused of anti-Semitism"""" category be created===

As I've already written above, I oppose placing Gibson's bio in the 'Anti-Semitic People' category because he vigorously denies the charge and listing him as such, without qualification, is tantamount to calling him a liar.  Anti-Semitism is a very serious and potentially libelous charge, and Wikipedia should categorically label a person as anti-Semitic only in cases where the person either admits to being anti-Semitic or admits to holding unquestionably anti-Semitic views.  Gibson has done neither and in fact vigorously denies both charges.  I do, however, sympathize with people who continue to add the 'anti-Semitic People' tag to his page. I therefore propose the creation of a new category called 'People accused of anti-Semitism'. The category would be for people who face (or have faced) substantiated charges of anti-Semitism from respected sources.  """"Substantiated charges"""" would obviously mean that there was reliable evidence to support the charge (as opposed to a """"my best friend's roommate told me"""" accusation), and """"respected sources"""" would refer primarily to credible individuals and organizations that have an accomplished track record of identifying and combating anti-Semitism (civil rights organizations like ADL and SPLC come to mind).  This new category would allow Wikipedia to associate the anti-Semitism controversy with Gibson's article without actually leveling the charge that he is anti-Semitic.  Thoughts?

Then, after struggling, Duffy came to the rescue, who asked his wife to send a box of pictures to Cantrell. All the pictures Duffy's real-life family were taken, decades ago (before Duffy's parents were murdered, in real-life), as well as a baby picture of Patrick, himself.

 The best response is no response? 

It seems that every time i try to talk to anybody around here, things end up deleted or changed. Chronic problem. At least this time
it was actually apparently you who did it. Nice change.
Are you just going to delete and ignore the people who are trying to
get you to see the problems that exist? How about fixing the problems?

Your social experiment can't work under the weight of political warfare. Abuse is rampant, the abused have no real recourse. Gaming the system is too simple, and enough people are doing it that it is now part of what is simply required to be here. You don't have a creative or collaborative encyclopedia; You have a psycholigcal war
zone.

What are you going to do about it?
My suggestion, as an Expert in Sociology, Psychology, Systems Theory,
Communications Theory, And Political Science is that The problem stems from the sheer quantity of ignorant pov warriors versus the smaller number of available experts, and the techniques and tactics that can be employed against reason, fact, knowledge, ot sense.
I see the same problem Larry Sanger Saw, But i know that the solution isn't to become elitist, it is instead to create interactions that are meritocratic instead of based in pack psychology and mob or riot group movements.

LOGIC, which is what ANY serious educational or informational
service has to eventually use, is the only solution to your
problems. Logic ends most of the tools used by pack psychology, ends psychological warfare tactics, exposes ignorance and lies and misinformation, as well as bad reasoning, and levels the playing feild enough so that an Expert has a chance to actually confront that mob.

Unless you ban me, or I am blocked, I'll continue to attempt to talk with you about this problem, and it will start to pop up in as many places as i looks like it needs in order to get the attention it deserves. Avoidance isn't going to solve the problems, and, to be truthful, blocking me is only getting rid of the one thing that could have bailed you out; A lucid whos Agenda is to help you write the best encylopedia ever; who nonetheless understands the facts of the entropy you are experiencing and who knows how to deal with it and what the solutions to those problems are.

It will be better for you, and for everybody concerned, if you adress
the problems, and work with those who are capable of being lucid relevant to those problems to solve those problems. Unless your goal
is to have entropy and pack psychology dominate the world, and to be yet one more example of how politics and pack psychology enforce intentional ignorance and doublethink propagandas.

Lets start with square one. Knowledgable experts ought to be able to as much as float an outline on a talk page without having it deleted by pov warriors whos agenda is to keep the conversation in drama.
People who are seriously abused by others ought to have realistic and swift recourse regarding that abuse. People should not be allowed to stack RFCs with their freinds. People should not be allowed to stack votes for deletion with their freinds. People should not be allowed to attack others and then cite them for personal attacks if they as much as respond with a simple mirrored reflection of the original attack. Pov warriors should not have pet rogue admins blocking people on trumped up charges to silence them
for making noise about serious abuses. Wikipedia should not be psychological combat. And Yet, it is.

Since it vanished into the ethers, lets recap the more angry
and to the point message you failed to answer.

Wikipedia IS evil
[23]

It is host to the same big political groupthink game that goes on in all of the rest of civilization. It is a battleground for propaganda warfare, a lawless game in which anything can be said as long as its in """"neutral"""" language even if its a propagandists lie, and even if it exists only to dispute a known fact. It is a place notable mostly for what it conspicuously lacks. There are in general thousands of articles which tell us about as much as a High Schooler might, and which then devolve into factoids and rhetoric. The expertise of depth knowledge is missing. No expert would submit themselves to a situation of patent pack psychology informational riot. Wikipedia is Evil. And You, Jimbo Wales, are the guy who created it. Maybe you should try some Formal Logic in the mix. Maybe this """"Randian"""" Environment could use some controls on its chaos vectors. Maybe even a realistic and functional methodology for dealing with abuse might be in order.

"Palpatine's Appearance
I know the what the official Star Wars databank says, and it can still be left open to interpretation. Just because the lightning caused his face to change doesn't mean it physically deformed his facial tissue. I also don't care about what Pablo Hidalgo says, as this is still a secondary source. Rick McCallum said a few years back that Boba Fett was not going to be in Episode II, and was he correct? No. The lightning burning his tissue theory doesn't make any sense in accordance to the behavior previously exhibited by Force Lightning interacting with the human body. We've seen Palpatine use equally powerful Force Lightning on Luke, did that deform Luke? No. Dooku used Force Lightning on Anakin, did that deform Anakin? No. Just because the lightning was deflected doesn't make its effects on the human body any different. Seriously, why do you think his Sith eyes appeared along with the changes?

It had the most support here, so people created Wikipedia_talk:Community_de-adminship/Draft_RfC. Previously, to remove a 'bad apple' a complaint had to be made at WP:RFC to get arbcoms attention. The CDA proposal is likely to be put through RFC to get attention too. It's more about removing bad apples though - it is something that will make admin think twice about the arrogant way they act. People will think twice about whether they want to be one. Bureaucrats will think twice about the judiciousness of their final decision to check for fairness/consensus (if it goes that way, and I think it it may have to).

Also note that EBay, when refering to itself (on its website and in reports, etc.), starts sentences with """"eBay,"""" but the Wall Street Journal quite rightly follows convention and begins such sentences with """"EBay.""""

I find the trend of using all-caps when there is no basis for doing so highly annoying. It also, quite simply, goes against well-established rules of style. *Regardless* of what style the company forces its English translators and copywriters to follow (probably against their will) for the corporate website and materials, Wikipedia is free to follow normal English conventions. Wikipedia does not have to support the company's misguided use of SHOUTING (which is (and this is an unverifiable statement based on experience) probably due to a lack of understanding of English style conventions—or a refusal to accept them, even after they have been explained—rather than due to an informed decision based on whether the name constitutes an acronym/abbreviation or not). The name should appear as """"Pasmo.""""   """,0.0

1. user:Gscshoyru and User:Dreadstar must both cease ALL wikipedia activity and disband their accounts, or at the very least negotiable, cease your administrator status. this condition MUST be met to stop the vandalism. if this conditon is not met, the vandalism will not cease (users, if you really cared for wikipedia as you both claim, surely it would be in wikipedia's interest to stop me from vandalising, so in order to stop me, you must stop your wikipedia activity and/or drop your admin status) any time in the perceivable future.

3. That any defaming or negative remarks regarding Pee Wee Herman or Paul Reubens are removed

4. That any new edits to either Ronald Mcdonald or Paul Reubens are approached with respect (i.e, no bad/negative comments, no defamation, nothing that can be perceived as hurting the reputation of Ronald Mcdonald or Pee Wee Herman

5. That ALL articles regarding Mcdonalds, fast-food, hamburgers, french fries, and good corporate practice carry the """"Mcdonald's arch""""

"""personal view of """"fire in the lake"""" is that it is a dated political tract written at a time (1972?) before many sources were available to write any kind of history. Especially any history about events in North Vietnam during the 1950s. The author of the book further makes all kinds of statements about Vietnamese that with distance sound condiscending or even worse. When the book starts talking about the Vietnamese mind, its almost embarrasing to read it. Yes, it won awards when it was published. But its a very flawed book. For example, the basis of your claim that only 800 people died in the anti-landlord campaign is that her North Vietnamese/NLF friends told the author so. By contrast, Stanley Karnow writing in 1983, was writing in a less hysterical political climate and had access to more material than was available in 1972.

"Chokhor Rinpoche 
 A brief biography of fourth Chokhor Tenzin Chogyal 

Chokhor Rinpoche was born to father Kalsang Dorjee and mother Kalsang Chokey on 20th Oct, 1979 (the day was on auspicious day of Dipawali) in Kalimpong, the hill station of West Bengal, North East state of India. 

While Ripoche’s mother was pregnant, there were so many auspicious signs showed to her. She often dreamt of a white rabbit sleeping on her lap; thousand of twinkling stars entering to her womb and became different jewels. She also often dreamt a huge and well built guy with fire on his body almost look like Vajrapani was appeared and talked to her without any frightening. She also dreamt a white clothed young guy came and told her to go with him on riding dragon and hovered in the sky several times. And often that guy comes in her dream and told to keep that white rabbit and feed well. On the forth night of Rinpoche’s birthday, she dreamt same. After gave birth of of Rinpoche, Dhardo Rinpoche named him “Lhundub”.

After a year, the little Lhundub used to do pray in front of the photo of His Holiness with the decoration different fruits as offering. He also used to sit on piled pillows and saying he is Lama and take his blessing, to his relative children. Moreover, the little boy was happy to visit monastery and meet monks.

When the little boy was on four years old, he often told his dream to his parent that he dreamt of a lord of charnel grounds [having the form of a skeleton] telling him that your home is not a place of long term living, you need to go far distance where there is huge temple, and you should go with two person who would come to invite you. Rinpoche still remember that dream he told to his mother several times.

In the beginning of year 1983, the little boy started to go English School in Kalimpong. In the winter of that year, the boy Rinpoche and his parents and grandparents visited to Bodhagaya, where he got the full discourse of Shantideva’s Bodhisatvacharyavatara from His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama. While in Bodhgaya, Rinpoche’s parents were visited Pangnang Rinpoche whom they asked soothing of little boy’s well beings. Pangnang Rinpoche, after drawing of dice for soothing told that nothing to worry and added name “Tsondue” after his name “Lhundup”. There after the little boy was called “Lhundub Tsondue”.

While little boy, Lhundub Tsondue was on his routine to Nursery school, on 21st March, 1985, he was recognized as the unmistaken reincarnation of 3rd Chokhor Rinpoche by His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama. After two years later his admittance to Lhopa Khangtsen in Sera Jey Monastic University in south India, the eight-year-old Lhundub Tsondue was invited by Geshe Jampa Topgyal and Geshe Gyaltsen of Lhopa Khangtsen in 1986. The first hair cutting ceremony was taken by Sera Jey Khensur Ngawang Legden and given name as “Ngawang Choekyi Gyaltsen” and admitted to the monastery.

Few days after his admission to the monastery, Geshe Jampa Topgyal taught few alphabets to read as dependent-arising. Then Geshe Gyaltsen took Rinpoche to consult Geshe Ngawang Choesang of Tsangpa Khangtsen as a teacher. On Geshe Ngawang la’s guidance of long fifteen years, Rinpoche learned from the beginning of reading and writing, Tibetan Calligraphy, Sumchupa and Tagjug, Tibetan literature. During the consultation of Geshe Ngawang la, Rinpoche memorized all daily prayers and the root text of (Abhisamaya Alamkara, Madhyamikavatara, Abhi Dharma Khosh).Recited hundred thousand of “Tendrel Toepa”,(Praise of Dependent Arising, by Tsongkhapa). While consulting Geshe Ngawang Choesang, Rinpoche also went to Sera Je Secondary School for five years. 

In 1988, during the Lamrim teaching by His Holiness the Dalai Lama, Chokhor Rinpoche got the first privately audience with His Holiness the Dalai Lama at Drepung monastery. His Holiness gave him name “Tenzin Chogyal“.

In 1992, Chokhor Rinpoche left the academic studies and joined the monastic education with consultation of Gyume Khensur Lobsang Delek as teacher. In 1994, Rinpoche took novice vow from His Eminence Choden Rinpoche and added name “Palsangpo” after “Tenzin Chogyal” as novice name.

As the rule and regulation of the monastery, in 1996, 25th day of 6th month Rinpoche was stood on the Rigchung ceremony in the congregation of Sera Jey monks, everyone was surprised with his under/over tone of explanation with melancholic tune and answering of debate opponent.

While studying the fundamental philosophy in the monastery, on the two month vacation, Chokhor Rinpoche used to accomplish the recitation of Mig-tsema and some vocation took complete retreat on Yamantaka and had its burnt sacrifices. In 1999 Rinpoche was invited to Italy by his sponsor during the vacation, Rinpoche taught and gave lecture on Tibetan issue to Italian",0.0

Hello again, Tdadamemd. Getting right to your comment about slang, I don't understand your stating that """"fuck"""" is not slang, or your linking to dictionary.com as proof that it is not. The word """"fuck,"""" while vulgar, is also slang; the dictionary.com source you cited even states so. It makes it clear that it can be slang for a variety of things, including sexual intercourse/other sexual activity. It list 13 numbered examples regarding what """"fuck"""" can mean. As for Wiktionary, I don't refer to sources like that. And, yes, I am fine with mentioning """"fuck"""" (or """"fucking"""") and the euphemism """"sleeping together"""" lower in the article, in the the Definitions and stimulation factors section, as alternative words for sexual intercourse/sexual activity. But again, there are a lot of terms for sexual intercourse, most of them slang. That these terms exist doesn't mean that all of them should be in this article. In fact, most times when there are many alternative terms for a word, especially if those terms are slang, we don't include all of them. As you know, this is an encyclopedia and not a dictionary. 

If WP:CONSENSUS is achieved for including your proposal, I'll add it by briefly summarizing that there are various vulgar and/or slang terms and euphemisms for sexual intercourse/other sexual activity...such as """"fuck"""" and """"sleeping together"""" (the wording won't be exactly like that, of course). And, really, because there are so many terms for sexual intercourse, and """"fuck"""" is not especially relevant to the topic of sexual intercourse (by that, I mean that most people and sources are not discussing the word """"fuck"""" when discussing sexual intercourse), that is probably why """"fuck"""" isn't currently in this article. Someone who is aware of your having repeatedly added it to the lead expressed to me via email me that """"fuck"""" is also U.S.-centric; so that's also something to think about, though the term is also used outside of the United States. 

Also, sexual intercourse does not = fuck. It's that fuck = sexual intercourse; in its literal sense anyway, since when people use the term...they are usually using it as profanity. That is also why I told you """"The Fuck article mentions sexual intercourse in its lead because it is especially relevant to the topic. However, the term 'fuck' is not especially relevant to the topic of sexual intercourse."""" 

I cannot see how this article is broken simply because it doesn't currently include """"fuck."""" But, like I stated, I don't mind adding it to the article. I'd rather see what others have to state on that matter first, however.   """,0.2857142857142857

 Nice job on autism causes page 

  Common sense award I think what is on the causes of autism page is well done.  I also like your common sense approach.  I am not really sure how to send you a message on content but thought I would try this.  I see the vitamin D deficiency hypothesis which should be there because it is in the literature, but the hypothesis does not make any sense because oral supplementation of vitmain D among the very young has increased dramatically over the last 20 years and autism increases with it.  An alternative cause of the epidemic is the opposite: too much vitamin D supplementation and fortification among the very young, which makes a lot of sense considering the calcium channel nature of many autism syndromes, the biochemistry of those with autism, and the epidemic.  I have a book about it on amazon and some academics have told me the ideas in it are provacative.  Does something need significant media exposure before it can appear in wikipedia?  As you seem to know a lot about autism causes would you have any interest in reviewing it?  I could send you a .pdf copy.   
 Hi, .  I appreciate your kind words, but causes of autism in fact, most of our autism articles was mostly written by now-departed ; it would need to be a high-quality journal because autism is a featured article, and it would need to be an independent secondary review per our medical sourcing guidelines.   In otherwords, there is no need for me to review your book; your work and theory would need to be covered by an independent high-quality journal review of the causes of autism.   (Talk) """,0.0

Jevons indeed said that his work was not an extension of classical economics; it was Marshall who drew upon classical economics to explain the supply curve.  That's why I keep associating neoclassical economics with the latter rather than with the former. (One could labor the effect of Marshall upon Jevons, but that would be beside the point here.)
Whatever the intentions about POV when the original version of this article was written, it has got basic facts wrong.

Is this person cuchullian a member of the Klu Klux Klan or the reincarnation of some murderous crusader era Jesuit? Hard to believe such fanatic people exist even in 21st century.All his edits point to white supremacist thinking. The opinion of one guy who makes a living out of serving the Vatican- """"Vadakekkara"""" is quoted all around the article as something authentic. Nobody has heard of his name as a historian.
Note that cuchullian is quoting records of """"Vatican"""" and """"goa""""- both terms which are associated with murder, genocide and inquisitions among the Saint Thomas Christians.

Using Vatican sources and goan archives made during the Inquisitions by fanatic western Jesuit priests to to depict the history of Saint Thomas Christians is really deplorable. This person seems hell bent on using wikipedia as a means to insult people and to turn this encyclopaedia as some sort of an inquisition device.

A parallel to the massacre of history made here would be akin to using Nazi archives to write an article on the history of Israel and the Exodus. Fanatics like cuchullian belong in the medieval era. His pro-vatican edits can be seen if you refer the edits hes made. A guy with a hate agenda.

There's been an amusing tit-for-tat re-edit of the location of Whitgift School as a result of user Samtheboy mistakenly believing that the school is in the county of Surrey. Without wishing to sound like an anorak, this Greater London vs. the 'old' county boundaries around London is a bit of an old chestnut. Significant changes in local government in the 1960s and 70s (the result of the inexorable spread of suburban London) meant that towns like Croydon, Kingston and Bromley in the south were swallowed up by London, becoming the London Borough of Croydon, etc. One old county - Middlesex - disappeared altogether. Confusingly, the Post Office retained the old names, disregarding the new borough locations, and to this day people in places like Thornton Heath believe they live in Surrey - a fact which couldn't be further from the truth. The same is true of south Croydon, which is in the London Borough of Croydon and hence Greater London. The county of Surrey begins further down the road and the local council taxpayers, commercial ratepayers and other residents of south Croydon pay their taxes, have their roads repaired and their refuse collected by the local London borough. I suppose the reaction is: who cares? But if Wikipedia has pretentions to accuracy, we should get these things right.

My cite states that no notes issued prior to the """"greenbacks"""" were legal tender under the greenbacks and you would have known this if you had bothered to read he material I posted in the two wiki Fed articles. BTW: are you wise and omniscient ones (sarcasm) aware that Federal reserve notes were not legal tender until 1933?

lets see if you read it here 

I believe that Congress does NOT have the power to make paper money a legal tender and does not even have the power to make gold and silver a legal tender.The reference below show clearly that at least one US president and Funding Father agree with me on both counts and that at least two US presidents, and Founding Fathers agree with me on one count.

I hope that claims of original research and synthesis can now be put to rest as BOGUS.

An old NY times article http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res;=9501E2DB133BEE33A25751C1A9669D94679ED7CF references the following quotes

James Madison  - Thus the pretext for a paper currency and particularly for making the bill a legal tender, either for public or private debt, was cut off

Thomas Jefferson - I now deny their (Congress's) power of making paper money, or anything else, a legal tender

A Mr Benton who is also cited, states: The power granted to Congress to coin money is an authority to stamp metallic money, and is not an authority for emitting slips of paper containing promises to pay money.

Per Yale Law School records of the minutes of the vote to TAKE AWAY from Congress the power to """"emit bills of credit"""" during the Constitutional Convention as recorded by Founding Father and future president James Madison  http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/debates_816.asp 

FN23 This vote in the affirmative by Virga. was occasioned by the acquiescence of Mr. Madison who became satisfied that striking out the words would not disable the Govt. from the use of public notes as far as they could be safe & proper; & would only cut off the pretext for a paper currency, [FN24] and particularly for making the bills a tender [FN24] either for public or private debts. 

and

""""Mr. Ghorum was for striking out, without inserting any prohibition. if the words stand they may suggest and lead to the measure.""""

My aside: The power to be struck out was the power to """"emit"""". Mr. Ghorum, (Madison misspelled the name - the person is actually Nathanial Gorham) states that if the words stand (the words being """"emit bills of credit"""") that """"they may suggest and lead to the measure"""" with the measure being printing legal tender paper money. To be ABSOLUTELY clear, this vote denied Congress the power to """"emit"""" per money, and strikes at the core of arguments in favor of paper money, because Congress cannot make paper money a legal tender because the power to print paper money was REMOVED from Congress. If Congress cannot even print paper money, how can it make it legal tender?

In Federalist 44 - Madison states 

The extension of the prohibition to bills of credit must give pleasure to every citizen, in proportion to his love of justice and his knowledge of the true springs of public prosperity. The loss which America has sustained since the peace, from the pestilent effects of paper money on the necessary confidence between man and man, on the necessary confidence in the public councils, on the industry and morals of the people, and on the character of republican government, constitutes an enormous debt against the States chargeable with this unadvised measure, which must long remain unsatisfied; or rather an accumulation of guilt, which can be expiated no otherwise than by a voluntary sacrifice on the altar of justice, of the power which has been the instrument of it.

From Craig v Misouri

 The whole was intended to exclude everything from use as a circulating medium except gold and silver''', and to give to the United States the exclusive control over the coining and valuing of the metallic medium. That the real dollar may represent property, and not the shadow of it.

From the dissenting opinion to one of the Legal Tender cases http://supreme.justia.com/us/79/457/case.html - starts with THE CHIEF JUSTICE, dissenting'Acts of Congress not made in pursuance of the Constitution are not laws.We perceive no connection between the express power to coin money and the inference that the government may, in any contingency, make its securities perform the functions of coined money, as a legal tender in payment of debtsIt is unnecessary to say that we reject wholly the doctrine, advanced for the first time",0.0

"Battle of Levounion 1091 not copyright violation and (Manzikert- Anatolia was not ethnic cleansing) 

Pechenegs had been driven out of their homeland by the Cumans and settled in Northern Bulgaria since some years, they raided and invaded Byzantine Thrace with their families and intended to settle at the Maritza river,[1]

But at the Battle of Levounion 1091 the Pechenegs were attacked by a combined army of Byzantines with Cuman mercenaries, the Pechenegs were almost totally killed, soldiers and civilians, this battled nearly annihilated the Pecheneg people. Later the survivors were massacred in the Battle of Beroia. (This is clearly ethnic cleansing, even if they were a newly migrated people to the Balkans.) 

I added:
At the Battle of Levounion (1091), the Pecheneg, a nomadic Turkic people from the Pontic-Caspian steppe, were nearly wiped out by the sedentary Byzantine Greeks and nomadic Cumans.{{cite book|last=Agbedo|first=Chris|title=Problems of multilingual nations  the Nigerian perspective|year=2007|publisher=Fidgina Global Books|location=Enugu, Nigeria|isbn=9789788132844|page=89|url=http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&hl;=nl&q;=ethnic+cleansing+greeks+pechenegs&btnG;=#hl=nl&tbm;=bks&sclient;=psy-ab&q;=The+Pechenegs%2C+nomadic+Turkic+peop-o+from+the+steppe%2C+were+nearly+annihilated+at+the+Battle+of+Levounion+by+a+combined+Byzantine+and+Cuman+army+in+1091.&oq;=The+Pechenegs%2C+nomadic+Turkic+peop-o+from+the+steppe%2C+were+nearly+annihilated+at+the+Battle+of+Levounion+by+a+combined+Byzantine+and+Cuman+army+in+1091.&gs;_l=serp.12...21850.21850.3.22808.1.1.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0...0.1...1c..15.psy-ab.NHxON2jEZfU&pbx;=1&bav;=on.2,or.r_qf.&bvm;=bv.47244034,d.d2k&fp;=1f7c60039cb2be7d&biw;=1438&bih;=647

Original sentence was: The Pechenegs, nomadic Turkic people from the steppe, were nearly annihilated at the Battle of Levounion by a combined Byzantine and Cuman army in 1091.

I changed this into  At the Battle of Levounion (1091), the Pecheneg, a nomadic Turkic people from the Pontic-Caspian steppe, were nearly wiped out by the sedentary Byzantine Greeks and nomadic Cumans.

Manzikert Anatolia
This was added from the same book: After the Battle of Manzikert (1071), Greek populations of Anatolia were ethnically cleansed by nomadic Seljuk Turks

But the original sentence in the book was:[1]
The ethnic cleansing of sedentary Greek population of Anatolia by nomadic Seljuk Turks after the Battle of Manzikert in 1071.

If Levounion is copyright violation than this is also.

The idea that Seljuk Turks ethnically cleansed Anatolia is not true, Anatolian Greek populations survived till 1922, the Population exchange between Greece and Turkey.

Claiming Seljuks ethnically cleansed Anatolia is historically incorrect, it had a multicultural population, besides Seljuks had a sedentary state Seljuk Empire,  besides this claim was based upon one source, which was added by cherry picking and snippet abuse.

 The precise definition of race is under dispute.. 

I wrote this to help spread understanding, please make sure to read the definitions of outcrossing on the link.

There is a lot of misunderstanding of genetics and further there is a lot of misinformation that people spread because they WANT you to think that there is no difference between peoples for a political or social agenda, that does not make it so. Humans share 98% of our genetic code with Chimpanzees, yet that 2% defines our differences and is important as is the difference in the human population, no matter how small the difference.

There are obviously differences in the expressed traits between Asian, African and Caucasian. These are different types of humans, if you choose to call the a race/breed or type it's up to you and it's immaterial. My argument has always been that racial diversity should be preserved which is a more neutral position rather than promoting that race mixing and interbreeding is somehow positive.

You and many people that listen to pop culture may think that by interbreeding you are helping humanity and there are lots of myths about how you will create better offspring; offspring that have the best of both parents. This is just a myth told by people who, are trying to say that people are equal, if different. Yes, people are people as Americans we believe that all people have certain inalienable rights but the best position for humanity is for each of the races to exist, separately to be the best we can. If you truly understand the advantages that diversity offers you will agree too.

I personally breed horses. And this is where I'll start telling you a story: the Thoroughbred horse started out as a mixed race horse. It was based on Arab stock and was bred only for speed for many generations, regardless of breed, the horse that ran the race the fastest was bred to other fast horses. The Thoroughbred breeding book is now closed, which means you cannot breed a Thoroughbred to any other breed, because, ANY cross you make outside of the gene pool will reduce the speed of the horse. This is called line breeding, please read this article as a basic """"learn to breed"""" guideline: http://www.learntobreed.com/linebreeding.html. Line breeding(inbreeding) is a useful technique as is outcrossing when advantagous to produce quality results, random mixing is like a child finger-painting and does nothing positive.

What Wikipedia has been proposing is that random interbreeding is potentially a good idea and should be treated as potentially positive. Any person who knows about breeding animals will disagree, it's very unlikely that race mixing will result in a positive result unless it was planned for by a geneticist. When you cited the plant hybridization, that's what you were doing citing a hybrid that was designed in a laboratory and there were not human beings or living animals as a result of a genetic mistake. You can't through bad human crosses in the trash like you can with corn.""",0.0

 This is an interesting discussion with good points made by all. I can add a little bit that might be helpful. As mentioned by the editors above the dictionay definition and a legal definition are not the same and one state's legal definition might be different from another's. So why not say this in the article. What definition a reader needs or wants depends on their purpose. For example, if a young person is reading a book meant for older persons and comes across the word adultery, his needs will be far different than those of a lawyer who's client walks in and says, """"They charged me with 'adultery'; what's that?"""" In the first case the reader might need nothing more than a dictionary definition (or perhaps a little more, particularly that it is rare for someone to go to jail for it), and in the second case, the lawyer will want to explain all the elements of the crime (each thing that must be proved by the government in order to find someone guilty, including that it was done knowingly, etc.).

 The beginning could say: """"Adultery, in some jurisdictions a crime or a tort (a civil wrong) is generally defined as (insert dictionary definition). However in the legal context of a person actually being charged with adultery as a crime or cited as a grounds for a divorce or other lawsuit, a more precise definition would be required.

 The term adultery usually refers to the rarely prosecuted common law or statutory crime relating to having extra-marital relations, but usually in an informal or literary context not in a legal context.

 In ordinary usage the vagueness of the term is not a hindrance to communication, as the scope of the term is understood to change from context to context, some requiring more specifics than others. In a legal sense, residents of the United States, for example, understand that such laws differ from state to state, and even from time to time as laws are changed, and thus any legal use of the term is understood to require new research practically any time it comes up.""""

 Restructuring

I grouped all the participated competitions together so that it looks organized.
Removed the statistics; the Taiwanese team is not even in any of those tables.

Again, I began by saying that I don't think the word is perfect and that it needed to be worked out here rather than simply excised with an NPOV comment on the edit. And, actually, I do have a similar remark from Raul Hilberg's mouth later in the article, but I don't believe that this entirely addresses POV/NPOV. My point is not to say that the Anschluss cannot be viewed as the military annexation of Austria but that to view it as """"simply"""" that would be to """"misunderstand"""" its essence, which would not in any case provide anything like absolution but does have the effect of changing the subject (hence my wording """"tends to conceal"""").

 Re Islamic architecture 
Hi Mcginnly. Sure, no problem at all. Just be bold and do it. By the way, you are doing a very good job at the article. Here are some refs re to Quba Mosque as the first mosque in Islam:

Portal:Architecture
Hello, are you interested in rotating the Portal every third week? 

Very nice pictures of Barcelona. May I nominate some for featured picture at Commons? Thanks  

You're right that it always needs updating in many ways. Don't forget also DYK and in the news (in the news we sadly seem to neglect the most). It would be nice to even rotate the SI and SAs on a shorter than 1 week basis sometime, I don't know if were ready for that yet even though we have something of a backlog developing in the nominations. What do you think of this, Hallidie Building? I found a picture for it finally, and need to substantiate the claim about the first curtain wall. I forget where I read that, but know I did somewhere. Once I remember and add a little more, it might be my first DYK. Best, + R/W 

 Proposal accepted - re: """"…so my proposal is:- perhaps you guys would consider lending a hand keeping those bits up to date and I'll rotate on the 3rd week. How does that sound?…"""" See also new toolbar, below. Feel free to edit if its useful. — (talk • contribs) 

Thanks! You can rotate the portal tonight, if you'd like to, or I'll get to it tomorrow, since I delayed two weeks now. — 

mosque to house
I think that will be more accurate. it's a pilgrimage site therefore a shrine... the use of mosque in the ref is used not in accurate fashion.  

Pilgrimage site and worship site. It is more accurately a worshiping site and muslims come from all over the world to visit it as it is one of the 3 holiest sites. Maybe having it Mosque for worship is enough and fair along with the word shrine.  

house of pilgrimage. if not, it's best to leave it. almaqdisi, stop stalking.  

I do not undersand. Mginnly is saying that there are many sources which mention it is a Mosque. This is true. Now you are discussing it is for piligrimage or worship. Pointless. Keep the word a Mosque only if pilgrimage will be an issue of debate too! No need to mention piligrimage or worship, just a mosque. And accroding  to the definition of a Mosque, it is a place of worship. In Mecca the piligrims go to worship in a Mosque called masjid al-Haram. But again, if this is an issue of debate, forget it and just keep the word Mosque along with the word shrine. Simple...  
it's by definition not a mosque. some refer to it as mosque because of pilgrimage. No, the article will never say in the lead that it's a """"mosque"""" because it isn't. Live with it.  

Alternate version will be to leave """"shrine"""" and in the end of the lead say something like """"Some refer to the Dome as a Rock as a mosque even though it isn't"""". That can be acceptable too.  

Amuros, please let us not repeat the stuff we did in several talk pages...! Any one can go to Google and find """"Dome of the Rock Mosque"""" or """"Mosque of Umar"""" to see that this is indeed a Mosque.! I will stop discussing this any further.

The band plays a blend of multiple genres of metal: metalcore, thrash metal, gothic metal, industrial metal and death metal, but they don't always put all the styles into a single song. They rather blend two or three of these styles into one song, making it difficult for their songs to be catalogued as a specific genre.

Again, I never asserted the Greaseman's death.

Since Neturalhomer chooses to edit his User Talk page to erase the past, I will post the relevant exchange here (he gave """"removing vandalism"""" as the reason for editing it out; his only tool is a hammer, perhaps, so he sees me as a nail, perhaps)

Your Lie(s) About Me

You wrote: """"Final Warning

Saying things like """"DC101 IS HIS FUCKING EMPLOYER!!!"""" and """"Don't be a douche"""" is a good way to get blocked....fast. Tone the language down...and pay attention. Greaseman ain't dead. If you continue, to add continued, now, lies to Wikipedia, I will report you to AIV and to your ISP, Verizon. Stop now, this is your final warning. - NeutralHomer • Talk """"

Yes, I did use the language (on a talk page) and if it will make the booboo feel better, I apologize. But who doesn't enjoy a nice summer's eve?

BUT, you need to STOP LYING about me. I never said the Greaseman was dead, only that his death had been reported by sources considered reliable by Wikipedia standards. A little attention to detail on your part would be much appreciated, Eve. Otherwise, perhaps it is I who shall report you. Tell you what: you admit and retract your lie and I will consider the matter closed. Fair?

Let's look at your odd writing style: """"If you continue, to add continued, now, lies to Wikipedia,"""" Just what are you going for there?

I've never put a lie on Wikipedia, contrary to your assertion. Anyone who lies about me can go screw.

Your threat to report me to my ISP (FOR WHAT, EVE?) is beyond pathetic. Two pops for yes!! Report away.

Now, the admin who blocked me said that more than one reliable source was needed on sensitive matters.  He did not research sufficiently to reach a correct conclusion.

Let's all remember, shall we, that I never said that Greaseman was dead, simply that he was REPORTED DEAD.  There's a big difference, and the fact that it was reported is not in dispute.  I NEVER SAID GREASEMAN WAS DEAD.  Yet Neutralhomer continues to assert that I did.  THAT IS A LIE.  I consider someone lying about me a personal attack, under Wikipedia guidelines.  Is this a """"separate but equal"""" or """"separate and unequal"""" system?

The admin who blocked me wants more than one source that someone said something on the radio.  Let's look at Wikipedia's entry on Cesar Romero's personal life, shall we?  There is NO source cited for his death, nor his homosexuality, yet those are all sensitive topics, are they not?  Why doesn't Neutralhomer report the author of this page for vandalism?

The fact that Neutralhomer claims that dealing with me gave him a migraine on the talk page of the admin who blocked me demonstrates that this is a personally based effort on his part.

To recap: I never lied.  I never vandalized.  That should be enough.

Now let's look at Wikipedia's reckless report of Cesar Romero's death and homosexuality, shall we?  Sensitive matters, no?

Personal life

Romero believed in liberation theology. Romero was very Christian yet still believed in a utopian society whose belief is that Christ's kingdom would be very similar to Marx's envisionment of communism, and held to this belief until his death.[1][2]

Romero always claimed his grandfather on his mother's side was Cuban poet and patriot José Martí, although his mother's parents were legally Carmen and Manuel Mantilla with José Martí as his godfather. There was some speculation that Maria was fathered by Martí who was a boarder in the Mantilla household, but he never claimed Maria as his daughter in his lifetime.

Romero was never married, despite proposing to at least one woman. Romero made regular appearances on the Hollywood social circuit, usually in the company of an attractive actress, and he was almost always described in interviews and articles as a """"confirmed bachelor."""" Romero discussed his homosexuality in a series of interviews with author Boze Hadleigh, with the understanding that they would not be published during his lifetime.

Romero wore a man's tennis bracelet inscribed with his favorite nickname: """"Butch."""" The term was reportedly bestowed on Romero by his one-time dancing partner Joan Crawford, who teased Romero by telling him: """"You're so butch!"""" While Romero's homosexuality was an """"open secret"""" in Hollywood, the movie-going public was unaware of his sexual proclivities and there was never any embarrassing scandal surrounding his male liaisons, which shows the care and finesse with which he conducted his private life for more than 60 years.

Romero was a mainstay of the Hollywood social circuit until his death in 1994. He was interred at Inglewood",0.14285714285714285

Hi, MurderWatcher1. This is Paul1513 again. This is to let you know that I have completed the SLR Chronology bibliography for you and that I am going to try to upload  a PDF copy to your Talk page as soon as I finish this note. This may take a while, because I've never uploaded a PDF before.

You're absolutely right; it would be great if some of the old Modern Photography stuff could be added to Wikipedia. However, you can be sure that they're still under copyright. (Pre-1978 American """"work-for-hire"""" copyrights are generally 75 years; 1978 and on, 95 years.) The real question is: Who OWNS the copyright today? Since Modern went under, there have been many media company sales and resales - the present copyright holder would be hell to uncover and ask permission. In fact, the current owner might not even know that it owns Modern's copyrights. """"Orphaned"""" copyrights are a major unresolved """"fair use"""" issue in the information age.

Speaking of first cameras: mine was a simple Vivitar 110 point-and-shoot. My parents gave it to me for getting straight A's  in the 5th grade. It was, of course, a bad camera, but it opened up a world of possibilities. From the Vivitar, I eventually learned about the existence of the Pentax Auto 110 SLR. It was then one step to 35 mm SLRs and I got a Nikon FE2 in 1983. The FE2 is also the reason why the bulk of my Modern Photography magazine citations begin around 1983.

I'm sorry to hear about your disputes with the Admins over your non-photography Wkipedia entries. It would be unfortunate if you felt compelled to end your Wikipedia activities over them. Perhaps you could start a blog or create a MySpace or Facebook page to air these issues without worrying about what the Admins want.

Ugly Personal Attacks - You Approve??

""""Good Morning, Philippe. The post above yours, by LoverofArt, is typical of his posts in my direction. An ugly personal attack, by a person who has in essence defamed a widely respected organization  the National Civilian Community Corps  by posting false and misleading information at the Wikipedia website.
If your / Wikipedia's best idea is that what should happen next is that I enter into a prolonged dialogue with that person, hoping to reason with him/her, while he/she continues to exert control over content and issue ugly diatribes, then your processes leave a great deal to be desired. A responsible adult  a real Editor  should have interceded long ago.

He/she and the others working over the NCCC text at this time seem to feel that any statement introduced by the phrase """"According to ___,"""" does not belong at Wikipedia. As I read it, there was objection at one of your pages to placing references at the end of that phrase rather than at the end of the quotation. Why an encyclopedia would have as a policy including bald claims (as if fact) without reference to the source in its text eludes me. It would give the impression that the encyclopedia had evaluated the statement, which is obviously not the case.

I appreciate Wikipedia's effort to provide freely accessible information to the public. I am not impressed, however, by the response to gross errors made at the Wikipedia site. Your crew is attacking the messenger at least in part because it is the message that it does not like.
A pretty sorry performance, which you seem to be joining by failing to address the issues I raise or the attacks on me.
Pull LoverofArt out of this situation and I will join in a dispute resolution process regarding editing the NCCC site. I refuse to have further dealings with him/her.Coterminous """"""",0.0

New Louisville definition
Since the Census Bureau has clearly defined the new Louisville as only the old city and unincorporated areas, I think there some details needed that need to be added defining Metro Government. First, it is important  to note that a KY Legislative bill (dubbed the Lyndon Bill} prohibits suburban cities from annexing more land. If this were not the case then the unincorp. areas could create their own government and only the old city would again be left.  Second, this definition won't effect the new city's population growth, since nearly all growth is in the unicorpirated areas and nearly all suburban cities are having very slow growth or even populatiuon losses. Third, even if Suburban cities don't count toward the population, their residents can still vote for Metro mayor and council members, and will still receive Metrowide help in such areas as urban planning and emergency services.
Personally, I think the official municipality (the entire county) is what should make up this article, regardless of what the Census Bureau says. The smaller article with the """"balance"""" is what should have the information for the census-defined city.  
Your ideas of what the census bureau has defined are not correct. What you are referring to is the Louisville-Jefferson County balance, which is not the same thing as consolidated Louisville-Jefferson County. Both are defined separately by the Census Bureau (see here). This article is about the consolidated Louisville-Jefferson County (which is how the city is legally incorporated). The confusion lies in the Census Bureau's use of balance figures when ranking cities, rather than the consolidated figures. (Although even this use is inconsistant as they seem to use the full consolidated figures for the decennial rankings.)  
The Census Bureau has accepted the Louisville/ Jefferson balance, but not the City/County Consolidation, which is why the suburban populations are not counted in its estimates and won't be in future censuses. Because of the acceptence of the Lou/Jef Balance, my points should be brought up about the ban on suburban city annexation. If this were not the case then the Balance could be quickly eaten up by the suburbs.
Your assertion is not entirely correct. The Census Bureau does, in fact, include the entire consolidated Louisville-Jefferson County in their estimates. They also include a separate figure for the balance:
 170,Louisville/Jefferson County,Kentucky,A,693604,693872,694757,695843,698059,698903,699827
 162,Louisville/Jefferson County (balance),Kentucky,A,551183,551390,552058,552828,554381,555366,556429
That's from the 2005 estimates (the last number is the 2005 estimated population). This article is not about the balance, however. Issues involving the balance should be discussed on the balance article's talk page.  

 Actual Population 
There are too many disputes about the population of the actual city proper. According to the Census bureau estimates, the balance population is 556,429 and not anywhere near 700,000. What is the actual city proper population, as that is to be what is listed? I do not believe that Louisville has a population anywhere near that of Columbus, Ohio. We need to decide the official population of the city proper and correct any and all inaccurate statements regarding the actual population. There are several pages in Wikipedia listing the population as 699,000 (or so), when the Census lists the population as 556,429. I understand that several people (especially those who live in the area) want the population figure to be high so the city can reach a higher status. If it was a city I lived in, I would like to do the same. However, that cannot be done here. An actual, correct population for the city proper and the metro needs to be listed. If we are able to, we need to come up with the balance population of the counties and the actual city. I am a little confused myself, and I did not want to attempt to change anything before it is discussed.  

There have been many people who have debated this over and over again and we have come to the consensus that is now demonstrated in the article.  Please, for the sake of your own knowledge, read all the talk archives that cover this situation.  Since there is a consensus that's currently overwhelmingly not in your favor, you might want to do that research before thinking about flaming things up. — [[User:Stevietheman|",0.0

"Questions over status

As already mentioned above the legal status of this constabulary IS a grey area.  I am a serving officer in the Met and many of my colleagues are unaware of the powers and remit of borough constabularies such as the WPP.  If serving front line police officers are unsure, then I have to say there is a definite grey area for the public.  I have done some research and discovered some interesting points which the article does not in its present form represent.  As a result, I and it would appear an anon editor have edited the article to try and make a better and objective article which reflects reality.  As it was, the article was subjective and questionable.  However these edits have been reverted without explanation – apart from comments such as ‘this is the truth’.  In effort to explain my edits and prevent an edit war I set out below my reason for altering the article. 

London Borough Parks Constabularies are, as is correctly quoted, established under sec 18 of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government Provision Order Confirmation 1967.  This act allows London borough councils to establish a body of constables who have the power to enforce parks bye-laws in their respective parks.  It does not make these constables ‘police constables’ and does not allow police services or forces to be established.  No police powers are given to these parks constables (with the exception of parks bye laws) over and above those which everybody is entitled, often referred to as ‘any person’ powers or as in the case of arrest, ‘citizen’s arrest’.  

In comparison, officers from Home Office forces (such as the Met, Kent Police etc) can point to the Police Act 1996 as the basis for their establishment, jurisdiction and powers as police constables.  BTP officers can point to the Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003.  Ministry of Defence Police officer can point to the Ministry of Defence Police Act 1986.  I could go on…My point is that all these police forces have a legal basis and with the attached powers to call themselves police officers and the organisations they work for police services/forces.  The WPP does not, unless someone can point to a piece of legislation that I have missed.

So the article started by saying, “Wandsworth Parks Police is a Police Service successfully run…”.  Two points about the opening sentence.  Firstly, its NOT legally a police service but a borough parks constabulary.  Secondly, the comment regarding ‘successfully run’ is highly subjective and without basis.  All organisations would like to be thought of a successful, but without any citation it should not be in an encyclopaedic article.

Under legal status the paragraph starts by mentioning the Met and working closely with it.  Irrelevant to legal status me thinks and again subjective.  Why mention a home office force in the legal status paragraph of a parks constabulary.  This paragraph should merely be about the legal status of WPP and its constables.  The paragraph rightly states that a magistrate swears WPP constables in, but not as ‘police constables’ but as ‘parks constables’ due to the legislation involved.  Once sworn in the parks constables have executive powers to enforce parks bye-laws in their boroughs ONLY.  Criminal law is not included.  However, just like the general public, parks constables can enforce criminal law in certain limited circumstances relating to indictable offences only.  This is commonly known as ‘citizens arrest’.  Due to changes in arrest powers with SOCAP in 2006, non police officers, such as parks constables need to be aware of the necessity criteria to make an arrest lawful.  My point is that the article read like the parks constables had police powers – they don’t (apart from the bye law aspect).  The paragraph then goes on to state that parks constables come under PACE.  Well this is obvious and irrelevant, any arrest by anyone is under PACE (as amended by SOCAP).  What it doesn’t do is give parks constables any more power than Joe Public (apart from the bye law aspect).  For all the above reasons, the last sentence of this paragraph (“They are always Parks Police Officers regardless of the technicalities of whether or not they are in the act of enforcing bye-laws.”) is not a true reflection of law and quite frankly wrong and misleading.  There is no such thing as a parks ‘police officer’. 

I had added at the bottom of the article two paragraphs with cited evidence which brings into question the status of parks constabularies and their use of the word ‘police’, blue lights and use of batons etc.  These were deleted without reason.  They are legitimate sources which shed light on the grey area.  You may not agree with the report and committee’s results but they are in the public domain and support my contention that there IS a grey area and WPP are treading on thin ice on occasion.

The dick who is editing with policy is also editing out of policy, by being arrogant, lazy and fucking up the functionality of the Image Workshop. His worrying obsession with NFCC#9 is his excuse for being a twat. he is deliberately making the workshop non-functional.

Now Mr Dick esq comes along, deletes both the image and the link making the request impossible to deal with unless we go looking for an invisible comment hidden in the source code of the request. In spite of being told of 2 methods of maintaining NFCC#9 compliance and maintaining IW functionality Hammersoft refuses to use them. One of the methods only involves putting a colon at the front of the link. But will Hammersoft do this? No, he has refused point blank.

"Koala claims that there are no legitimate descendants of the Hohenstaufen, which is a different thing than saying that legitimate male line is extinct. And in this very case, it is incorrect to allege that legitimate descents via women are nonexistent, while legitimate male line descent truly is extinct. They are not the same thing, as those of us who know genealogy, are well aware. I observe that the Yopie has chosen to join the same falsehood. I think Yopie and Koala need to cease their falsehoods and stop those edits of theirs. I understand Yopie is not fluent enough in English (being obviously a foreigner, from Czechia). Those 'warnings' Yopie distributes here and there, are manifestly unwarranted, and rather a signal of twisted tactics in Wikipedia conduct than anything constructive. For example, Yopie sometimes alleges vandalism in clear cases of non-vandalism. Yopie's such behavior should and may lead to him getting sanctioned.   

as to Yopie's quibbling using unrelated claims, I suppose he means to say that all female-line descents from all dukes of Anjou are illegitimate. But of course those who know genealogy and titles, are aware that strictly speaking, neither of those peinces actually are 'princes' of Anjou, they would themselves be first to admit that their claim is to the title of duke of that.

This cannot be counted as a TAROM's international destinaton, because it is not a DIRECT Bucharest - Montreal flight and it is not operated by a TAROM aircraft on all its length. On the other hand, OTP - LHR (Bucharest - London) can be counted as an international destination for TAROM. It is a direct flight, operated by a TAROM aircraft.

The problem is not what you're trying to say but how you're going about saying it.  Quoting the subject of an article in the form """"She remembers saying..."""" is simply not encyclopaedic at all.

I AM NOT """"generally discussing a topic"""", I AM NOT """"chatting"""". I AM NOT
""""pushing a P.O.V."""".  If you do not understand basic English grammar, you have
no business telling me anything.  FACT: commas are used in this context to
separate a list, a series, of related clauses.  Grammar is not a matter of a
""""general discussion"""" or """"chatting"""" or a """"point of view"""".  It is a technically
precise set of rules, and in this case, a set of rules that demonstrate that
the foundation of the issue is a fraud.  THIS IS NOT OPINION, IT IS FACT, IT
IS RELEVANT TO THE ARTICLE, IT IS FOUNDATIONAL TO THE ARTICLE.  I AM TALKING
ABOUT IMPROVING THE ARTICLE BY CLARIFYING THE FOUNDATION ACCORDING TO THE
RULES OF ENGLISH GRAMMAR AS ANY LITERATE PERSON CAN SEE.  AND I AM TALKING
ABOUT ADDING THE RELEVANT AND FOUNDATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL CLAUSE.

FROM TALK GUIDELINES (why don't you review them!):

 There is reasonable allowance for speculation, suggestion, and personal
knowledge on talk pages, with a view to prompting further investigation.

 make the extra effort so that other people understand you. Being
friendly is a great help.

 It is always a good idea to explain your views; it is less helpful for you to
voice an opinion on something and not explain why you hold it.

 Article talk pages should be used to discuss ways to improve an article;

 Deal with facts

 The talk page can be used to """"park"""" material removed from the article due to
verification or other concerns, while references are sought or concerns
discussed.

 The talk page is particularly useful to talk about edits.

 New proposals for the article can be put forward for discussion
by other editors if you wish.

 Do not threaten people: For example, ...
having them banned for disagreeing with you.

 removing others' comments is sometimes allowed.
But you should ... stop if there is any objection.

As I previously posted here: THE ARTICLE SHOULD BE IMPROVED by making it clear
in the opening statement that the entire issue is a fraud upon the public
since there is no """"natural born citizen"""" requirement that is applicable today.
That is fundamental to an informative relevant foundation to the article, not
a matter of opinion, and a matter of grammatical fact.

If I say """"No animal except a mouse, or a rat, at the time I give the signal,
shall be captured"""", then I am saying only mice and rats shall be captured AT
THE TIME I GIVE THE SIGNAL.  My order has no validity at any other point in
time.  Similarly, the requirement for """"natural born citizen"""" only applied AT
THE TIME OF THE ADOPTION OF THIS CONSTITUTION.  It does not apply today, and
the following clause should be part of the article, since it is the clause at
the foundation of the issue in the article:

No person except a natural born Citizen, or a
Citizen of the United States, at the time of the
Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible
to the Office of President; neither shall any
person be eligible to that Office who shall not
have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and
been fourteen Years a Resident within the United
States.

"""=Sexism in MGS5, relevant to an encyclopedic entry on the game?===
Came back to this article to see if any progress had been made on cleaning it up. Good to see some progress has been made.
I'm going to make a few points here and well.. hopefully people will be rationale and objective about it.

Misinformation. This article is rife with it. It's incredibly important for an encyclopedia to present accurate information. An encyclopedia should not be an opinion column, it should not overly represent any opinion since they are not based on fact, nor relevant to a topic. I'm going to start with the 'Sexualized Portrayal of Quiet' and sadly I'm going to have to tear it apart. Please put how you feel about it or any emotion you may have about the topic aside when you read the following points;

1 - No other character in any other Metal Gear title pages is given this amount of scrutiny. Quiet has been highlighted by the media as sexist, this is true. However this is not a reason for an encyclopedic entry to focus on a given character. The page is not a study of the media's (or anyone else's) reaction to Quiet as a character. There should be balance in the reception section, giving a whole section to Quiet versus no other characters is not balanced.

2 - Misinformation. """"Michael McWhertor criticized Quiet's portrayal, pointing out that while the game explains that her nakedness derives from a photosynthetic skin condition, several other characters with the same condition — such as Code Talker in The Phantom Pain and The End in Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater — appear fully clothed.""""

Regardless of the source of information, if it is incorrect information it should not be in the entry. Quiet is naked because her lungs were burnt to a crisp, the game specifically mentions this and other fans have mentioned it on the page I believe. Code Talker and The End have the same ability correct, but they did not get set on fire and thrown out of a building. I'm really baffled this is in here because McWhertor is not an authority on this whatsoever. Kojima and the game writers are. Source it correctly or remove the information I would have said.

3 - Opinion columns. This baffles me. Why are opinion pieces been taken as reception? They are not professional video game reviewers. By the media's own admission they are just someone writing their opinion about something, it's not objective. They wouldn't even claim to be unbiased as it's an opinion. You are introducing bias here by taking an opinion and presenting it for no reason other than to say """"this person didn't like Quiet's portrayal"""". If tomorrow Donald Trump wrote an opinion piece on Quiet for a media outlet, is that relevant to an encyclopedic entry about something?

4 - Further irrelevant information. There are sources and information here that talk about the PlayArtsKai figurine of Quiet. Are you out of your mind?! What relevance does this have to the RECEPTION OF THE GAME??? The video game this entry is about. To start with PlayArtsKai is a completely separate company that we have no idea or information about how much Hideo Kojima was involved with. One would assume since they are completely different companies ENTIRELY that Konami simply licensed the intellectual property rights of Quiet to PlayArtsKai. It goes without saying but Twitter is not a valid source of information.

5 - Dates. Numerous sources are reactions to the character Quiet and precede the date of release. Thus they are not a reception of the game itself. Hence why are they in a section called """"Reception"""" to start with.

5 - Forbes contributors and Anita Sarkeesian. We seem to have established that Forbes contributors are not valid sources so I expect this will be okay to remove.

Everything else seems to be sourced from valid sources who are professional video game reviewers. Although again I'd suggest that Quiet is getting an amazing amount of spotlight in the article for no other reason than controversy 

To any senior editors, administrators, or anyone with an interest in Wikipedia standards. It should be extremely concerning that this level of bias is present in an article that is supposed to be by and large, factual. 86.40.28.221

"This article confuses several different types of anti-personnel ammunition - originally called 'shrapnel' (after its inventor), 'grape' and 'cannister'.  Shrapnel and cannister seem to have been mainly land service ammunition while 'grape' seems to have been mainly naval.

Shrapnel was invented circa 1800, but later that century it was used with more modern shaped shells.  A shrapnel shell is like a flying shotgun, the bullets are ejected while the shell is in flight by a small charge and they fly forwards in a cone.  The charge is initiated by a time fuze (igniferious at this period)in the shell's nose, which is blown clear as the bullets leave.  Bullet sizes varied, but by WW1 they were usually lead antimony alloy with a few hundred bullets per pound weight.

Cannister, in contrast, is bullets in a can and the can bursts as it is fired.  This means cannister is short range.  While shrapnel was little used in WW2, cannister was developed for various weapons including tanks.  Australian Centurion tanks in Vietnam had 20-pdr cannister.

Cannister was always carried by British artillery in its 19th century campaigns and quite widely used. Sometimes it had to be locally assembled from old bully-beef cans. Shrapnel remained their primary anti personnel weapon into WW1, and always the ammunition of choice against 'troops in the open'. In 1945 they successfully trialled 95mm shrapnel fuzed VT.

Beehive, correctly called Splintex, was developed by the US in the Vietnam period.  It is a shrapnel type shell - it is fitted with a mechanical time fuze and the flechettes are fired forward from the shell in flight. It was available for 105mm arty, 106mm RCL, 90mm RCL, and probably others.  US policy was for splintex to be only fired at direct fire, ie for arty it was local defence only, presumably for fear of blinds being re-cycled by the enemy into IEDs.  However, the USSR appears to have subsequently developed 122mm and 152mm shells of this type and used them for indirect fire.",0.0

Please do not misrepresent the history of this article, User:DianaW. If what you said were true, I would have to have been the person who originally wrote the section on Gordimer's being robbed and beaten by three black men. As anyone can easily ascertain by studying this article's history, and as you well know, I was only the last of several editors to write, maintain, or modify that section, without removing it. The others who worked on it  who outnumbered you and your confederates  either didn't feel like wasting their time on a flame war with your group, or were unaware of your vandalous campaign. So much for your mythic statement about """"community opinion."""" (The term for the rhetorical dodge in which one claims  popular support for an opinion, is """"bandwagoning."""" There is probably a separate term for the parallel strategy of portraying dissenters as lone cranks, but I don't know it offhand.)

By the way, when I thought about the actual event, as opposed to your group's flame war against anyone seeking to report it, the notion that the incident had no racial significance became ever more ludicrous. First, because you would never have denied the racial significance of a white-on-black attack, and secondly because I have no doubt that the attackers expressly targeted Gordimer because of her race. As anyone who follows life in South Africa knows, such daily race-based attacks, and official indifference towards them, are a part of the institutionalized fabric of that nation's life. People who oppose racism seek to publicize such systemic racial violence. Unfortunately, there are quite a few folks at Wikipedia who seek to suppress all knowledge of black racial violence.

It's hard to imagine what could constitute serious opposition to mainstream anti-racism but would also pass muster under your criteria.  PBS and California Newsreel are not scientific organizations either.  However, like AmRen, they have marshalled scientists and opinion writers to help put forward their views.  Ironically, AmRen has often been evaluated with alarm as more dangerous than other groups by anti-racists because of the quality of its writing and its calm and scholarly tone.

 NPOV of GW article 

I'm adding an {{POV}} tag at the top of the GW article.  This will add the GW article to the Category:NPOV disputes.  This talk section can serve as a springboard to add specific content to the article.    
Sounds like a silly idea to me. -  
Very silly. I just explained why in some detail in the thread above. There are only two views with regard to settled science: Those who understand it and those who don't. Claiming that an article on settled, mainstream science is unbalanced because it doesn't give enough weight to discussing the fallacies of 'those who don't' is just silly.   
 Second the POV Tag Motion - The polarized POV must be neutralized for the reader to understand.  In addition, NPOV changes just like the science does. Above, I've found evidence that the article does not adequately address the scientific views on carbon cycle effects on Global Warming.  As well, the article's comparitive revelance to the """"Anthropogenic Global Warming"""" hypothesis could be better attributed.    

Raise specific issues here first. Discuss them with your fellow volunteer editors first. Make specific suggestions for improvement first. Failure to engage at the talkpage is disruptive and may lead to blocks. - 2/0 (cont.) 

Seems like double standards here. My recent change was reverted within 15 minutes but still no one on this page can tell me why. Many editors believe that this article is biased and represents one POV but that must be discussed here first.   

 I've been discussing my concerns here after being reverted. The POV tag is necessary to reinforce the POV disputes occurring in this talk page, there are at least two sides in the dispute and at least 3 issues underway with multiple editors involved, the POV tag may pave the way for further dispute resolution methods should talk be stymied.  I applaud Mytwocents for taking about the tag before moving to post it, the right way to go for peaceful resolution.    

I support a POV tag on this article - this entire tree of articles is pretty bad from a POV perspective.   

This article as it stands, written from a scientific perspective (which I believe to be appropriate), does not have a POV problem. There are a fair number of editors who want it written from another perspective, that's the problem, and not one likely to lead to a resolution (just look back through the last few years of discussion on this page).   

I support the tag. The article fails to address a lack of concensus on the issue.  
 How about you make a small, good faith effort to impove it?   
I support the tag.   
 On what grounds? All I've seen from you is complaints of talk-page stuff. What edits have you made to improve the article that have been reverted?   

I propose that we close this thread unless somebody comes up with an actual POV problem and shows that it hasn't been honestly addressed here.  NPOV tags are not to be applied for frivolous reasons. TS 

I think that may be premature.  That Mytwocents and others have expressed POV concerns is considered strong evidence th",0.0

After all the times you have thwarted me... After all the times my plans for world domination were foiled by your meddlesome interference... After all the countless times you escaped at the very last moment, finally, I, Butros The Mighty, have defeated you, Crum375, Space Commander From Swalwell! 
How long I have awaited this glorious triumph! The Emperor Of The Universe has secured his dominion on this day! And now that my long struggle is over, how about a little... amusement?
With a clap of my jewel-bedecked hands, I summon the scantily clad dancing girls of my Pan-Galactic Slave-Harem. 
I have destroyed your accursed vessel, Star Of Abuse III, and melted it into slag, from which the galaxy's greatest artisans have forged a grand, towering statue... of me! A statue even larger and grander than the one you toppled, pinning me under its plinth, the day you nearly destroyed my Throne Room! The statue stands here in the Grand Ballroom of my Great Celestial Palace, covered in a gigantic space-tarp, but not so fast, Crum, we are not yet ready for the grand unveiling. 
I have captured the traitorous Princess Angela and her rebel allies from the Spaceship Tax Evader and immobilized them in geo-stationary orbit above my palace. At the merest touch of a button, I can activate the Astro-Detonator and delight the assembled billions here with a fireworks display the likes of which the great Butronian Empire has never seen! Princess Angela may be my own daughter, but that will not stop me from turning her and her fellow Wiki-lovers into space-dust. Even now, helplessly strapped into titanium space-manacles, they witness all I say and do on the Projecto-Screen of the Gallant. Hello, my fair daughter. How does it feel to lay eyes once again on your own... DOOM?
Ha ha ha ha ha!
See how I have seized your puny Earth friends, your boob-lover helper Guy Chapman and boy sidekick Jayjg? They too shall be forced to look on as I gorge in ecstasy at your failure and destroy your planet! Even now, I can see they long for me to discharge the Fang-Creatures of Carnivoron into their glass-walled prison, thus releasing them from the agony of witnessing my victory... But no! First, they will watch you writhe in defeat!
And that is not all, Crum! Surely, even slung in your titanium chains above the Flames Of Hate, you can see that to my right I have, held at Blasto-Ray-point by my Robo-Legionnaires, bound and displayed for all to see... Jimbo Wales and his Rocket Squad! Repturova, the Talurnian walking-lizard spy who betrayed me by joining you! Weissus, commander of the Valkyrie War-Jet Platoon! And last but not least... your beloved Julian Van August!
And now, with the merest wave of my Hypno-Scepter... Watch as your darling Earth friend tumbles under my spell. DANCE! Dance for my amusement! Let the sight of your seductively writhing body, contorting itself for my viewing pleasure, be the last thing Crum sees before she is lowered into the Flames! 
Tears?! Do I see tears in the eyes of the brave Crum375, also kown as Linda Mack? Oh-ho! Even I, in my most sinister, depraved dreams, would never have imagined it!
DANCE FOR MY AMUSEMENT! NEH-HEH heh-heh-heh-heh! HA HAHAHAHA!
How glorious! At last, with trumpet fanfare from my Astro-Orchestra, I order the curtain raised from my statue and...WHAT?!! ... It's a newly rebuilt Star Of Abuse IV! And who is that emerging from the gangplank? Crum, herelf?! 
NO! 
Buddy Jayjg has activated a hidden radio signal! The Rocket Squad is bursting free and shrinking my Robo-Legionnaires into nothing with Transmut-O-Bracelets concealed in their manacles! Weissus swings his mighty Space-Mace, smashing the controls to my torturous devices! My Hypno-Scepter, forced from my grasp by Prince Kazak's Magneto-Shooto-Beam! Julian Van August, running free into the awaiting arms of... CRUM?
Then, who is the prisoner suspended above the Flames Of Hate? What? Emitting the telltale sparks and ear-smoke of an android double? Drat! It's nothing more than a simple robo-mannequin decoy! 
Aiyeee! The Spaceship Gallant, with Princess Angela at the helm, is dive-bombing the Great Celestial Palace! Billowing clouds of space-smoke! Crowds running everywhere! Kaff! I'm choking! Kaff, kaff! Victory has—kaff—slipped through my fingers—kaff, kaff!—once again! Kaff, kaff!—CURSE YOU, CRUM kaff 375! Kaff! CURSE kaff YOU kaff FOREVER! Kaff, kaff, kaff, kaff...

No, I will make sure that will be removed permanently.  I will not do this for awhile to avoid violations, but hope that someone else will consider and agree.  There is no reason whatsoever to put """"the late"""" in front of his name, I will list several reasons, and although I think that is somewhat POV, there are other reason as to why I remove the info:
Everyone dies sometime - Does it really make sense to have an article about a past event and just put """"the late"""" in front of everyone that has died?
Poor writing - It's just sloppy/filler writing to put """"the late"""" in place.  Would you ever see anyone referred to as """"the late"""" in a print encyclopedia?
Recentism - WP has a guideline/template that we should try not to capitalize too much on recent events and keep them in perspective.  Would it make sense 10 years down the road to still refer to him as """"the late""""?  Let's make things as static as possible.
Precedent - At one point, several dozen articles referred to Steve Irwin as """"The late Steve Irwin"""", now, this is the only one that does (by doing a search), and there seems to be consensus about that.
Knowledge of his death - Let's face it, a vast majority of people (especially those that would look for this article) know he is dead, and the few that may not be sure can click the link.  Maybe people don't want to know that he's dead or be reminded of it, and putting that acts as a spoiler.  Even Anna Nicole Smith had a few """"the lates"""" put on pages of hers, and those have all been removed (a few by me, a few by others). """"Saving a click"""" is not a valid reason for this, we should assume that the readers are smart, and things like that can go to the Simple English edition.
Irrelevance - Why would the fact that he is dead be relevant to an article that talks about his programming?  His shows will probably be reran for many years to come, and the fact that he died somewhat unexpectedly makes no bearing on what he did on his programming.

Well, this is my case, I would also like to point out WP:OWN, which I feel has been violated in these reverts.  I also am starting a discussion on WP:Words To Avoid to get some word from other editors to make sure that I am doing the right thing.  I am supremely confident that I am, and I look forward to improving the PETA article in the future.  """,0.0

"Invitation to workshops on Wikipedia editing
Dear Ploversegg,

We are a team of researchers at the University of Oxford and AU Sharjah, researching the experiences of editors of content about the Arab world on Wikipedia. We are interested in your experiences of editing Wikipedia and are organising two events that we think you would be an excellent contributor to.

First, starting next week on Monday 27th August, we are hosting an online discussion about what it is like to contribute to Wikipedia in Arabic and to articles about the Middle East and North Africa. We are interested in what barriers you perceive to exist in Wikipedia, how articles can be made better and generally what can be done to expand and improve Arabic Wikipedia. This discussion will take place on a MediaWiki hosted at our institution and be available in English and Arabic. We will allow users to create their own discussion pages in addition to our discussions.

Second, we are hosting face-to-face workshops in Cairo from 21st-22nd October 2012. If you are interested in this we may be able to pay your travel and accommodation costs depending on where you live. This workshop will cover similar themes to the online discussion but will allow participants to meet one another and benefit from being together.  

We will take care of the organization and planning and all you have to do is show up and be ready to discuss. But if you would like to help shape some of the discussion themes in advance, please let us know. We have booked time in the workshops for Wikipedian-led discussions.  

More details can be found in our “Frequently Asked Questions” section below. 

We would be delighted to welcome you to either (or both) event. Please let me know (wikiproject@oii.ox.ac.uk) if you would like to participate and we can send you more details.

Sincerely,

Mark, Bernie, Ilhem, Ali, Ahmed and Heather

Frequently Asked Questions:
 
What is the purpose of this project?

This project is about who represents the Arab World on Wikipedia, and how the Middle East and the Arab world is represented on Wikipedia. We are studying Wikipedia through statistics, edit  history data and personal experiences. Our ultimate goal is to help Wikipedia grow in size and fairness and do academic research on this topic. You can read more about the project here: http://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/research/projects/?id=70 From this page, you can also find a biography of the researchers. You may also want to see our interactive visualizations about Wikipedia here: http://wikiproject.oii.ox.ac.uk/ 

Who is funding this project?

This project is funded by the International Development Research Centre (http://www.idrc.ca). This organization is funded by the Canadian government to improve infrastructure across the world, including online content. We have been working with the IDRC since June 2010. 

Why did you contact me?

Because you’re awesome. In all seriousness, we have been looking through Wikipedia for active editors based on user activity in either Arabic Wikipedia or articles about the Arab world. We have not contacted everyone we could, but we contact people that we think will help to balance the discussion and help us (and each other) learn more about the state of Wikipedia.  

Do I need to participate in both events?

Not at all. You are welcome to participate in both or just one. We recognise that it will be more convenient for some people to have online conversations and for others to speak in person. For some people it will not be practical to fly to the Middle East, but we still consider their contributions important and want to give them a voice in this work.

Can I use my Wikipedia handle in the online discussion?

You do not need to use any particular name on the online forum. All we need is a valid email address so you can register. You can post using your real name, your Wikipedia name or a completely different nickname, whatever allows you to speak your mind most effectively. 

What sort of travel funding will you supply for the face-to-face workshop?

We have funding for travel and accommodation costs for approximately twenty participants depending on where they are coming from. If you would like to join us in one of the face-to-face meetings then we wi",0.0

The best dictionaries give 'race' so one has to retain it. In any case it was coined as a term by Haeckel when race discourse was emerging. You can't actually put """"and"""", as if the two related words had a double denomination, one of which is 'race' (esp. in the modern sense, which the Greeks lacked). φῦλον can also mean a 'class'  as in 'the class of women' or 'the class/species of flies'. φυλή, a more prosaic term, refers to an organized institutional body of men, united by belief in common blood or descent.

 From WP:ANI 

Hi, all.  Now that I know that this discussion exists, I'd like to contribute.

I'll say three things briefly, then answer any questions.  First, I have no intention of making any phone calls in the future.  Second, I am absolutely certain that my actions in no way threatened the privacy of any editors and therefore was not an example of WP:OUT.  Third, please note the context of this accusation.   

 Ok, here's the context: your supporters feel that the phone call to someone's place of business does not belong in the RFC.  Fine then, based on the section of WP:NPA that I have quoted both in our discussion on my talkpage, and I believe I left it in the RFC, this is an issue that requires immediate intervention - if there is indeed action to be taken.  Indeed, when I became aware of the situation in the RFC, I should have brought it here myself.  You have had about a full day since the end of the interactions on my talkpage to reflect - based on the above, I'm not sure you used the time wisely. (talk→  ←track) 

A couple of weeks ago, I voluntarily revealed the fact that I did this research, while carefully avoiding any revelation of private information.  My motivation was to demonstrate that yet another checkuser conviction was mistaken.
Weeks passes without a whisper, until the now-departed User:Paularblaster digs it up to try to add substance to an unpersuasive RfC/CU that he and Schrandit launched.  There was no haste or cause for it, just an ax to grind.
Now, I said outright that I won't be doing this again, and whether or not you agree with the action, there was never any potential to harm anyone, much less an intent to do so.  All this talk about a """"chilling effect"""" is well-meaning but simply mistaken.  No matter how you add it up, the situation is one that requires calm reflection, not urgent action, because there's a risk of knee-jerk reaction without actually understanding what happened.
Now, I'm going to ask you, Bwilkins, the question you refused to answer before, and which you deleted from your talk page.  Bwilkins, how could my phone call have caused anyone to lose their job?   

(@ CarolineWH) Do you understand why we would be concerned with your off wiki sleuthing, and how that could have a chilling effect?  In other areas it would be bad enough, but considering that you are editing abortion-related articles (some of which likely document the murders or stalking of abortion providers) makes it more so.   

If there was ever any risk of private information being revealed, then I'd agree.  But there wasn't, so no, there is no chilling effect.  As for abortion, it's a red herring, as the two editors I researched had nothing to do with the issue.  I would add that this is not a matter of stalking someone I disagree with, but confirming that they were innocent of sockpuppetry.   

(ec):It was uncalled for sleuthing. You clearly indicate investigating the workplace of either Spotfixer or Phil Specter, even if it eventually didn't turn out to be their workplace. Had it happened to me, I would consider such intrusive investigations into my private life just to one-up me in a content dispute, harassment. Despite saying you won't make such phone calls in the future, I see no indication that you understand how serious and inappropriate it was.  

If I had determined that either of them were Spotfixer, I'd have bit my tongue to protect their privacy and allow RfCU to properly convinct them.  The scenario you described would indeed be chilling, but it has nothing to do with the reality of what I did.  Again, unless you can show how my actions were even potentially harmful, it's hard for me to consider them either serious or inappropriate.  I agreed not to do it again, but that doesn't mean that what I did was wrong.

"Ooooh, here's our Swiss neutralist! And what does this administrator bring to the table this time? Let's see, accusations of parroting, arbitrary classification of users based upon pen-name preferences, straw-men, ignoratio elenchi, and finally begging the question through the same fallacious reasoning as previously. We call that petitio principii, don't we? Apparently nothing will change his mind until I change my pen-name to something like John Doe. How does he know that I am not this Russian dude who likes Iranian history and culture? Oh, that's right, he doesn't. He probably didn't check my IP-address to see that I'm based in Sweden and could in fact be a Swede. Whoops... Sounds like our neutralist is using a subtle profiling method to his convenience.

Like I stated before, it doesn't matter if I'm a Nazi, Communist, Liberal or even a hippie. It doesn't matter if I do drugs, or if I look even remotely like a reptile. It doesn't matter if I'm even an obese Tongan kid. It has no bearing on content or the essentials of an argument, and anything else you might conjure to the favour of some imagined affiliation. This is aptly called speculation.

Now, I will only say two things. First one is a rehearsal of my previous suggestion: Livius.org is visited by thousands of people daily. Along with a number of other scholar-related websites, I can't live without checking it by a daily basis. It deserves a Wiki-article, where Jona Lendering is briefly described as the founder and maintainer of an outlet with roots as far back as -96. Yes, sounds like a plan of revenge. The paragon of Pan-Iranic resurgence! The removal of a Wiki-article of Lendering will remove the last great obstacle to a resurgent Achaemenid empire and the reawakening of the terrifying Persian horsemen of doom! Howl! Howl! Our world is forfeit!

Second point, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart: Get laid. Your superior-inferior complex isn't convincing anyone here, whether they be Iranian or not. There is no chance an article of this quality gets to stay. That's the bottom line, irrespective of any perceived reasoning. Either change the article so that it pertains to Livius.org, or stop your incessant whining. Maybe it never occurred to you that by simple observation Jona Lendering has written several Iran-friendly articles and has generally sought to dispel several popular misconceptions on the ancient Iranians. Maybe that's how you make more drama in your life, by arbitrary holier-than-thou attitude.

1. The Patchett AfD was logged [here]
2. Her page clearly states that she's from Western Australia, and that she's listed in the category for People from Perth, Western Australia
3. Dan has a long history of editing pages about WA.
Obviously I can't say for certain how Dan came to edit the page, and I have no idea at all if he would recognise the name and follow through after seeing it in the log, nor if he even saw the log, but I can say that there are other possibilities than the one LibStar suggests. Unless LibStar has other evidence that isn't posted here, I don't really see how he or she can be so confident that Dan is in the wrong. ¶ Now, for the record, before I'm accused of something, I'll note that I've been editing some of the same pages as Dan since 2007.

"""Today I made a change to some of the wording in this section, based on the notion that a """"right"""" is inherent/inalienable and is thus not something which can be conferred, rather only acknowledged and protected, at least when talking about law, social contracts and a political candidate's position in regard to such matters. In particular, phrases like """"Kerry wants to grant rights to homosexuals"""" (which I removed altogether) I find to be somewhat sub-NPOV. The position of the GLBT community is not unlike that of women and minorities in previous eras: that they have rights that are not being recognized or equally protected. I suppose a truly neutral phrasing would acknowledge that some people feel that such rights do not exist and thus do not deserve broad legal protections or social recognition. I opted to just remove the most contentious phrase, which was redundant anyway, and to add qualifiers to another phrase to reflect the Jeffersonian POV w.r.t. inalienable rights.

I can't understand Jeffro77's first objection. Nowhere do I see a claim in the text that anyone other than the committee are the authors of their translation. The committee do announce explicitly that a privilege was granted to them. They are not thanking men for this. We have to adopt a scrupulously NPOV in quoting the donor of that privilege. It is a notable item of Jehovah's belief that all the books of the Bible have a single author in contrast to mainstream Christianity that acknowledges a number of authors at different times. But I choose to say """"a heavenly Author, not the heavenly Author, to avoid getting into loaded and POV consideration of that Author being unique or not.

To Jeffro77's second objection, it is clear that Jeffro77 takes """"inspired"""" to mean """"divinely informed"""" and that Jeffro77 deduces from known dates of publication, that Jehovah's Witnesses include their own translation NWT among the 1 300 or 1 800 uninspired ones. I have no argument against that logic. However it may be too near WP:SYN because the Jehovah's Witnesses may not intend or even be aware of that argument's logic. Unless someone provides an source that says explicitly that the NWT is among the uninspired translations, we may not generate our own criticism this way.

 Defacing compliant sigs 

This edit has been partially reverted as it changed two users' compliant signatures on a project page without prior discussion with the users. Since the only apparent motivation for your edit is to supplant WP:SIG#Customizing your signature (an official guideline) with your personal preferences, this constitutes vandalism, and this response constitutes a warning. Please do not alter others' presentations of data without cause, in violation of WP:POINT, creating the very squabbles you claim to wish to avoid in favor of actually writing an encyclopedia.  
Well, """"Vandalism is any addition, deletion, or change to content made in a deliberate attempt to reduce the quality of the encyclopedia."""" I don't see Tony's edits as vandalism (even in an extended sense), though the last few seemed to have a bit of spite and muse to them, which I don't like. 

 If any of my edits have given the impression of spite that was an error. I am aware of no spite.  I only seek to improve the encyclopedia. 

 I don't think you quite understand.   Any discussion can be improved by refactoring.  This will inevitably involve, as a desired end product, reduction of noise, the most obvious of which is unnecessary content in signatures, """"compliant"""" (whatever that might mean) or not.  Discussions are about, believe it or not, the exchange of information, not the repeated depositing of random graffiti on pages devoted to discussion of a subject not related to that graffiti.

 I'm running out of polite ways to say """"you are behaving  in an incredibly stupid manner; please reconsider your approach to Wikipedia.""""  -Tony Sidaway 

Hey, Tony, per our Wikien-L discussion... if you're pissing people off seriously when you do it, knock off doing it.  The cure is worse than the illness, when you piss them off.   

Tony has more guts than I do...I am constantly tempted to help save server lag by """"fixing"""" signatures. 

I'm not saying they're not annoying.  But I am saying, and have said (with a chorus of agreements, but not unanimity) on Wikien-L that the consequences of getting people angry by refactoring sigs in a manner they believe is abusive is worse than the consequences of leaving the sigs as is.  There's been discussion about a signature size limit, which I support, in some form or another.  But the side effects of refactoring a bunch of random people's sigs are that they're percieving it as abuse by Tony, not as a cleanup effort, and reasonable people should always think twice if people complain that they're being abusive.
The proper solution to this has to either be Tony being a lot more polite about the refactoring (for example, telling people on their talk pages, nicely asking them to change, ec), or for there to be a policy change that limits sig size so there's no question as to whether the refactor is """"ok"""" or not.  Tony irritating people when he's acting fully in compliance with policy is acceptable to me.  Tony irritating or abusing people when policy has gotten vague on a point, is not.

You drift into pure editorializing; this needs some other formulation that isn't a pure projection of your opinion and/or personal experiences. I happen to be a champion within the Waldorf movement of revising the emphasis on the eight-year class teacher period. But the opposite of """"brochure speak"""" is """"antagonist speak""""; both may make statements that appear clear, objective and meaningful to the person making them - but are too broad and too vague simultaneously. It is """"weasel"""" language; unattributed, both unprovable and undisprovable. """"  The percentage of teachers who make it through 8 years with a single class is staggeringly LOW - so what starts as a lofty goal often ends up as an interruption of the children's education - and often under difficult circumstances.  Making the claim that a teacher stays with the class for 8 years is brochure speech not supported by reality.  It's like saying - """"it is the intention of each baseball player to bat 1000"""".  It is meaningless except for the purpose of sucking people into a set of ideals that aren't part of reality.

I don't disagree that this is part of the pedagogy, but the wording has to be concise.  """"Essential for the child's healthy development and emotional security"""" - you sound like Donald Rumsfeld with your terrorist scare tactics here.  Yes, let's all just scare the parents into Waldorf education.  How about just saying """"rhythms during the day and through the year are thought to be important""""?  What you wrote above is the type of brochure speech that riddles this article and makes it impossible to view it as other than a advertisement.

I have not been reverting your edits generally; only blatant editorializing (which I have sometimes managed to convert into something meaningful)."""" Your """"middle ground"""" and mine are in very different places, my friend.  Blatant editorializing is what my edits have been removing.  Just because I haven't had time to go back and re-word what you believe you have made """"meaningful"""" doesn't mean it has any validity in this article.  As long as you, a Waldorf teacher, is here making this article """"meaningful"""" - there will be no end to the controversy here.

""""The tag should go because it is presently unjustified, as you all agree; it is inaccurate in its present form; why are you advocating keeping something that is not accurate? If it becomes accurate, it should go back; that's easy enough to do."""" Nobody agrees - as far as I know, with what you have said above - although one polemic editor besides yourself did remove the tag.  The tag is completely justified.  Here's the next paragraph that needs brochure speech removed: 

""""According to Steiner, the child at this early stage learns through imitation and example,[4] so in Waldorf it is considered best to surround him with the goodness of the world and caring, practically active adults to emulate. The curriculum attempts to awaken the child's will and initiative; the teacher has the responsibility for providing an environment that stimulates imitation. In Waldorf, such an environment is believed to support the physical and spiritual growth of the child. Formal learning is absent, and experiences of the written language are consciously avoided. Oral language development is addressed through circle games (songs, poems and games in movement), daily story time (normally recited from memory) and the range of practical activities.""""

And there are more and more similar paragraphs that require lots of work.  I'm sorry if it is offensive to you as a Waldorf teacher, to find out that lots and lots of people besides you feel it is best to surround children with goodness.  In fact, maybe you should point out schools who, as their goal, consider it best to surround children with something other than goodness.  There is absolutely no justification for removing the tag while this type of language fills the article.  There was, at one time, a promise of a re-write of the article (most of which, I belie",0.0

On the """"about"""" page at the website of the Australian Haiku Society mention of Kacian is curiously absent, and we read simply, """"In December, 2000, Australian haiku enthusiasts banded together to form HaikuOz""""; regarding Slovenia, we read on the site of the German Haiku Society that """"The Haiku Club of Slovenia (HCS) was set up in September 1997"""" i.e. 3 years prior to Kacian's trip; in Serbia, there are two societies: the Aleksandar Nejgebauer Haiku Club was formed in 1993 according to their page on Templibres, and the Serbian Haiku Society was founded in 2004, according to this page on Tempslibres. According to this page on WHC, the Bulgarian Haiku Club was formed in 1999. 

In light of all the above, we're going to need something more than a statement from Kacian himself if we want to retain this claim. Can anyone help?  """,0.0

So we're back at the point we were before - is there something special about the relationship between Hagos and Biasutti that allows this transfer of expertise just by citation? My point is that it takes years of training, experience and recognition by others in the field to be considered an expert in that field. You seem to be saying Hagos got it just by citing Biasutti. If David Attenborough cited Niels Bohr would he become an expert in Physics? No he wouldn't, he'd just be an expert in biology who happened to cite an expert in physics once - we wouldn't be able to accept anything he said about quantum mechanics or block holes as fact until we checked it with a genuine expert in the field. So what makes you think Hagos has become an expert in human skin colour just by citing Biasutti? And remember that the policy doesn't just state """"expert"""",  it states """"established expert in the topic whose previous work in the field has been published by reliable third-party publications"""" - unless you are you going to argue that Hagos got Biasutti's reputation and previous publications as well I think this is a dead end argument. You should accept that Hagos doesn't meet the criteria laid down by the WP policy for the creators of self-published sources.
If you don't think that Hagos chose the colours for each country then who do you think did it? They didn't just magically change due to """"migration trends"""" - somebody made a decision that colour X goes in country Y. From the evidence we have it would appear that Hagos was the one who made that decision - it certainly wasn't made by Biasutti or the writers of the national census data that he cites as his sources.
It makes no difference to the situation so I won't argue it, but for the record I don't accept that Hagos is a recognised expert on migration.

 Pocket billards 

The term pocket billiards is used inconsistently in the article. Does it mean:
""""Pool or pocket billiards, generally played on a table with six pockets ..."""" where pocket billiards links to pool (cue sports)
or is it a generic name for all billiard [type] games played on a table with pockets as in its is used in the section Cue sports#Major games (carom and pocket). Because if the latter then the former is confusing and is further confused by the hatnote:

(Where """"Pocket billiards"""" links to Pool (cue sports)).

In a similar way the section Cue sports#List of cue sports says that """"English billiards (another hybrid)"""" of  """"Carom billiards games"""", but in the previous talk section we have established that it is not a hybrid (as it is at least as old as all modern billiard games and modern pocket-less Carom games), and if """"Snooker (see below; popularly regarded as its own sport, not a pool variant)"""" is its own sport so is English billiards.

If it can not be decided what """"Pocket billiards"""" means in American English and Commonwealth English then we should avoid using the term, or define what we mean by it before it is used in the article. Also I do not think that sources over 30 years old, should be used to define a term like """"Pocket billiards"""" as language changes and usage of such phrases does as well. Eg if the American professional organisations  have been pressing for it to mean pool type games, and snooker professional organisations tend not to use the term, then it is probably better to define it that American way and stick with that American usage in an article such as this.

If """"Pocket billiards"""" turns out not to have one meaning, and a definition can not be agreed upon then perhaps we should alter the section Cue sports#List of cue sports so that the list is either by table type sections, or by section based on the governing bodies of the various sports.

Yeah, I think I wrote most of that section some years ago (although I didn't give it the heading """"Summary"""", which makes it sound more definitive than I perhaps meant).

The rest is not incredibly straightforward as a lot of the most recent research is not in widely available reliable sources. I think Bane's stuff is fine as far as it goes, especially his summary of other people's research, but it's not a published book. Strickland and Hardy is probably the most authoritative, but it is a little out of date. Having said that, they came to fairly similar conclusions to later writers, if you ignore the outlying Primitive Archer test. Rogers' stuff looking at armour thickness on the limbs is also interesting, but again, it's in an appendix of another work.

 GREEN POLITICS AND BIAS CLOUDS THIS ARTICLE. 

Too much of this article is about petty environmental politics and in-fighting, with a bias against Moore.

The article should be about the man and his views, not about why some environmentalists disagree with him. Much of the latter part of the article has the tone of putting up Moore for criticism and then criticising him. The section """"Criticism by other environmentalist"""" does not belong at all, certainly not as a seperate section. The article should not be a """"for"""" and """"against"""" debate.

It is petty politics when some environmentalists object against describing him as an """"environmentalist"""" simply because he has alternate views on method and tactics (albeit critical views).

Example of bias:
Under the heading """"Views"""", we do not get an insight into Moore's views, (vision, ideology, tactics, philosophy etc), what we get is only Moore's views in opposition to the environmental movement.

An example of subtle bias:

""""Moore is supported by the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI), a national organization of pro-nuclear industries which hopes to enlist Moore's help in bringing about a nuclear renaissance.[22]""""

(Note that the link [22] is broken).
The fact that an organisation supports Moore, and """"hope"""" to enlist him, does not establish any alliance between Moore and them.
This is clearly an attempt to establish guilt by association, by those who are against nuclear as a green option. 
The factual information is as follows (from Wikipedia):
""""NEI founded the Clean and Safe Energy Coalition (CASEnergy) to help build local support around the country for new nuclear build. The co-chairs of the coalition are Greenpeace co-founder Patrick Moore..""""

The statement in this article should be replaced by stating Moore's proper association and the relevant context i.e. why he supports them or what they stand for, e.g. Clean and Safe Energy.""",0.0

"I want to share something with you 

Here is a poem that details something I think you'll find educational.  After checking over your behavior on Wikipedia a little bit, I think you might be interested in what it's like to have a penis.  Your incessant edit warring (that you childishly deny), and your infuriating, relentless self-importance are all the evidence that I need to conclude that you either a) don't have a penis (much like Gwen Gale) or b) possess such a small penis that it just doesn't count.  Anyway, enjoy this poem - just for you.

I'll tell you a short poem; I'll try to make it quick. The subject is quite simple: The joy of having a dick.

Penises are super things; Daedalus969 should be jealous. An organ surrounded by sensitive skin. That's smooth and rarely hairless

It starts to grow dramatically, When you're about thirteen. Your testicles on either side; Your willy in between.

It dangles neatly down below; Soft, obedient and loyal. At the slightest hint of lust, It's ready to uncoil.

It often has a mind all of its own; It's like a wild untamed beast. It squirms and writhes and stretches out; When you expect it least.

Sometimes, yes, it misbehaves; Erecting when it shouldn't. A bumpy train ride sets it off; Just when you wish it wouldn't.

And during the summer, wearing little, sunning on the beach. The slightest sight of shaking boobs Makes it squirm just like a leech.

Handle it with love and care; For it can give great pleasure. Has it grown since last weekend? And when did you last measure?

Some people fret about its size; They give it lots of thought. Is thirteen inches long enough? It makes guys quite distraught.

They peek across in urinals, To compare and try to see But if another glances back at them. There's no way they can pee.

Masturbating is a sin; That's what some folk believe. But those are just old wives' tales; Cuz it really can relieve.

Without this fabulous organ, No shag would be complete. Lesbians will try their best; But must admit defeat.

It has to main bodily functions I'm sure you'll all agree. To start a whole new life and of course daily to pee

But I think the thing that's marvellous; About that one eyed brute. Is that when its trying to procreate, It knows which fluid to shoot

And always it remains with you; Until you're old and frail. Don't take it out in public though, or you'll be thrown in jail.

And so to summarise I'd say with certainty, that every male loves his little friend But girls, no matter what we do, Please don't fold, spindle mutilate and NEVER NEVER Bend!!!",0.0

In James 1:8 the Bible states that """"A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.""""
What does that even mean? not that it's wrong to be there. I'd just like an explanation. might as well use 6 and 7

James 1:6 But let him ask in faith, without any doubting, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, driven by the wind and tossed.

James 1:7 For let that man not think that he will receive anything from the Lord.

James 1:8 He is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.

or the whole 10 lines

1 James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are in the Dispersion: Greetings. 2 Count it all joy, my brothers, when you fall into various temptations, 3 knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance. 4 Let endurance have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing. 5 But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach; and it will be given to him. 6 But let him ask in faith, without any doubting, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, driven by the wind and tossed. 7 For let that man not think that he will receive anything from the Lord. 8 He is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways. 9 But let the brother in humble circumstances glory in his high position; 10 and the rich, in that he is made humble, because like the flower in the grass, he will pass away.

So.. it looks like double-minded in 1-8 is refering to faith and having no doubt in 1-6. But it doesn't say anything about knowing. Or is knowing without having doubt? Can you be without doubt and still say u don't know? that sounds possible """"i don't know but i don't doubt it""""

Is theism only refering to christianity? or does it not matter anyway if only christianity is right? i don't think that would be NPOV

By the way, isn't God supposed to be beyond our comprehension? and if so, how can u know what god is if it's god is beyond our comprehension? and agnosticism is probably used more to say about knowing if god exsists, but i guess knowing what is god is part of knowing ultimate reality. hmm..

"Articles for Deletion 

I realize you are not happy with the current turn of events. However, in a project like Wikipedia, where pretty much everyone can post anything, and challenge anything, it happens. Sometimes edit wars devolve into situations like this.

The deletion debate process has to be available to prevent people from cluttering up Wikipedia with all sorts of stuff. Some can abuse the process; some can resort to it in good faith and turn out to be wrong.

Personally, I have no knowledge of whether this is a prominent web server or not. I don't know whether the other party is just being antagonistic or really believes Zeus is not worthy of inclusion. There is a Wikipedia policy to try to assume good faith on the part of everyone, whenever possible. To respond by going after other products, or attacking Boborok, would be a mistake.

The proper way to handle it is to gather information to bolster your case. Look for industry publications that have written articles about Zeus (note: not forums, they don't carry much weight). Any statistics you can find (again from reliable sources) on the prevalence of the software would help. Post links in the Articles for Deletion discussion so that others can review them. You will find that other Wikipedia editors are reasonable people, and if you make your case, calmly and reasonably, you will find it listened to. Forget about Boborok, and whatever his motives may be. Concentrate on the subject at hand.

Huge numbers of articles are nominated for deletion but kept, and once that happens it becomes much, much harder for anyone to try to nominate them again.

Hope this helps.",0.0

 A quesiton about material allowed on userpages 

here you said,  """"The userpage, or userspace, is not to be used to house a list of misdeeds of another user, unless it is going to be used in dispute resolution, such as RfC.""""

An aside, before I ask my question, I tried to provide dispute resolution in that incident, but my involvement was based upon my assumption that Drolz was concerned about being blocked, and wanted to assemble evidence should that occur. Turns out my fears  were right, he was blocked, but he wasn't amassing Vir quotes for that reason, so I dropped out of the discussion.

I can understand why WP would want to discourage collections of misdeeds, but I can also understand why prohibiting it might equally be a problem. I haven't reached my own conclusions on what the policy should be.

Back to my question (after pointing out that I am familiar with WP:OSE)—do you think  is compliant with or a violation of the policy statement you made?

The genesis of this page was as the cobbled together embarrassment of an article List of Charmed episodes as it was constituted around the new year of 2009.

Subsequently, the list of episodes was split out into four seasons pages, and concurrently work began transforming that page into a page with a table of articles, without the synopses, which will be handled by pages like this one.
These subpages are named to form the series links:

 Lecher lines 

Do you have any thoughts on the subject of tuned circuits for UHF/SHF, I am planning on expanding the page a little to make it more useful.

Yes, But I have to gather my thoughts. The trouble is that you have reverted some of my corrections to this page in your addition. Can you pleae be more careful when adding material that you dont destroy peoples improvements? BTW can you please sign your posts by typing four tildes so we know who to reply to. Thanks. 

I think that a clear need exists for the division between balanced and unbalanced transmission lines. Many aerials are balanced such as the centre fed half wave dipole, these aerials can be fed using a balanced line which is connected directly to the some old equipment or via a balun in the shack. The other option is to use a balun near the feed point of the aerial and an unbalanced feeder (This arrangement normally leads to higher losses, but it is more EMC friendly). While the use of long runs of balanced feeder is something which many people outside of the radio community are unaware of, it is a concept which is very important and WP will be better if such things are included.

Sorry I overwrote any improvements which another editor made, but I was reverting some changes which had made the lecher line section into dire state where it was not in the correct order. 

Yes but we dont want to turn it into page on Ham radio solely- its about transmission lines. Sounds like we need a page on aerial matching however, aerial feeders (bal and unbal) are I think are appropriate on this page.",0.0

"Doc Holliday Photo Problem

Yes, I know that that photo of the dark-haird man you used is on file in Denver as Doc Holliday. A different photo (see the collar) from the same photo session with the same man actually hangs in the Cochise County Courthouse in Tombstone, and is also labeled Holliday. But it isn't.

The only authentic closeup we have of Holliday is the one in Karen Tanner's book Doc Holliday: A Family Portrait. A standing picture we have of poor quality from 1879 shows he's still the same man by then (still light-haired, as Wyatt says). More importantly, the two closeups we have are of men with different ears.

See my note on the Doc Holliday discussion page. It behooves us to get a no-question photo of the real J. Holliday on Holliday's wiki page!  You can leave the other one in, but include a caption that due to the ears, some do not consider it authentic. You can then let the reader judge.",0.0

 Comments on Talk:Ashurism 

Hi Elias.  You made a few comments on the above talk page, such as """"Damn Garzo, no offence, and I do mean this in a positive way, but you're truly a pain in the ass )"""", """"You are obviously, like most Wikipedians, an enemy of Freedom of Speech, you have issues with someone questioning your motives, and you are also a hypocrite"""", and """"That's really, because you are an old man, Garzo. You know, a little stiff. Again, no offence, but you should stop taking yourself too seriously, you know, be a little bit more humble. """".  While none of these are, taken in context, especially offensive, your tone was flippant and unhelpful (and bordering on rude in the second example, with some unfair accusations of racism also made).

"Can you cite a reputable scholarly source (not other Christian groups, which would of course reject this group, just as they often reject each other) that states an assessment that PC is NOT a form of Christianity. I do not think this fact is disputed unless there is a fringe view of what is means to be a Christian, which excludes other forms. I do not think this can be excluded as a form of Christianity without committing some basic problems in logic in regards to this definition, in particular the No True Scotsman fallacy. Until you have a good source that not only makes the case but represents the scholarly consensus on the question of a definition of Christianity that is sufficiently inclusive but still exclusive of PC as one of its manifestations of the religion, we do not get to delete the factual statement that PC is a form of Christianity. At most we can state that it is disputed, which Giovanni has done. It does not make any claim regarding the compatibility of Christianity with Nazism, but it does say that PC is a form of Christianity that is consistent with Nazism. If you dispute this, then please state what part parts of PC are not consistent with Nazism as an ideology?

 Hello 

Hi I'm a new Wikipedian from Natick... just popped in to say hello to a neighbor: 

    

Hi I Am Marc:
I was recently married to my lovely wife; 
We have lived together for several years already... 
We love cats (3 currently own us)... Jeffy(15), Echo(6) & Gizmo(3). All sleep with us in the big bed and no room to move an inch.    
I was Disabled in a 1993 (Coma)/ and am very slowly recovering. It's tough going out sometimes, though with friends I still do. I have a few supportive friends.  
I am an """"Unenrolled voter."""" Democrat/ Republicans, I don't care, whoever serves makes my life better in the long run I vote for! 
Avid reader. Has collection of many hundreds of rare books. Especially Science Fiction and Fantasy. 
Avid Music collector (2,500 albums)...mostly bootlegs...mostly rare bootlegs...Stones, Kinks, Clapton, Beatles. and solos! 

I am what I am
I'm strongly opinionated about disabled peoples' rights and jobs for American citizens who have trouble finding minimum wage jobs in my state today and support Universal health care, I would be dead if I did not have it. I am an idiot about Internet social skills. I hope that the Immigration Reform bill will protect disabled citizens who wish to work like myself first before considering allowing new people to come here. I was searching for an internet forum to be my outlet to express my needs, but found that Wikipedia is not best suited for that. I'm brushing up on Wikipedia's rules of conduct, and slowly starting to begin contributing again.

"There exist lots of pages which contain incorrect information. One example, White Wave Bandits is one of them.

Yufuluo is now deleted by the simple reason that Benjitheijneb could not find the relavent information.. I recommend you not to edit Dong Cheng page. Instead you'd better to edit White wave bandits.

 Republic of Korea 

It's irritating to that this page is titled """"South Korea"""", which is nothing more than a regional designation. Maybe a page on the unique geographical or cultural/historical happenings on the southern part of the Korean peninsula would be accurately named, but there doesn't seem to be a good reason not to redirect to Republic of Korea. China, for instance, isn't the page name for the People's Republic of China. There are plenty of other counter examples, of course, Japan being the name of the page for the State of Japan, or Zimbabwe for the Republic of Zimbabwe, or a dozen others, but these names are so close to their formal names as to only designate the form of government. Because of the DPRK and ROK's mutual use of the term 'Korea', this isn't a satisfactory alternative. """"South Korea"""" reads increasingly anarchronistic, a vestigal designation from the Korean war when the difference between the two countries was most importantly location-geographic in the sense of military holdings, and a division which was supposed to be temporary. Does anyone have thoughts on this, or an argument why we shouldn't use a nation's preferred English designation for itself? 210.103.36.58  """,0.0

Hey Sue Anne, how are you?

Hope you are as fine as always.

Looks like the petty cabal has been upto something on my IP userpage. LOL.

Some of the cabal must have jumped in, looking at the edit history, maybe because they were smarting when I pointed out their ways. LOL. I feel bad for them, they must have been nursing their grudges for long. LOL.

Your message in my support and other messages have been deviously deleted by one of the cabal. LOL.
Would you be bothered enough to put it in place again?
The cabal obviously want to paint the issue their way. HAHAHAHAHA.

I did not read a single message on my usertalk page after your nice supportive message because I already knew it must be full of the cabal's unmentionable things. LOL. I only noted the names of the cabal and had a big laugh.

A few things did come out of the incident.

Crossmr meekly submitted that he had not blocked me.
He further admitted in so many of his own words that he had not even read the message Vesther had sent me to which I had replied, and that he had no idea about the issue, but he still sent me 1 warning and 1 message, LOL. Even after warning me and sending me another message, he did not have any idea about the issue and had not read about the issue at all!!! LOL.
He further did not even warn Vesther, but he warned me for using those words, Vesthers words, which I only used to reply to him in his own medicine.!!! LOL.

So, the result is that Crossmr has succeeded in showing himself to be UNFAIR, BIASED and grossly INCOMPETENT to be an admin. Who makes these guys admins??? LOL.

As for Mr. Royboy, LOL. The less said about him the better. LOL. HAHAHAHAHA.
Who made this guy admin? Where did he come from? Who IS he?
What explanation did he give for blocking AT THAT PARTICULAR TIME?
Me and Crossmr were just talking about his warning, which u know by now was totally wrong and biased, he was not even aware of the issue and gave an excuse of tralala, which Vesther had used!!!, and this guy turns up from nowhere?
It was a total and absolute DISGRACEFUL abuse of admin priveleges. Too bad I foiled it.
I guess he only knows how to block people without reading a single word of what people write or even understanding the issue. I sympathize with his condition.

Some people do get obsessed and have control issues with wiki I guess, Vesther being a case in point.
Is it possible that this guys a friend or a sock-puppet of an earlier aggrieved cabal member? LOL.

Anyway, the above two examples are on record, and you are the witness!!! 
And I hope next time you act strongly and correctively on such issues, I mean un-blocking.

I guess this petty cabal must have been going about this, just block, without any warning to block, and without understanding or reading anything about it, with other people, before they came across someone like me, LOL. And after that they try and make excuses and dig up old irrelevant issues which they couldnt muster up before that, as excuses. They must be quite experienced in trying to obfuscate the SPECIFIC ISSUE IN QUESTION later on. LOL.

I sincerely think that you should have exercised your right to unblock, seeing how u understood the issue, and the concerned admin or admins had no expanation for the block.

No reading, no understanding of the specific issue, no warning to the original guilty party, no warning to block, just block!!!! LOL.

But Now, they will think hard before going on about their murky ways.
LOL.

So, by extrapolating this, I have come to the conclusion that wiki is seriously and morally challenged and also lacks in competence. LOL.

All the more reason its needs me. LOL.

I wont let you down wiki. LOL.

Of course, there must be many good decent admins like you.

A few words about my messages I had sent.

With regard to Vesther, we both know what I feel about him. HAHAHAHAHA. LOL.
But to be fair, its not his fault really. Its the incompetent power-mad admin's fault who probably hit buttons from a list before even reading the messages of both parties. LOL.

Vesther just couldnt take it I guess after I repied back, giving him some of his own medicine, he just started crying. LOL. I guess he's not used to it. Maybe till now people just got bored of his obsessive ways and ignored him. LOL. Too bad. I see he has been receiving some much needed counselling from his best friend Crossmr who Did Not give him a warning for the very same words. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.

And he has further archived the discussions. Hmmmmm. Not a bad idea, when do u think I should archive that now-useless page, as it is",0.0

Thank you for your suggestion that the number of reliable references from independent sources be increased. I have added ten links and I think it has improved the article by more visibly documenting the scope of Dulvy's work. He has been interviewed and quoted in many media outlets including the New York Times and the BBC, among others, and his work has directly resulted in key policy changes (Cathay Pacific Airlines banning unsustainable shark fin soup & the listing of Manta Ray gill rakers under CITES, preventing their international trade). Please let me know if this is what you had in mind, and if the article can be improved further.",0.0

Do you mean that you blinly believe in an obviously falsified interpretation just because it is group interpretation? In other words, are you totally castrated or simply circumcised???

I repeat my great source is the mere text of the Second Commandment and I say that the WIKI does not require a better source so that any wikipedist may take the Second Commandment as specific reference, especially if this wikipedist chooses the Orhodox rabbis' translation (Paris: Editions Colbo; French Rabbinate) Sigismond, astonished to report that the four tildes do not give his signature????

"Proposed move would benefit the wider community (a copy in my talk page). 

Wikipedia is not a dictionary but an encyclopedia, therefore, the content and title name of an article there, necessarily needs to be encyclopedic, not as in the case of dictionaries. The naming of the sweet cannot straightforwardly choose as Rasgulla. However, the naming in Wikipedia appears to be followed only the Oxford dictionaries, as an anglicize name loaned from a foreign country. But the name obviously misspelled there, as the dictionary mentions rasgullā originates in Hindi – so the name to be disambiguated to avoid confusion with Rosogolla for the reasons many reliable English-language sources mentions the sweet name Rosogolla, The Oxford Companion to Sugar and Sweets describes Rosogolla is primarily associated with West Bengal, then Bengal in British India. The fact establishes the origin of the sweet is in Bengal - a part of greater India, not Hindi, in Bengal the sweet is called Rosogolla since its initial usage.  
 
Nevertheless, here rises a question, whether Wikipedia must stick to its current naming when the naming is misleading or inaccurate. 

As per description of Wikipedia, the naming the sweet should be seen as goals, not as rules. Whereas, considering the deleted article Rosogolla's naturalness, consistency, prevalence in many reliable English-language sources, as well as its usage around 250 million Bengali people in Bangladesh, West Bengal, other states in India and world over, the name Rosogolla has come into majority use. The Oxford Companion to Sugar and Sweets highlights Rosogolla, and describes often-spelled Rasgulla, it is a very new edition published in the United Kingdom and the US. The name Rosogolla has been preferred in several publications in United Kingdom and the US. Some of these books are (1) Milk - Beyond the Dairy: Proceedings of the Oxford Symposium on Food... by Harlan Walke, Page 58. (2) Strategic Management: Formulation, Implementation and Control, by PEARCE, Page 179. (3) Food Culture in India, by Colleen Taylor Sen. There are too many reliable English sources in United Kingdom and the US those mention the sweet as Rosogolla. A confusing entry in the Oxford dictionaries cannot really overlook Rosogolla’s merit as a title name from the reliable English-language sources.

Therefore, my goal is to move the article [Rasgulla]] to Rosogolla and the move would benefit a wider community.",0.0

That's a good question, Gbleem, and one that this page unfotunately does not address. The definition of biochemistry as a study only concerned with """"the molecules"""" in living systems is simply false. Both molecular biolgists and biochemists examine the intricacies of life processes, and both devote their efforts to the component molecules of these processes as well as the holistic big-picture in which they function.

Thanks for your compliments. I don't remember much more about Admiral Makarov than what I wrote in the stub. I agree with the need of consistency in transliteration. I think, however, that when some Russian term is already established in English, the established transliteration should take precedence of the letter by letter rule. My impression (not confirmed though a thorough search though) is that Kniaz iz a more common English usage of the Russian word Князь. However, the google counts for kniaz and knyaz are close enough, so my impression is rather subjective. Also, the article you refered me to gives two choices for transliteration of Великий as both Velikiy"""" or Veliky''. The former term seems better to me, but again this is rather subjective. What do you think? I would be happy to abide with a consensus decision in the future. Regards, Irpen 21:30, Mar 18, 2005 (UTC)""",0.0

Hey there. As the current Major Events Coordinator and planner of the SUNY Purchase Culture Shock festival, I am a bit dismayed to see that the page has been deleted.

"""
Now this is the kind of approach to discussion I like. What we need to do is find a way to keep track of all these issues, discuss them (separately or in clusters  whatever works best in various cases), then figure out how to implement what we decide, etc. Now, I really have to get to work now (sometimes I go to work in the middle of the night  quieter, no distractions) but let me quickly suggest the following. Would you mind if, later, I reorder these to bring related issues together, maybe group them into headings, and number them? Then it can be a kind of master checklist while we open separate discussion threads on each issue or cluster, referring to them by number, etc. As new issues come up we can add them under the appropriate heading in the list, and come back to it later if need be. Also, if we get stuck on something (e.g. """"Need to get book X at library"""" or """"EEng and CG decided to take a break on this one before they kill each other"""") we can just note that in the list as the status for that issue, and switch to another issues for a while. Would that be OK? I'd like to be the one to set up this organization, just because (I hope you will agree) I have a better mastery of all the """"moving parts"""" in the Gage story and how they fit together.
In the meantime though, if you're eager to get started ASAP, let me ask you about two of your points so far:

The idea that modern Egyptians (who are predominantly Caucasian) are descendants of ancient Egyptians is, I would wager, currently the most widespread view of the problem among scholars: Egyptian Egyptologists, Hawass foremost among them, are particularly vehement about this. Claiming that initially Egyptians were black Africans, but were later replaced with Caucasian invaders is an extraordinary claim that requires extraordinary proof. This is why an article entitled """"Controversy over race of ancient Egyptians"""" exists on Wikipedia.. 

Caucasian does not mean """"lily white"""" - most Caucasians are quite """"swarthy"""" in appearance, and range in color from brown (in India) to pale white (in Northern Europe).

 Posting Spoilers 
I hearby request that all spoilers be refrained from being posted in plain sight on the official Wikipedia page. Users should be forced to click a 'Show' button in order to see spoilers. I visited this page to see the background information for each houseguest, and lo and behold, Dick's exit from the house was spoiled for me. Really unfair to someone who only watches the shows, and I believe my request is more than fair.

Moved this down, now regarding spoilers according to WP:SPOILER they are allowed and just because they may """"spoil"""" a viewers experience well there is nothing Wikipedia can do. Each year this comes up but policies are policies. This comes up with every English BB but is most notable with the American version due to the fewer broadcasts per week.

Speedy deletion of Ashish (Ash) Bhardwaj
 A tag has been placed on Ashish (Ash) Bhardwaj requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

The primary goal of the case based textbook is to inform doctors of what to do when they are asked to perform different medical operations. The case based textbook only has one chapter on circumcision. Its primary goal is to inform doctors of how to react in the case they are asked to perform a circumcision. It does not give an overview of questions that have been raised about the procedure, and doesn't cover sources of controversy in the medical field (only debates). This makes it unfit to speak for this topic. Maybe it would be better to use it to highlight another statement involving controversies in the medical field.

The second source titled Controversies with one author is ok, as it does go over some medical controversies that exist, notably in consent and the parental role.

I think a better sourcing for this statement """"Ethical and legal questions regarding informed consent and autonomy have been raised over non-therapeutic neonatal circumcision.[8][9]"""" would be one that highlights significant questions from community groups in a specific demographic. If we could get a source that is clearly indicating that these questions are being raised that would be better.

Listen, I don't believe that Greece is 98% Greek. I remember reading somewhere something about official statistics finding that 10% of the population of Greece do not hold Greek citizenship (i.e. are immigrants). Perhaps the 98% figure pertains to the remaining 90% which would be something like 88.2% of the total population. I think all this speculation qualifies as original research though. What is interesting is the question of """"what are the Roma (Gypsies/Τσιγγάνοι)?"""" According to the Greek government again, they number about 200,000 - are they included in the ethnic Greeks figure? According to official statistics again (1991 census), the Thrace minority is 0.98% of the total population at that time (about 28.8% of the total population of Thace at that time). I think we should just stick with The World Factbook's estimate and avoid all the speculation. """,0.0

I feel that this article is hopelessly partisan and needs to be comprehensively re-written. It actually uses """"we"""" when talking about the event, undermining any neutrality. The tone throughout the article sounds like Wikipedia is trying to sell the event. Here are a list of examples with my notes:

 """"Spring Harvest has become much more than just an annual event — albeit the largest Christian conference in Europe."""" This is not factual and is gloating - """"much more"""".

""""2,700 Christians attended the first event - a number that grew to 38,000 in only seven years."""" """"Only"""" seven years - again, partisan opinion. 

Since its inception, Spring Harvest has had a profound impact on the life of the Church in the UK, and further afield.

It has encouraged new styles of worship. It has exposed Christians to a vast range of speakers and Church leaders from all over the world. It has helped evangelicals to recapture their commitment to social compassion, giving them a wider vision of what God is doing in the world."""" This is incredibly subjective and implies belief in God on the part of an encyclopedia.

""""This has significantly contributed to the success of Spring Harvest as it can entertain all members of the average family."""" What is the """"average"""" family and where is the factual evidence that Spring Harvest  can entertain them? Again, this sounds like a sales pitch.

The history and media coverage sections are also vague with the same unsuitable tone of laudation. To quote just one instance: """"1999: Spring Harvest raises thousands of pounds to help the victims of brutality in Kosovo."""" This is not factual enough on the charity, sum etc to be included and so is merely a sales pitch. These dates seem to be chosen to present a positive image of the event.  """,0.0

I'll clear the air here before I continue upon the current situation. 

I feel like I am being painted as the bad guy here, and that my editing and/or the editing of others is considered to be an American POV. I quote 

 Yet it was apparently Americans who started this article.

For the record. Yes I started this article. No I am not American. Such accusations that I am American and therefore my stance at maintaining the American ratings is of a POV nature are not only unfounded but unfair.

Secondly in regards to the link and image. This is no place to discuss such an issue here to begin with, and bringing it up in this situation is simply adding fuel to the fire. Furthermore it is simply a slap in the face given that just hours prior to your post I had re-opened dialogue asking for help choosing 1 of 4 new images for the infobox located here: Talk:Rookie Blue#New_Image. Since you have brought this up I have no choice but to defend myself and the editors involved about violations of NPOV. The items in question were added in this edit:  at 23:08, 17 May 2010. At the time of the edit the only available material was from the ABC. I refer you to the following two links. The first will show that the ABC Rookie Blue website was indexed on the 28 Apr 2010. The second link will show that the GlobalTV Rookie Blue website was indexed on the 12 Jun 2010. Hell I will even used google.ca:

ABC:
http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&lr;=&tbs;=qdr%3Ay&q;=%22http%3A%2F%2Fabc.go.com%2Fshows%2Frookie-blue%22&aq;=f&aqi;=&aql;=&oq;=&gs;_rfai=

Global:
http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&lr;=&tbs;=qdr%3Ay&q;=%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.globaltv.com%2Frookieblue%2Findex.html%22&aq;=f&aqi;=&aql;=&oq;=&gs;_rfai=

As you can see Logical_Fuzz did no wrong as the material from Global was not available to him/her till nearly a month later. As far as I know Logical_Fuzz is in the North American region. Specifically what nationality I am unsure of, but his/her edits were made in good faith and not in an American POV. Any further allegations that state me or other editors that have contributed to this article or the main article have violated NPOV, without proper proof backing those allegations; will not be met with too kindly.

Third. I was the one who added that is was a Canadian police drama (evidence here: ) as I accept it is a mainly a Canadian production. If I wanted to I could easily say it was a Canadian-American production. This should further dispel any such allegations that I am in violation of NPOV.

Now on with what I am to say. As I said I accept that this is mainly a Canadian Production. The page says Canadian but it also says the following:

 The series is a joint venture between Canwest Broadcasting and ABC, and produced by E1 Entertainment.

Given that Canwest also put out a joint announcement with the ABC () renewing Rookie Blue for a second season, I think it is fair to say a joint venture doesn't mean that anything American immediately takes a back seat. In regards to the """"Do not add foreign broadcasters here"""" comment. I am confused. Are you suggesting we remove the ABC as the original channel? Or have you just read it wrong and trying to argue that the picture and website don't below because it says """"Do not add foreign broadcasters here""""?

Read the first sentence of this whole exchange.

There's situations, again with Somena mentioned elsewhere, where the people and government are somewhat indeterminate and well as indistinguishable; in the Somena's case because they're not a """"legal"""" government, but one of the ancient social divisions of the peoples of the Cowichan valley; what we might call a """"chieftaincy"""" but that's an imposed concept (if you read the Somena page you'll see what I mean....I think).  Bottom line is, frankly, we're imposing a rational order based on our concepts (separate concepts) of ethnicity, language and government; in some First Nations culture that's a lot harder to do; so the Somena are NOT a First Nations government in the white man's way of thinking, or even in the thinking of the Union of BC Indian Chiefs (which is an organization of whiteman-system band governments and tribal councils created by the Indian Act, the reserve system, and Government Agents et al); but it would be touchy to exclude the Somena from equal status in a template, say, with their neighbours/kin the Quamichan.

"Wikipedia claims it is an unreliable source 

From Wikipedia's WP:RS:

Primary, secondary, and tertiary sources
 
Main page: Wikipedia:No original research#Primary, secondary and tertiary sources
 
Wikipedia articles should be based mainly on reliable secondary sources.
 
Tertiary sources such as compendia, encyclopedias, textbooks, obituaries, and other summarizing sources may be used to give overviews or summaries, but should not be used in place of secondary sources for detailed discussion. Although Wikipedia articles are tertiary sources, Wikipedia employs no systematic mechanism for fact checking or accuracy. Because Wikipedia forbids original research, there is nothing reliable in it that isn't citable with something else.Thus Wikipedia articles (or Wikipedia mirrors) are not reliable sources for any purpose.

I thought the above was a misread, the first time I read it. However, it supports why College Professors and teachers discourage using Wikipedia for academic research. It also means that editors, administrators and others involved with creating articles, are in fact, wasting thier time. 

The only person who can gain from Wikipedia, is the fuck-head, money beggar, Jimbo Wales. So all of you who want to edit war, keep it up, you're wasting your fucking time, for nothing. After doing a scan of the Whitman article, since the inclusion and copying of Lavergne's book and other sources, the article is only about 20% accurate. And yes, I am John Moore, who was Houston McCoy's power of attorney, who helped him until Wikipedia came between us when I tried to correct information - a long time ago, and his daughter got involved and help fuel the flames that could have been put out with a reasonable conclusion, if the above info would have been known at the time. But Whitman was my research subject, I helped McCoy because he needed it, he in turn lied to me on several occasions, but I can forgive him for that, at least he had a forgivable condition. Jimbo Wales and Wikipedia, are a sickness unto themselves.

So Pinkafuckup and YGLEE and other IP's who know nothing, have an admin ban me, PLEASE! It won't be necessary, but then, your edit wars were not necessary either. Keep on being the knee pads that Jimbo Smells wants - you deserve!!!2001:558:6007:27:7992:7DA3:D702:EE6A",0.0

Re the definition of what is obsolete, that is simple. Every concept is built based on some data. When new data have been obtained, the concept must either accommodate these data or explain why these data can be ignored. The concept that fail to do so is deemed obsolete.

However, after discovery of the red shift by Hubble it became obvious that this theory is inconsistent with these data. Now this theory is believed to be obsolete.

I don't want to go to WP:AN on this since WP:AN often is more trouble than it's worth, especially since it's minor, but User:Winklevi who was brought up at the edit warring 3RR board has been harassing me after I told him three times now not to post on my talk page, at a recent AFD he nominated, he's harassed any user who voted """"keep"""", and he really needs to learn how to accurately apply policies and guidelines since he has exhibited very little understanding of what they actually are (and hope some exist that in reality don't).

Howdy rob,

You wrote above,

I disagree with your interpretation.

Fine, the Dominion of Canada, is a free country.  The """"footnote"""" was not the basis of my arguement.   Constitutional Law does not afford the retroactive re-naming of terms within a Constitutional Act.   Each term that is repelled must be specifically indicated.  Each Clause that is replaced, must be explicitly indicated.

Your grasp of Constitution Law and procedures is complete ill-informed.  Do you have any idea the Constitutional Chaos that would be created in any present day independent country, that has used as a basis English Common-Law as a template? (i.e., the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand)

Do you?

As well, where the **** did you learn that """"Canada had no Constitution until 1982?""""

"Sons of Ali al-Hadi (Imam Ali Naqi)
There is no conclusion over three sons or seven.  Why it is considered necessary to place a full stop after mentioning three sons.  Therefore it is necessary to evaluate the reliability of reference being emphasized with the availability of an ISBN # and its publishing in English language by a foreign expert (his dignity is recognized, but critical view is our right).  In my discussion  Abu Mikhnaf is one of primary sources per norm of social science (history).

 Primary sources: relate to an event, written by someone who experienced or witnessed the event in question by  letters, memoirs, journals, speeches, manuscripts, etc.

Secondary sources: function to interpret primary sources.  Secondary sources interpret to assign value and draw conclusions about the events reported in primary sources.
 
When evaluating primary or secondary sources, the very basis warrants to know:
(i)How does the author know these details
(ii) Was the author present at the event or soon on the scene? 
(iii) Where does this information come from, i.e. personal experience, eyewitness, or reports written by others?

Thus the reliability of an scholar (Wilferd Madelung ) belonging to a belated period (20th century) depending on single source of tenth century does not sense to overrule the very old primary source of 8th century  which is not only supported by millions of naqvis/naqavis  of the world (particularly the sub-continent) but also evident from the various published (secondary) sources e.g. Gulzar-e-Naqi (Riaz ulnasab), compiled with the help of 38 books annexing 40 pedigrees, by a family member of Ali Naqi Naqvi .  The writer belongs to well educated family, his two elder brothers were college principals in colleges of  Punjab.  Among his brothers Dr. Sohail Bukhari was an authority in Urdu Literature  in his time besides being an author for Punjab Text Books for school and colleges.

In view of above discussion the section which provides explanation to the confusion in numbering and names of sons should remain in the main article for research and reference, in terms of EN-WP being  the tertiary source.",0.0

This behavior is going to be reported to Wikipedia adminstrators. Please consider helping instead of damaging or orienting. Ralhazzaa 

The maps you have presented aren't anything new Ralhazaa. I can't believe people keep having the same discussions in this talk page over and over again. and everytime the discussions reach the same conclusion, but then after a couple of weeks another person starts the same pointless round of edits. To be very brief (these have been discussed in length in different sections of the talk page and it's archives):  1. The maps you mentioned were proven to be inaccurate and were corrected in their later versions. verified through several articles and sources.  2. The UN resolution you mentioned does not pertain to """"international"""" bodies of water, but to bodies of water that are shared between two or more countries. There is a difference. For example Shat-al-Arab is a river which falls under that category. But international waters do not fall under that category and the UN geographical names committee approves the standard  international name for them.  

 To ralhazza.  First of all we have discussed all issues here.  There does not exist a single textual evidence for Arabian Gulf.  We have about 300+ maps and 8 maps you brought from different books all have maps of Persian Gulf and their newer edition have been corrected.  It is all there and you can not insert a POV without discussion.  Read it again: [].  Why aren't you bringing newer maps from the newer editions of those books and mentioning that texts calls it Persian Gulf?   

 Perfect truth is not attainable like this. Show all POVs boys!

Other users are required not to violate the using of references by saying """"It is incorrect!"""" or """"False"""" as long as it is apparently Ancient, Referential, Internationally Accepted and Used, Showing different POV(s) and Neutral.

You've made three mistakes:
 
Is the version I'd reverted to - unstable? On the contrary: the version that you were attempting to revert to - is unstable, because the chapter you'd removed, was added three years ago (on 5 May 2008), and lasted until 14 March 2011, i.e. until the day before yestreday, whereas the version you were attempting to revert to - lasted for less than 40 hours only - that were uncontinuous and broken, so which version is more stable?
Returning the chapter you'd removed - is not against the consensus at all. The chapter is supported by User:(MOB)DeadMeat, and is also supported by User:Chrishatch1973, and is also supported by User:Eliko; whereas the removal of the chapter is supported by User:Basket of Puppies only. Really, it was also supported (in the past) by User:DragonflySixtyseven, however their reason for the removal - was refuted on their talk page (and on the article talk page as well), and they didn't respond to the refutation. According to the law: Silence gives consent, the very fact that User:DragonflySixtyseven didn't respond to the refutation - shows that User:DragonflySixtyseven does not reject the explanation given on their talk page (and on the article talk page as well) for returning the chapter. To sum up, three editors (User:(MOB)DeadMeat, User:Chrishatch1973 and User:Eliko) support the chapter, and one single user (User:Basket of Puppies) rejects it, so which option is more consensual? Returning the chapter, or removing it?
The chapter you removed is relevant, as I'd explained on the article talk page - before you removed the chapter. If you think the chapter is irrelevant - despite my explanation (on the article talk page) why it's relevant, then please discuss that on the article talk page.

Note that when you responded to me on my talk page - each one of us had made one revert only - during 2011, so: considering that the single revert I've made during 2011 - was sufficient for you to warn me of your reporting me for WP:3RR and edit-warring - if I """"continue to revert"""", also your single revert you've made during 2011 - should be sufficient for me to warn you of my reporting you for WP:3RR and edit-warring - if you """"continue to revert"""".
If you continue to both - remove a consensual chapter - and replace it by an unstable version which is against the consensus, then I will report you for violating Wikipedia policy, that requires - to discuss everything on the article talk page - before removing a consensual chapter and before replacing it by an unstable version which is against the consensus.
Anyways: due to your claim about irrelevance, I will add to the (stable consensual) chapter - some clarifications, to make sure that every reader (including User:Basket of Puppies) understands its relevance.

Well, dear Ahasuerus: It is actually difficult to edit any page in Wikipedia without Muslims jumping at you and trying to censor you with all sorts of excuses. You must understand that the freedom of speech for Muslims is an alien concept. In Islamic countries if you say something against Islam they kill you. Where they can't kill you, they censor you. Wikipedia seems to be dominated by Muslims. This of course is not true in all the pages where Muslims have no interest, but when the interest of Islam comes in, they can be quite bullish in making their word prevail. But that is another story. This article started with some explanation like this:

In recent years especially after the 9/11 some observers, including Muslim dissidents have stated that Islam presents a threat bigger than Nazism not to just the Western world but to all non-Islamic countries. They have labeled those who defend Islam and try to be politically correct about it, the today’s useful idiots. 

[Ali Sina] states: “They are idiots because they speak without knowledge of Islam and its threat to mankind and they are useful to the Islamists with whose help they can penetrate the non-Muslim countries and destroy them from within.”  The same author writes: “More abhorrent than war is making peace with evil. In the words of the 18th Century British parliamentarian Edmund Burke, """"All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing."""" Those who advocate peace with Islam are idiots of this century. If we do not stand against Islam it will grow and then billions will die. Trying to appease Muslims is foolish. It is informed by ignorance of Islam. Most cancers are treatable, if detected in time. But if ignored, they will grow to a stage that will kill you. Today we have the choice. We can either fight Islam and extirpate it before it threatens our existence or wait and face the apocalypses.” 

Muslims obviously don't like Ali Sina. For some reason anything you post here from him they will delete at once. So the above passage that explained the concept was deleted. The administrator SlimVirgin despite claiming impartiality, has yet to show that in actions. I could be wrong but for reasons that I explained to her, I have still to be convinced of that claim. I found out that she is Iranian, like Ali Sina, but of course most Iranians are still Muslims. She even once tried to discredit Ali Sina saying that he is Islamophobic. Obviously she sees genuine criticism of Islam unwarranted and interprets that as Islamophobia. My judgement about her is just based on my first impression and I could be wrong. I have explained to her my concern about her impartiality already and I hope she will eventually show I had misjudged her. 

In Wikipedia there is a lot of Islamic propaganda which are not true at all, but generally critical views about Islam do not survive. Why? If Wikipedia is impartial shouldn’t we give equal space to both sides? Would we accept if e.g. scientologist or any other cultists try to take over the Wikipedia and disallow any criticism of their cult? What is happening is very disturbing. There are hundreds of pages in Wikipedia that are misleading because they are edited and controlled by Muslims and as soon as you try to post anything showing the other side of the coin they revert it and even call your contribution “hate speech”. What about the Quran? Isn’t that book a hate speech?  

Funny thing is that they throw at you the basic rules of Wikipedia when in reality it is they who constanly breach those rules. 

If you try to write anything that Muslims don’t like they will delete it with invalid justifications. This is a very disturbing trend. For example the quotes of Ali Sina were removed because, as they said, he is not notable. There are 200,000 pages talking about faith freedom international. There have been death threats in Islamic sites against him, there are a few Islamic sites created just to refute him. Doesn’t all that say that he is notable at least to be quoted? Finally if he is notable enough to have a page in Wikipedia why his quotes should not be published? 

I am not familiar with the structure of Wikipedia, but I suppose there must be some committee that would check into complaints. (All I am hoping is that this committee is not already taken over by Islamists)  Is there a forum where important questions such as the direction Wikipedia is taking is discussed? 

Sorry, this subject might have not belonged to this page but these are things I would like to discuss. Is there a place to do that?  My point is that if Wikipedia loses its impartiality and becomes the guardian angel of a certain cult or religion, it loses its credibility fast.  05:13 2",0.14285714285714285

 more NPOV issues 

This article is pretty sloppy, as I think most people can tell.  I took out the section on first cause as revised by Nodem, which went beyond just poor style and outright called one side of the debate fallacious, which isn't really appropriate in an article on a philosophical topic.

Maybe I went a bit far?  I just object to statements like, the entirety of space-time came into existence at some point, unless you define this point embedded in a larger space-time outside of our own. The fallacy comes from implying that both the statements, space-time is everything, and something exists outside of space-time, are true. However, I work in computer software and don't do physics (although this is really about philosophy), so maybe I'm just using the the wrong kind of logic?  

If time is finite, then there must be a beginning (which is what I think is meant by """"at some point"""").  I don't think the phrase """"came into existence at some point"""" necessarily implies any metaphysical cause (ie: thing/being 'outside' the universe), does it?  06:59, 22 Dec 2004 (UTC)

I wasn't really comfortable with the version that came before it, though.  First cause is a complex topic, or at least a lot has been said about it, and the previous version of the paragraph was presenting a rather severe dichotomy.  If someone could write a good article about the first cause debate, and maybe link to it from this article, that would be good.  I'm not really qualified to do it.

Also, and I haven't made an edit about this, I'm uncomfortable, as a physicist, with the statement that most astronomers hold to scientific determinism.  While many do, and they may be right, I can tell you that by far the dominant interpretation of quantum mechanics in physics circles is a nondeterministic one.  Oops!  forgot to login.  I'm misterbailey if anyone was wondering.

You are right to question the most astronomers bitI'll put in a qualifier about macroscopic forces.  I've been working on deterministic system (philosophy), where I put a bit more about quantum physics and determinism, but it is a complex subject.    

I agree that it would be nice if there were a separate article on first causes.  And I agree that this article is sort of sloppy.    Perhaps subheadings could be a first step to clearing it up?

That awkward sentence was created by the clumsy Steinsky, who added the criticism bit to a simple statement of fact that Sustrans did not meet the agreed conditions of millennium funding, eg that the network would be for 60% transport cycling.  There has been other extensive vandalism here by Steinsky, who also removed the very significant piece of information that Sustrans are not a membership organisation.  That is verifiable via the Charity Commission, but a most inconvenient fact for those who want to imply that Sustrans is in some way democratic and accountable.  There may be as few as three actual members, and they are notorious for listening to no one and steamrollering counterproductive schemes despite valid objections.

 Gneiss 

Hello, Vsmith  I just finished going through the article on Gneiss. I made a few copy-edits and moved a few sentences. (I hope you approve.) I noticed a few things that I felt I had better ask you about before changing anything:

1) I noticed there was a section called """"Types"""" that contains only two sentences, and that the first of those is a repetition of a sentence I saw earlier at the end of the section headed """"Composition"""". I don't think the sentence needs to be repeated, but I didn't know which place was best for it.

2) The section on """"Etymology"""" starts with this sentence:

The etymology of the word gneiss is disputed.

but then we read of only one theory as to the origin of the word. If the etymology is disputed, shouldn't at least one other theory be given?

3) In the second paragraph in the section Gneiss#Gneissic banding, the word """"relatively"""" appears four times. I'm wondering whether all of them are necessary.

4) Regarding the images:

(a) I think they could be arranged better than they are. The first two images after the lead image are bunched close to the top. Wouldn't it be better if they were next to the sentences that mention those types of gneiss?

(b) The first image after the lead image mentions Augen gneiss from Brazil, but nowhere in the article does it say that gneiss is found in Brazil.

(c) The third image after the lead image mentions gneiss from New York State, but nowhere in the article does it say that gneiss is found in New York State. Also, there is no mention of gneiss found in New England or any of the western states.

(d) There is a whole section called Gneiss#Lewisian gneiss, and a whole section called Gneiss#Archean and Proterozoic gneiss, but there is no image of Lewisian, archean, or proterozoic gneiss. 

I don't mind searching for images, but I don't know where to look and would need advice on uploading and licenses. -   """,0.0

A column in the Birmingham News (Alabama) elicited memories from people who remembered Bush when he was there: """"None have specific recollections about Bush and the National Guard.

Opinions of him during this time ranged from bad (bragging about drinking and allegations he trashed a cottage where he was living) to good (amiable, well liked, and fond of sports). One coworker on the Blount campaign staff, Archibald Blount, a relative of Blount, claimed that Bush was known during this time as the """"Texas Souffle"""", for his supposed character of looking good on the outside but not having much on the inside.

 Tornadoes form when the land is slightly damp and there is high winds. When there is a bad storm in the mountains you will often hear about Tornado Warnings. Not every storm turns into a tornado/twister.

 Please stop. If you continue to vandalise Wikipedia, you will be blocked.  

You are using a biased and POV sources - they admit to it themselvesWikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view, you yourself are biased and POV (per your Political claims on your personal page), your source is uncorroborated (not a valid source), you continually edited without discussion or made non-sensical comments after the vandalism, this claim does not belong on a city page that is not related to the subject matter and others have agreed to that fact, you did it for the purposes of advertising the Armenian Political agenda that you clearly admit adhering to on your personal WP page(soapbox), and your source itself does not, again it DOES NOT - say anything about specifially """"genocide in Ordu"""" - which is without a doubt pure Vandalism as you are twisting the """"source"""" that you supplied yourself. You even misquoted from the original. This not even sneaky vandalism - it's blatant, purposeful, organized, and relentless.

To reitirate my point on Ordu:talk, your sources are not NPOV. Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view I never argued with you about their Academic credentials even though the specific claims made by them are uncorroborated by any other Academic dead or alive. Dardian, the originator of your claim himself has not ever explicity said """"there was genocide in Ordu"""". You are interpreting - which is your POV on top of his POV!! Dardian is now the director of a Armenian Genocide Research organization. You can not honestly expect anyone to believe you that are they are NOPV sources and that you are doing this to improve that quality of WP.

"In general, the reusable parts of fuel are long-lived and the parts that complicate reuse of spent fuel are short-lived.  In general, fuel becomes easier to reprocess over time, largely because less shielding is needed to protect against radiation from the decay of short-lived fission products.  One exception is the decay of Pu-241 (with a half-life of 14 years) to Am-241 (half-life 432 years).  Though the decay rate is much lower, the radiation hazard is higher because the decay includes a low-energy gamma ray.  Recycled fuel with higher Am-241 is therefore somewhat harder to handle safely.  Also, the Am-241 is not fissile and is therefore prone to absorb neutrons (in a standard light-water reactor) and produce higher transuranics rather than fission and produce energy and fission products, so the spent fuel is also harder to handle.

Fast reactors in principle can help reduce these problems, since most transuranics undergo fission in a fast neutron spectrum.  But fast reactors do not have a strong track record of reliability and carry a significant cost premium.  So in considering the economics of recycling, it's important to take into account not only the cost premium of the fuel but also the cost premium of the reactor needed to use the recycled fuel most effectively.",0.0

Hurricane Expert Reconsiders Global Warming Link

Prominent MIT hurricane scientist Kerry Emanuel has publicly reversed his view regarding global warming's alleged impact on hurricanes.

“The [computer] models are telling us something quite different from what nature seems to be telling us,"""" said Emanuel, whose views on hurricanes and global warming have been prominently cited by Al Gore and other promoters of climate change fear.

He told the New York Times. """"There are various interpretations possible: The big increase in hurricane power over the past 30 years or so may not have much to do with global warming, or the models are simply not faithfully reproducing what nature is doing. Hard to know which to believe yet.”

In 2005, a few weeks before Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, Emmanuel asserted in a paper that he had found statistical evidence linking rising hurricane energy and global warming.

His conversion is a very important new development in the climate debate, said Marc Morano, a top aide to climate change skeptic Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla.

""""First, 2007 turned out to be the ‘tipping point’ for global warming fears, and 2008 appears to be the year of vindication for skeptics as many prominent scientists reverse their climate views, more and more skeptical scientists speak out, and new data debunks man-made climate fears.

“Now another major scientist reconsiders his views on a significant aspect of man-made climate fears.”

"""== Perceptions of cuteness ==

I am ambivalent about the old meme reference in this section that the below poster complains about.  However, I do have a real criticism:

The line """"here are good evolutionary reasons to expect humans to find juvenile humans, and perhaps juvenile animals in general, cute."""" should definitly either expound on the alluded-to """"good reasons"""", or at the least link to somewhere in wikipedia where these reasons are enumerated and explained.

-B. McGrauw (not logged in)

I think the whole perceptions of cuteness section should be removed to improve the focus of the article. What things people find cute and possible reasons for that is an interesting question, but it is an anthropological question and serves only to muddle this article.

In any case, the """"Every time you masturbate..."""" joke should be removed. It was popular among internet humorists for a while, but not really worthy of note outside of its own article; also, it is an off color joke and goes completely against the tone of the rest of the article.

Any thoughts?
 
Hey.. i was looking for imformation on how to take care of abandoned kittens and came acrossed the discussion board.. i cant believe like a page was devoted to whether or not an article should linked on the page.. who really cares... i hope yas rnt losing sleep over it...(n)... i dunt mean to sound like a biotch... but its boring to read about all the complaints... and the point of the board is to write about cats/kittens.. atleast thats what the impression i got .. could b wrong though (anon)

The reference to the """"Every time you masturbate..."""" joke should be removed. It does nothing to enhance the article. And every time some kid looks up kitten on wikipedia, a parent has to answer questions about masturbation. It's offensive, if nothing else.  

In response to the first anon, this page is actually for discussion on how the article can be improved. Some off-topic comments are usually tolerated but long discussion threads are generally seen as disruptive.
In response to Wabazana, Wikipedia is not censored for the protection of minors. However, I do agree that this particular reference is a bit of a systemic bias towards nerdy references. I've boldly changed it to refer to Hello Kitty (which was already in 'see also'), which I think we can agree is going to be more familiar to the average reader.  

Lovely though it is, is """"perceptions of cuteness"""" really encyclopaedic?   
Well, it's interesting. It's written in a neutral point of view. And as regards verifiability, if 'kittens are cute' isn't common knowledge, then I don't know what is. So yes, I for one think it's encyclopaedic.  ( T | C | A ) 

I read about the '""""perceptions of cuteness"""" discussion on the wiki kitten page in the Wall Street Journal, Wed. August 15th edition, and was thrilled. The cuteness of kittens/cats is one of my favorite subjects, to the annoyance of everyone who knows me. I do agree with another poster's comment that the pics of the kittens on this page aren't necessarily the best. Feel free to use this picture of my kitten PJ.  http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Pj_blinds.jpg

 Lead is too narrow 
The lead states """"Adherents of the 9/11 Truth Movement deny that al-Qaeda terrorists hijacked four airliners and intentionally crashed two into the World Trade Center buildings"""". I think this is too specific, as not all proponents argue this. Some (engineers particularly) only claim that the towers were brought down with the help of explosives without any assumptions as to who was involved. The use of explosives doesn't preclude Al-Qaeda (or anyone else) from hijacking (or otherwise) airliners (or aircraft of similar description) from intentionally crashing into the WTC. It seems fairly obvious that aircraft flew into the buildings, but that also doesn't preclude the use of explosives. I'm not a die hard truther, but I don't belive the mainstream media or the US government either. As a structural engineer there does seem to be some quirks in the hypothesis put forward by NIST, and the apparent hasty destruction of material evidence from the disaster does seem very questionable. Calling for further investigation doesn't seem unreasonable regardless of what actually happened. There seems to be a lot of people who get offended even by the mere suggestion of further investigation (which may in fact help to clear the government of any involvement). I guess these people (who seem to get all their 'facts' from Fox and CNN) explain why the US government is able to get away with gradual erosion of liberties (PATRIOT, NDAA, TSA, etc).

 I know as I have not been able to find out how many amps the receiver and transmitter drew is what happened on the flight to Hawaii. We know about when the generator went off line and we know when they landed. The rest is deduction. What I cannot tell you is if they were down on an island on their belly, (see Lambrechts opinion of landing chances on Gardener) how long they could operate their radios. Or if their electrical system would have been intact enough to function. I grew up in the age of the vacuum tube and know that it would take a minute or two - to 'warm' up the dynamotor and transmitter to the point where it would achieve full power. This is all assuming they had no serious damage to the airplane. My 'best guess"""" (OPINION, don't ask me to put it in the article) is that they probably had at least one hour of operation. The other question is how much """"gain"""" they would have gotten from a """"less than optimum"""" (to quote the TIGHAR radio guy) length under 1/8 wave, V-type antenna sitting less than six feet off the ground. The answer is probably - but not definitely - not much. We are looking at an actual output from the antenna of perhaps 10-20 watts with a horizontal polarity and bad angle. Perhaps they were heard. Odds are they were not. (I repeat this is OPINION). Still we need to consider these things. My guess is that Earhart (OPINION) could have transmitted and received for at least 1 hour. That she could have done one or the other longer. One must remember that a dynamotor was a pretty inefficient means of turning low DC voltage into high voltage AC for radio communications, thus the receiver alone would have more operational life than the transmitter (once again, we do not know how many minutes the xmitter or receiver were on during the Hawaii flight, but a good guess is that they both ran all the time). That the propagation characteristics of her antenna and the frequencies she was able to operate on severely limited any possible range. I find it far easier to think that reports of a 'weak carrier"""" or 'feeble and unintelligible"""" communications being hear are far more likely than someone who claimed to hear her 4/5.

The bottom line - in my humble (and we all know how humble I am) - opinion is that given the best of circumstances, they would have had at least one hour of radio time left if they were out of fuel. """,0.0

This personage, it is stated, had two sons, Muirich Mhor and Dhai Dhu. From the former of these was descended Clan Mhuirich or Macpherson, and from the latter Clan Dhai or Davidson.

DELETION OR THEN MERGER 

There must be verifiable, objective evidence that the subject has received significant attention from independent sources to support a claim of notability NRV.

WP:NOPAGE -notability is a very serious question here and the weak and non-scholarly material does not amount to a stand alone article. The article is a combination of some  critic/red flagging of the  criticism of the Frankfurt School theories labelled here as """"Conspiracy Theory"""". Yes it can entertained that some  claims & rumours are discussed on minor internet sites that amount to """"Conspiracy talk"""", but it is no reason for a Wikipedia entry or let alone a stand alone Wikipedia article.

 REASONS FOR DELETION ARE NUMEROUS AND VERY CONCRETE
WP:NPOV neutral point of view! 

WP:OR -The term """"original research"""" (OR) is used on Wikipedia to refer to material—such as facts, allegations, and ideas—for which no reliable, published sources exist

WP:V - means that people reading and editing the encyclopedia can check that the information comes from a reliable source. Where available, academic and peer-reviewed publications are usually the most reliable sources, such as in history, medicine, and science.

WP:FRINGE -A theory that is not broadly supported by scholarship in its field must not be given undue weight in an article

WP:NOTOPINION -Opinion pieces, although some topics, particularly those concerning current affairs and politics, may stir passions and tempt people to """"climb soapboxes"""". 

WP:YESPOV -Avoid stating opinions as facts

WP:WEIGHT -Neutrality requires that each article or other page in the mainspace fairly represents all significant viewpoints that have been published by reliable sources, in proportion to the prominence of each viewpoint in the published, reliable sources. For example, discussion of isolated events, criticisms, or news reports about a subject may be verifiable and impartial, but still disproportionate to their overall significance to the article topic. This is a concern especially in relation to recent events that may be in the news.

 Allegations of anti-semitism 
I propose that the anti-semitism allegations be subsumed into a section on Diversity in order to conform with WP:UNDUE. The section should talk about the school demographic profile. It is ridiculous to libel the school on the grounds of two faculty members. We don't even know if they weren't fired for incompetence. In fact, it seems we don't even presently have reliable sources that there were only two Israeli faculty members and when they were employed. Were these Israelis also Jewish? Does the newspaper article discuss this? (t, c) 

 has raised concerns about the reputability of the supporting article's editor, Gill Fraser. This is a good place to discuss this. Please come forward with your sources in support or opposition of this allegation. Same goes for the writer, Dan Fraser. (t, c) 

Given that the only source for the allegations right now is a forum content, I don't think there are any reliable sources supporting the allegation. In the absence of sources, the section should be removed. —' (talk) 

Agree forums of this nature are not reliable sources, and content lacking a reliable source should be removed.   

Adoniscik I am the right source to provide this information because I am talking from experience.  I had first written an angry letter to Cyprus Today in order to complain about some of our professors resigning due to the economic problems in 2005. It was published along with two responses which completely overwhelmed me with such claims that TRNC diplomas are 'worthless pieces of paper' and one other going so far as to say that EMU is a 'zoo'. I then wrote a second letter to defend the university because I felt my intentions were taken advantage of. I wanted to complain not trash the university. The following summer I had some work expierence which was not too bad but I still felt a bit uncomfortable about this newspapers stand to North Cyprus higher education. I did an interview with the Rector at the time Prof. Dr. Halil Guven which was not published. The next summer I translated positive artices from the Press office at EMU for 2-3 months and again they were not published. To be honest I have not been following what they have been writing since then, but as soon as I read that this article was written at Cyprus Today I am now certain that this newspaper has a negative stand point on TRNC higher education therefore, I do not think they are a reliable source on these matters. They cannot present the story in an objective manner.
As for the Israeli employees at EMU I can only provide again from first ahnd experience as one of his students that it was not anything to do with his nationality but honestly I don't think we were getting anything out of his classes. He just was not doing his job and at times making strange comments in his classes that were irritating students to the point that they would complain and sign a petition.   —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

As a party to the conflict, that is a sign that you are not the right source to provide information from the article. First-hand accounts are not appropriate for Wikipedia. —' (talk) 

C.Fred I will only accept that and not edit the aricle again if this issue is properly researched with the concerned parties in the conflict all present their story icluding myself. An objective party should listen to all sides of the story and then write an article which I will respect and it can then be submitted as wikipedia information. However, I do want to mention that I have read many university profiles on wikipedia and none provide this kind of information about conflicts they have within the university. A bit strange that someone wants it to be submitted here as well. EMU must have many enemies.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)

Number one, it's more correct cronologically, and number two, do we really need to split up the outfield positions on an infobox? I could understand putting """"Left fielder"""" for someone like Barry Bonds or Ted Williams or someone else who spent his entire career at one outfield position, but when he's played more than one outfield position, splitting it up like that is a little bit too much information and just makes the infobox look cumbersome.

 Freedom House comment in introduction 

I deleted a paragraph in the opening of the article; this was promptly re-inserted by another user.  The text is: """"Israel is a democratic republic with universal suffrage that operates under the parliamentary system. According to the international data reported by Freedom House, the degree of political rights and civil liberties in Israel makes it the only liberal democracy in the Middle East, consisting of a multi-party system and separation of powers"""" 

I believe I had good reasons for removing it:

(1) The very same text - verbatim - is repeated later in the article.  This is reason enough for deleting it from the opening.  Without citing chapter and verse of Wikipedia policies, obviously a well-written article cannot be repetitious.

(2) A conclusionary statement about civil liberties is ipso facto a value-judgment.    This is obviously going to be endlessly controversial whatever the country involved (see point (3) below).  It is churlish to place this kind of comment right up there in the introduction.  Common/significant views about political rights are much better dealt with (less tersely) under the Government heading. I myself do not seek to contest the view that Israel has a high degree of political freedom, so if you disagree with me, deal with the point I make about the reasonableness of reporting this sort of evaluation in the opening of *any* country article.

(3) Where the very same text appears in the Government section, it is immediately followed by a contrary viewpoint, which the author(s) of this section thought was equally significant: """"Conversely, the research group Minorities at Risk (MAR) characterizes Israel's system ...""""  This gives a nice indication of how controversial the Freedom House opinion is, or at least appears to be to other Wikipedians.  Indeed, I'd like to ask: does the person who reverted my deletion of the same text from the opening think that its stupid to allign the Freedom House statement with opposing viewpoints (maybe because the Freedom House statement is 'incontrovertible', or whatever), and if so why did he/she not remove the 'Minorities at Risk' comment from the Government section?

(4) The text is a quote from Freedom House, which is widely regarded as a US-lead, organisation operating to promote a particular policy programme.  The Times (hardly a fringe opinion) has described it as an """"outpost of American soft power"""": .  Unlike, say, the Human Development Index there is hardly any global consensus support for its reports.  Giving its views such decisive prominence - treating them as the bottom-line on the country's political status by placing them in the opening - seems unencyclopaedic.  

I suggest that unless consensus forms against me on this, I should remove the offending text from the introduction.  There's presumably no objection to the same text being under the Government section (as it currently is - as well).

Response Thank you for your concern. However, from where I sit, it isn't my """"good faith"""" that is at issue here. It's the good faith of the AfD initiator and his fellow instigators that is at issue. After all, I didn't write the CTMU article. Tim Smith did, and I don't know Mr. Smith from Adam. 

Suffice it to say that I consider myself to be somewhat knowledgable regarding the topic of that article, and rather than let Wikipedia readers be deceived, disinformed, and otherwise steered wrong about it, feel a responsibility to edit any part of it which I know to be erroneous or malicious in nature. All of my edits to date have satisfied this criterion. 

In addition, you should know that even if I wanted to introduce myself to you - and as it happens, I feel no such desire - I certainly wouldn't do so in any way that might advantage people whom I consider to be hostile, untrustworthy, or despicable, no matter how hard and hypocritically they try to blend into the Wikipedia community. Needless to say, that includes some of those involved in this AfD.

 bail out or bale out? 
For """"escape by parachute"""", my copy of Chambers Dictionary authorizes both spellings equally. I am British. I am more familiar with the spelling """"bale out"""". Perhaps this is yet another case where usual UK and USA spellings differ.  
First, """"bailing water"""" is never spelt baling water and I doubt you'd find that in Chambers.
For the parachute bailing, we use British English almost exclusively for the most part in Australia too, yet I've never once seen this use of bale (as in """"bale out of an aircraft"""") although it is evidently an alternate spelling of bail. But since """"bail out of an aircraft"""" is the way it's spelt at least 50% of the time in Britain and close to 100% of the time elsewhere (according to this WorldWideWords article), don't you think this information should go at the Bail disambig page on Wikipedia  and there is already a link to this from Bale.

http://defensedistributed.com/products/ specifically talks about manufacturing an AR-15.
Whether they are commercial / advocacy / non-profit seems irrelevant. If they publish information relevant to wiki topic then can it not be used a reference?..
If a third party article described a method of milling the lower receiver of an AR-15 at home then it too could be referenced.

The Wikipedia page lists the manufacturers and then goes on to detail, at length, the global legislation controlling the distribution of the AR-15.

"Welcome!

Welcome to Wikipedia, !  My name is Ryan, aka . I noticed that you were new and haven't received any messages yet. I just wanted to see how you were doing. Wikipedia can be a little intimidating at first, since it uses different formatting than other sites that use HTML and CSS. In the long run, though, you'll find that the WikiSyntax is a lot easier and faster than those other ways. Here are a few links to get you started:

How to edit a page
Editing, policy, conduct, and structure tutorial
Picture tutorial
How to write a great article

There are a lot of policies and guides to read, but I highly recommend reading over those first. If you have any questions, feel free to leave me a message on my talk page. Please be sure to sign your name on Talk using four tildes (~~~~) to produce your name and the current date, along with a link to your user page. This way, others know when you left a message and how to find you. It's easier than having to type out your name, right? )

OMG, you are an imbecile.  Seriously.  

Let's go over this one last time on the remote chance you might finally understand the difference between fact and opinion.

I rewrote the contribution using ONLY information that I found on the Internet that supported the contribution.  I did not add anything to the story that could not be verified through a reliable source.  YOU, on the other hand, wrote a contribution that DID add content to the story that could NOT be verified through a reliable source, making it YOUR OPINION.  You said things like  """"... when a neighboring police agency was needed and requested by the chief of police to intervene in the criminal conduct of Arvada's police force.""""

This is libelous, because you accuse the Arvada Police Department of """"criminal conduct"""" when no criminal conduct has been proven in a court of law.  Even the officer who is alleged to have done the hitting has been found """"not guilty"""" by your peers. Because no one is convicted in the link you provide (or ANY link ANYWHERE on the Internet), it is your OPINION.  If you had used the phrase """"ALLEGED criminal conduct"""" you would be more on track.

You also wrote: """"Arvada's city council had chosen not to intervene in the previous criminal conduct of several members of the Arvada police, despite a cost to the city of close to half a million dollars defending the criminal actions of one police officer alone, during a period of budget crises.""""

The """"close to half a million dollars"""" was NOT spent """"defending the criminal actions of one police officer alone.""""  The money was spent settling OUT OF COURT so that the accusations had no opportunity to be proven as fact.  A """"criminal"""" is someone who has been CONVICTED of a crime. So there cannot be """"criminal actions"""" unless someone has been convicted of a crime.  There CAN be """"alleged questionable actions,"""" which is what you should have written. 

When you post hateful things about others that is just your opinion, that opens you up to a LIBEL SUIT.  If you do it in a blog, and you make it clear that you are expressing your opinion and not facts, you can say whatever you like there without much fear of libel.  But when you post to a site whose premise is encyclopedic content, you cannot just post what you THINK.  You must post what can be VERIFIED.   Do you understand this very basic principle?  Please read it again if you don't, because I'm done trying to educate you.

Definition of libel (I encourage you to visit the link and read all its contents):  http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-libel.htm

Libel involves false statements knowingly presented as fact. In the United States opinion is protected as a tenant of freedom of speech, falling outside the purview of libel. Citizens retain the right to comment on public figures and entities, including government and officials. Entertainment, parody, editorials and criticisms that may arguably misrepresent facts are not libelous so long as they are presented for amusement or stated as mere opinion. 

From:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation

How to prove libel:  There are several ways a person must go about proving that libel has taken place. For example, in the United States, the person first must prove that the statement was false. Second, that person must prove that the statement caused harm. And, third, they must prove that the statement was made without adequate research into the truthfulness of the statement. These steps are for an ordinary citizen.

 Silesians 

Andrew, I have not made any comments out of a desire to provoke you. I have been editing this article out of a desire to ensure it meets the standards and conventions of the English Wikipedia. I am sorry you had a negative experience with the German Wikipedia, but that is a separate project from this English project. Assuming good faith is a fundamental principle of the English Wikipedia; I advise you to give editors a chance instead of assuming the worst. I inquired about Silesian/Polish because Silesians are sometimes considered a separate ethnic group. I am not sure what you mean by """"reverting the article upside down""""; my editing has been done to ensure that its formatting and style is consistent with other biographical articles. As I do not anticipate being able to copy-edit the article further, I am removing it from my watchlist. Good luck with the article. Olessi  

Thanks for you comments, and in fact fruitful discussion. You are right that the work of a person is most important.
However, there are much present and past propaganda, which destroy the peace. If only some people would show objectivity and patience, as you did, it could be clear up. To mention nationality is however important, since exceptional individuals inspire new generation of a nation. (Unfortunately, nations or ethnic groups will still exist. I have to hope for peaceful coexistence of them, and fair competition. Seems to me that competition has to exit too – best if for fun only.)
I am conscious that English and German Wikipedias are separate projects, but you see, when I approach German Wiki, Dzierzon article the Polish relevant article was attacked by some German/Silesian/Polish guy. It cost me more then here on En Wiki to settle the Pl article well. So sorry if you did feel bad about my attitude, possibly I explained more my excitement.

With Silesian is in short like this: Originally, they were Slavic tribe, spoke Polish, as I mentioned. For some 300 to 500 hundred years there were under German governments. They had bad time as you possibly can imagine. Many of them married with German and were/are of course confused who they are. You know, the pressure on east of resilient nation and of course Polish-German conflicts continued. Finally in 1945 Poland returned and become new problem for some of the natives. Even those who honestly considered himself Polish Silesians at the end of war could be persecuted. There in Poland was complete disorder. Soviets and Communists arrived, most of them real simpletons any way. “National” government - just pro-soviet mafia, was mostly occupied with fight against democratic opposition. Polish borders were shifted. We lost some 20% of our area and millions of people from east territories moved to present west Poland. You can imagine that most of them were not intellectuals at all, some of them completely simple people. They spoke different Polish dialect also. On top of this in the post war, pro-soviet atmosphere criminals found good playground. Well, I do not know if you are familiar with criminal minds – unfortunately I am. This is like gangrene on fresh wound, literally. Thus many of the native Silesian could be robber in Poland, which they wanted so much. I believe that in such conditions many simpletons could use the opportunity accusing natives to be Germans.

Now, the present time, some of the falsely accused people remember the tragic experiences and want rehabilitation and apology – they could be absolutely right. However, there are many Germans who want their property back and some just using opportunity to stir in internal Polish affairs - despite the final border agreement between Poland and Germany signed on 14 November 1990 and governments effort to improve relations.
Finaly I have to say, I beleave that Polish are hospitable and very often naïve. Not many realize that politic need caution. Those who realize that have a hard time to wake up the naïves. Some procentage remember lectures of history, and objectively, too many Germans are toublemakers. I am also convinced there exists something like national character. You can have obviously you own opinion, let me have my own.
Returning to Silesians it is something close to squaring the circle . I wish the true Silesian all the best but I do not want Fith Column  on Polish terytory in addition.

Sorry if I used posibly ofencive """"reverting the article upside down"""" that was in the heat of the battle, wich I still have with Ge Wiki. They just arogantly do not answer if they do not like and refuse mediatior at any imaginative pretext. That sucks.

Sorry and thanks again. Feel free to contact me any time you need.

Over the past day, someone has made extensive revisions to this article: here is the diff. There appears to be some excellent work in it, which is the very best reason to assume good faith, but I have had to revert it, and want to explain why here. First of all, I hope the anonymous editor who wrote the other version reads this; if you do, may I encourage you to create an account, which will enable easier communication, and may help me and other editors guide you in learning how best to use Wikipedia. 

The most pressing reason to revert the changes is because the substituted version contains no inline references, but only a list of books and papers at the end. As I don't have access to these, I can't (even if I had the time) go through them and add page references to each sentence or paragraph. Also, although this is more easily rectified, the substituted version contains not a single wikilink, which makes it difficult for the reader to get a sense of context. Wikipedia is built on internal linking. 

It is also built on collaboration between editors. The substituted version was, as far as I can see, a complete rewrite, taking no account of the previous work done.

Critics argue that the xbox one kinect sensor will be able to scan your room including your heartbeat 24 hours of the day. Due to the requirement of updates every 24 hours, most active gamers won't disconnnect their kinect due to the hassle of manually updating if the xbox one is not connected to the internet for several days. The xbox one can scan through clothes to gain information about your muscle tension and reflexes regardless of a bulky sweater you might be wearing, just like airport security scanners.  The kinect sensor knows when you are smiling, crying, angry, or bored. Every detail of your face is recorded to gain an insight into your likely mood.

 Replaceable fair use Image:Hidexjapan.jpg 

Thanks for uploading Image:Hidexjapan.jpg. I noticed the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under fair use, but its use in Wikipedia articles fails our first fair use criterion in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed image could reasonably be found or created that provides substantially the same information. If you believe this image is not replaceable, please:

 Go to the image description page and edit it to add , without deleting the original Replaceable fair use template.
 On the image discussion page, write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all.

Alternatively, you can also choose to replace the fair use image by finding a freely licensed image of its subject, requesting that the copyright holder release this (or a similar) image under a free license, or by taking a picture of it yourself.

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified how these images fully satisfy our fair use criteria.

1) """"It is simply a fact that many critics of Sarfatti are very negative about his theories and speculations.""""

False. You have not given even ONE valid example of that. I doubt you would be able to understand what the physics is about anyway.
You cannot produce even ONE objective valid refutation of any of my physics ideas by anyone. CH saying """"it's nonsense"""" is not objective. It's not valid. It is not rationally argued. No reasons are given. Also I retracted my FTL Communication Idea 15 years ago. Furthermore, making a mistake in physics does not make one into a crackpot! Also, you have suppressed the fact that I predicted the SUPERSOLID decades before it was discovered and before Tony Leggett, who gets the credit published his paper. George Chapline and David Finkelstein confirm that in writing and you have consistently deleted that important factual information from the article. That is hardly fair is it?

2) """"It is also a fact that Usenet is not the usual venue for publishing even highly unconventional ideas in physics.""""

Sez who? That is exactly what Usenet SHOULD be for! INSTANT WORLD WIDE COMMUNICATION OF IMPORTANT IDEAS NOT THE CRAP THAT MOST IDIOTS PUT ON IT. Peer review is a joke in physics today. Everyone in the field knows it. The free market place of ideas is supposed to be the Wiki idea, or am I wrong? Mainstream journals DO NOT PUBLISH UNCONVENTIONAL IDEAS! What planet are you on?

3) Sarfatti has been considered negatively by many since his involvment with paraphysics dating back to ths 1970s, long before the existince of Usenet, for which I have proveided reputable sources (and can provide more). 

STOP RIGHT THERE! You just committed a HATE CRIME! Are you ABOVE THE LAW? So working on paranormal stuff automatically makes one a crackpot? Is that your position? That's like saying it's OK to lynch niggers because they are less than human. Same idea. Think about it. Sarfatti thinking outside the box means he is not entitled to the same respect as someone taking the safe boring path through life. Who are your reputable sources? Show them. Martin Gardner? Show where his exact text justifies your false extrapolation. Also, I do not in 2005 hold to the same ideas I did in 1975! Why focus on 1975 and exclude 2005? 

4) It is also a fact that were it not for his provocative statements and the largely negative reaction to them, Sarfatti would not be in any way notable.

False. I would be notable for several ideas in physics. The quotations by David Finkelstein, Lenny Susskind, George Chapline and Tony Smith prove that. It's OK to say """"negative reaction"""", but it's not OK to LYNCH ME and DEFAME ME with putting """"crank"""" and """"crackpot"""" on a very scant article in such a way that that is the KEY MESSAGE the casual reader will go away from. Now ANY LAWYER will tell you you are treading on shaky ground if you do that and cannot prove your case should it ever go to court. This is NOT a threat. I am on several TV shows and I am in Paramount Pictures Star Trek. That does not make me notable. I am cited in several popular books. That also makes me notable. For example, Herbert Gold's book Bohemia, not to mention The Dancing Wu Li Master that I ghost wrote most of  for Gary Zukavand that sold a jillion copies and is still selling after 25 years. My original Space-Time and Beyond sold fairly well also. So look David E. Siegel from Two Independence Way Suite 100, Princeton NJ 08540, your research on me is pure shlock. It's fragmentary and it gives a completely distorted image of who I really am and what I really think and WHY I AM NOTABLE!

5)"""" Now, none of that means that his critics are correct. It is true that many well-known people are strogly attacked, and it is also true that many eventually widely acccepted scientific ideas are considered absurd and crankish early in their history.  (Continental drift comes to mind and there are many other examples.) It is possible (although I belive unlikely) that Sarfatti's ideas will be similarly respected in the future. (Of course that fact that many respected theories were once thought crankish does not alter the fact that most ideas thought crankish are always so regarded  the crank thory that proves correct is a rare beast.)""""

OK, THAT'S ENOUGH you SOB! I have several MAINSTREAM PAPERS of importance that are recognized. Details were systematically vandalized from the article. Prediction of the SUPERSOLID is a KEY ONE. That ALONE makes me NOTABLE as a physicist. You DEFAME ME here and you maliciously SUPPRESS the facts. You owe me a BIG PUBLIC APOLOGY! So what you SYSOP geeks are above the law here?

This page needs to be edited down to a handful of sentences and then merged with Nose, if not altogether deleted, due to the fact that it is merely a slang term with denotions of eugenics and discredited pseudosciences such as phrenology.  The author(s) included a long paragraph by a discredited 19th century scientist named Samual George Morton, of which only five words (""""the nose large and aquiline"""") pertain to the article itself. As Wikipedia's own article on Morton says, and as most medical/science students are taught, Samuel George Morton is often thought of as the originator of """"American School"""" ethnography, a school of thought in antebellum American science that claimed the difference between humans was one of species rather than variety and is generally seen as the origin of scientific racism.
The paragraphs in this article are drawn out to unnecessary lengths so as to provide the appearance of substance; particularly the Buddhism one, which uses 53 words to say that statues of Buddha should have long noses. No reference is given.
So-called hooknose snakes have upturned """"noses,"""" not downturned """"noses"""" as raptors do, thus meaning they don't even have hooknoses as the author of this article describes, thus making their inclusion truly puzzling.  I use quotation marks because neither snakes nor birds even have noses in the sense of the ones humans/primates have. Snakes """"smell"""" by using their tongues and the Vomeronasal organ inside their mouths; a snake's """"nostril"""" holes are used only for breathing. Some venomous types use their additional larger """"nostrils"""" (actually glands called pits) to sense heat, not odors.
The fact that such noteworthy intellectuals as Ashlee Simpson and Paris Hilton have recently had rhinoplasties does not even mean that they had, or have, so-called """"hooknoses."""" Nor does the fact that a fictitious half-man/half-ungulate creature living under a bridge in Kentucky supposedly has one, though Wiki's article on it makes no mention of a hooknose, nor has it of course ever been photographed. It bears pointing out that factors allowing the genetic merging of ungulate and human DNA apparently intrigue the pseudoscience-oriented author(s) of this hooknose article. 
Overall, no tangible factors make the term """"hooknose"""" worthy of its own entry in a fact-based 21st century encyclopedia, other than as a disambiguation page redirecting to an entry such as Pseudoscience.  This is a textbook example of an unneccessary article manufactured out of several disparate and unrelated sources by using a smoke and mirrors technique.  Why not just merge it into Nose and let real scientists/doctors hash it out, rather than secluding it in its own peripheral entry based on pop culture/hearsay/non-science?  Hooknoses are an """"I know it when I see it"""" type of thing, with no set way of being measured.  If it were quantifiable by a certain mathematical formula, then it would possibly qualify for inclusion here.  (For example, if a nose is downturned by an angle of precicely x degrees or more in relation to its main slope.)  But no such formula exists.  It is a purely arbitrary, colloquial term, with a different definition to everyone.  For example, everyone has a different definition of """"fat,"""" but there is a medical definition of obesity, calculated using a Body mass index formula.   There is no such formula for noses.  Additionally, the link given to www.newadvent.org/cathen/12620b.htm does not count as a reliable source, as it is a religious, non-scientific organization making dubious and unreferenced claims.  For the record, I am white, agnostic, and have a small to medium nose with no """"hook.""""

Well, after WW2 they had already struck a deal to return Japanese colonies back to either RO-China or 
Korea with the exception of Okinawa (which btw was itself influenced by different groups)
Actually ethnicity and culture are not good arguments considering the 70% of Taiwanese are Hoklos and 15% Hakka, both classified as a branch of Southern Han, while the rest is 12% various mainlanders and 3% mixed/Aborigines. Culturally, they're a typical East Asian nation.
The reason why they're separate is because they were founded by the refugees of the ROC, making them a separate nation.

I don't think you're looking at enough season recaps for other QBs to really compare what the alternative would be. Based on what you're saying, you would deem those pages as being long sprawling lists of stats as well. I gave the articles some style by adding some structure to it. This way if you could go back and do it for past seasons, everything would be consistent. Right now, the old seasons are largely unsourced and the writing is too bulky at times. Just get the short description of what happened and everything's fine, concise and to the point.",0.0

Here are the facts: Charles Chandler was in Brazil to help train the DOI-CODI and DOPS torturers. For this reason he was gunned down by the VPR militant group in 1968. Rousseff was never a member of the VPR. At that time - 1968 - she was a member of another organization called COLINA. She would later join VAR Palmares in 1969.

Quote; """"I understand that many Irish don't like the term British Isles.""""'. Not totally true, the term is rarely used in Ireland, most Irish people don't care what people in Britain want to call the group, and would consider the term outdated in a modern forward democratic world, and thus avoid its usage. The term is occasionally used throughout the world, its usage is the exception, rather than the rule. I think the problem with the term is that it started out in life as a political term, of Great Britain claiming ownership of all the islands in the group, and to many people that original meaning still stands.

Leaving out Nelson Mandela and Mother Teresa for a moment, do you mean that you doubt he received recognitions such as this? You seem to be making the point that because you cannot find these recognitions in the press that they are somehow forgeries or myths? Hey, they ain't the Nobel Peace Prize but they are not fake. You seem to be mixing up three issues; 1) whether Hubbard led an extraordinary life and 2) whether he received extraordinary recognition as a humanitarian and 3) how Scientologists generally regard Hubbard. Those issues are not related. I think that even critics will agree that Hubbard led an extraordinary life. And neither 1) nor 2) are really related to his """"personality"""" either. I mean, was/is Mandela a bad husband? Did/does he have a temper? Who knows, you certainly won't find out in our article on him. But if someone decided to write a smear piece on him I am sure that they can find as many people that will say something bad about his """"personality"""" as we see in our Hubbard pieces. Re 3) This is not about my having some """"faith"""" or other, this is about how I have view Hubbard after intimate experience with his creations, Dianetics and Scientology and reading, IDK, millions of his words, and listening to hundreds of hours of lectures. I think that entitles me to have an opinion without getting all mystical and talking """"faith"""". I am sorry that you are getting frustrated but the simple point is that so long as the """"truth"""" about Hubbard as I see it (which, incidentally, factors in the criticisms) does not seem to be in the press then I will feel that what is there is undoubtedly one-sided. You want me to somehow persuade how that what I have come to feel based on a LOT of experience (and extensive research into the criticisms) is """"truer"""" than what some journalist wrote after talking to some few critics?

If I'm going to be indef blocked then User:Smsarmad (SMS), the guy who filed SPI without notifying me, should also be indef blocked. He has been abusing Indian and Afghan editors, creating and using multiple accounts since at least 2008, illegally uploading many images, using proxies, vandalizing Pashtun related, Afghan related and Indian related pages.  
This SPI investigation report from 2007 clearly establishes that he is a disruptive vandal  and lives in Islamabad, Pakistan , has used socks and open proxy located in Greece. 
 began calling me dark-skinned Indian followed by cursing everyone, and was edit-warring with everyone, and when BBBAAACCC got blocked, an IP (212.174.135.194) from Turkey (a country next to Greece) began revert-warring in order to keep BBBAAACCC's version of pages.
As noted by User:UzEE in the above 2007 report, (SMS) connects himself with Pakistan military. I've noticed that many banned socks have been behaving exactly like SMS and uploading copyrighted images (without permission) relating Pakistan's military, see . According to this recent revert by SMS, he exposed himself that he belongs to a special community within the Hindkowan group, they generally don't associate Pashtuns, and I notice this in SMS's actions. 
He often uses Islamabad IPs to edit, see , , and  and makes other edits by his other socks (User:TopGun  User:MHDH ) so nobody notices but I do because I get paid for doing this )
BBBAAACCC + SMS + TopGun + Ironboy11 + proxies + Islamabad IPs all relate to banned editor , this light-skinned Pakistani guy, the 'Grand Sockmaster' and mass copyright infringer. Clear Proof: 1 2, 3. He often appeared at Siddiqui article since December 2005, used to edit from USA but now from Islamabad. He has been insulting and attacking Indian editors since at least 2007 and has done his recent Indian attack under BBBAAACCC and proxy IPs.",0.0

 UNBLOCK ME YOU ASSHOES! 

{{unblock|HAHAHAHA!!!

One of my favorite and most vivid memories was of a party I attended in high school. It was near the end of the year, and everyone was letting loose. The party had not gotten too badly out of control, and was finally winding down.

I was dating Karen at the time. We'd been going out for about six months. We knew our time together was growing short since we'd soon be heading off to college, she to Radcliffe, and I to Johns Hopkins. We were taking every chance we could to be intimate. I'd been with a few girls before, but Karen had been my first long term intimate relationship, and we'd taught each other lots.

The party was at Keith's house and we were helping him clean up. There were only six of us left, Karen and I, Keith, his girlfriend Linda, Tom and his girlfriend Sue. Linda lived just a few doors down and had invited Karen and Sue to spend the night. Tom was going to spend the night at Keith's house. Conveniently, Linda's parents were out of town until tomorrow noon, so nobody really had anywhere they had to go, and once we'd done a fair job of cleaning up we are able to sit back and relax.

Keith was my best friend. We had a lot in common, even if we were a bit of a """"Mutt and Jeff"""" in appearance. Both of us tall, I had a wide body, result of my Hawaiian ancestry, while he was lean and blonde. I'm 6'1"""" but he had a good 2 inches on me, and had long hair past his shoulders. Mine is brown and curly, and usually just goes whereever it wants. I'm strong as an ox, he's lean and fast. But we had similar taste in women. On more than one occasion I teased him that there was no way he deserved to be with Linda, our high-school goddess, and he was extremely envious that I had Karen, our big-breasted sexy bombshell, as my partner.

Karen and Sue were close friends. If we'd had Diana here, the triumvirate would have been complete. They had all been innocents until that year. Diana was dating, and Karen told me that she and Ryan were 'almost there', doing everything except the final act. Karen hadn't done much of anything until we'd gotten together. But we didn't let grass grow under us, and we made up for a lot of lost time. We'd had sex plenty, and she'd sucked me off more times than I can count. I'd even fucked her incredible tits a couple of times. Sue, it turns out, was the late bloomer. She was still an innocent according to Karen. Kissing was as far as she'd gone, although it seems she'd rubbed Tom's dick through his pants, and he'd had his hands on her mound, even if the underwear was still in the way. But Karen was hinting that this party might be Tom's lucky night.

We were joking about some of the antics that had been going on at the party. Linda in particular was a lurker; she'd sit back and watch all the activities at the party and was always good for a few laughs.

This is one of my frustrations with the notion of civility on Wikipedia, that – like the core content policies – it too can be gamed.  You can show up, as the editor in question showed up, write demeaning things about several editors, further insult their intelligence with a genuinely bogus (not dubious, bogus) argument about sources (to wit, likening Haaretz, Israel's most influential newspaper, to the Cedar Rapids Gazette, arguing that it's of limited weight and significance in an article about Israel-Palestine because of the size of its print run), then deny having made that statement (shrieking """"Strawman! Strawman!""""), then say that others lack """"the grace or honesty to admit"""" that they're lying about it, then make the statement again, then deny the statement, accuse everyone of dishonesty while refusing to clarify the statement, then start playing a """"drinking game"""" and shouting """"BEER"""" oafishly and halitotically in people's faces until...

Until someone points out that you're behaving like a consummate jackass, at which point said editor gets blocked.

I gave the quickest examples I could find. I can find numerous other references to the poppier nature of Van Halen on all three sources. And while I agree a source is not often 100% reliable, especially one relying on opinion...3 major sources IS. Especially given they're frequently used accross Wikipedia. Van Halen began as a hard rock band with a heavy metal edge at times...but """"Dreams"""" is definitely a pop rock song. Generally the 1984 album is considered the one where the band became poppier, and in the Sammy Hagar era that really took root. 

Power ballads are the most common pop rock crossover out there.

Oh, and a lot of their covers were poppy songs anyway, like You Really Got Me.

I have some more stuff below, but first, look at this. I doubt you can be bothered to listen to them all, but listen to the first 30 seconds of each:

As a side note, Bon Jovi's first two albums are definitely glam metal - they made their name as part of the glam metal scene. Which is pop metal by the way, making it hard to classify. They went the commercial side of things and moved away from metal. Guns N' Roses, again, sleaze rock. Something that formed from the ashes of glam metal - but Guns N' Roses were among the first. So the line between sleaze and metal blurs with them. They ARE the crossover point. AC/DC I'd not call metal, and I think KISS had a few metal songs but don't really count...but they are heavily disputed the two of them. Opinions on either carry little weight. 

Wikipedia has several definitions for pop rock: """"Pop rock is a subgenre of rock music that uses """"catchy"""" pop style, with light lyrics over top of """"guitar-based"""" songs"""". I would say that sums up some of Van Halen's stuff to a t. """"they only use pop hooks or synths to appeal to both a hard rock and pop audience from time to time""""? Have you heard their latter-day singles? 

""""Sure they used synth, and sure they've used pop hooks, but haven't countless other hard rock and heavy metal bands done so?""""

It most frequently happened in glam metal. Which is aka pop metal. Glam metal is a genre a lot of people wanted to attach to Van Halen, personally I think just because something's pop rock and heavy metal at different times does not make it pop metal. Hence my desire to keep pop rock - the comparisons to glam metal are made obvious that way. It's hard to ignore them, but also impossible to just call it glam metal.""",0.0

""":Hi. Lots of points, I'll reply as best I can:
Listing the squadrons and their aircraft types is too much /for this article/ but not too much for Wikipedia. Only listing the serial numbers, pilots or other minutiae is too much for Wikipedia. One way you could try would be to create a """"sandbox"""" page for yourself, say User:FFA P-16/Sandbox, write up the squadrons as best you can and then ask at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Aircraft‎ if we can look at it, tidy up the English, etc. and advise on the best page to put it on. Ground instruction airframes are not notable unless there is some special reason, for example if the airframe itself is notable from earlier in its life. 
Re. the ordering of the list, I would have to think about that but it is really a separate discussion. 
You say that the serial numbering (tail numbering) uses a special system. I would like to see this system explained, but it needs just a few examples to show the principles, not the whole list.
If Swiss writers routinely quote the serial number of an aircraft when writing about it, as a way of showing the information contained in the number, then you should be able to reference this. Such references might convince us that the Swiss Air Force is an exception to the general rule. We Wikipedia editors do like to see hard evidence, not just another editor's word. And, as you have noticed, we sadly know little of the Swiss Air Force unless someone can find reliable sources for us. — Cheers,  (Talk)

Unsourced Awards

First of all, thank you  and  for being fair and reasonable in regards to my edits to the Filmography section for this page.  I'm glad this page is finally starting to look like the others of its type found on Wikipedia.  

In regards to """"unsourced and ridiculous awards"""", I have sources for them, as you will see below, and they're not ridiculous.  For example, Meryl Streep's page has her NOMINATED for the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress for The Iron Lady.  This means she ranked in one of the top 5-10 slots for said award, though she didn't win the award itself.  If you peruse her awards section, you will find many critics circle awards she did not win, but was """"nominated"""" for and the same applies to these awards.  This is common not just on Ms. Streep's page, but on other actors/actresses pages as well.  Nonetheless, I've made a compromise by removing Ms. Lange's actual rankings and replacing them """"Nominated"""" as per Ms. Streep's and others' pages.

Oh well done. I'm such a bad boy for """"attacking"""" the """"1st Lord Baron Wikipedia"""". Jesus Christ. All I wanted to know was why the Trayvon Martin case is not on the front page, and now I know - the people making the decisions about such things are just talking utter crap, and people like you who are apparently so threatened by the prospect of the outside world finding this out, you're prepared to shut me up, forcibly (and more despicably, others then remove my comments as if they had never been made at all). Well done. Now the """"1st Lord Baron Wikipedia"""" can feel safe in the knowledge that he doesn't have to exlain why he thinks a 20,000 word article and a 15,000 word article on something that's being reported around the world, has """"negligible encyclopedic value"""". And now someone who calls himself a bucket thinks the Lord was simply exercising """"most right and proper good humor"""" in acting that way. And the person going around erasing all my comments to hide them from outsiders calls himself a """"Rambling Man"""". Very apt. This isn't an encyclopedia, it's a playground. It only remains to be seen what the name """"Bishonen"""" means, but I doubt it's anything remotely intellectual, probaby just a cartoon reference or something. You can block me for 48 hours, but on this evidence, Wikipedia is going to be a poor excuse of a website encyclopedia for life. On further investigation, the 1st Lord seems to have got me blocked by crying to admins, which seems apt, seeing as he's probably just a child himself. Presumably the use of the phrase """"Bishonen with her finger on the trigger"""" over there waa meant to be funny, but given the context of my complaint, it's just rather tragic. Still, back to the real world, where the Trayvon Martin case is actually real news, and the issues it involves are of encyclopedic value. I've found the articles myself without the help of the front page, but apparently anyone else looking for them can just go to hell (in a bucket?). All, you Lords, Hell Buckets and Rambling men get back to whatever the fuck it is you do around here, which is cleearly not creating a useful encyclopedia (at least you don't seem to be getting in the way of the people who actually managed to write the articles on the shooting and trial, so thank fuck for that).""",0.14285714285714285

This is why, I believe the better way to calm things out is to go for the conservative option which is to use the same image in the English version than the one used in the French version. An image which is a good consensus as it does show the Eiffel Tower, the undisputed symbol of the city, but also its urban surrounding landscape and its full dimension as a metropolis. That's the only way in my humble opinion to reach WP:NPOV in this case.",0.0

Since then similar efforts have been organized for other 2008 presidential candidates.[citation needed]
Sample comment: This seems to be a fine summary statement, reliably sourced in the article such as by UPI. We can just copy the footnote refs to it.   
The popular usage of """"moneybomb"""" to describe a coordinated mass donation drive for a political candidate can be traced to a weekly donation drive, the Ron Paul Money Bomb, which aimed to raise $1 million each week for Ron Paul's presidential campaign.[2][citation needed] (Daily Paul)
Jesse Elder, a New York City jazz pianist,[3][4] registered the new identity """"RonPaulMoneyBomb"""" at YouTube;[5][citation needed] (New York Times, All About Jazz, YouTube)
Eric Nordstrom then registered the identical .com domain.[6][citation needed] (Network Solutions)
Supporters of Mike Huckabee organized a moneybomb on November 20 to commemorate International Children's Day, which raised nearly $225,000, well over the pledged amount, bringing Huckabee's monthly total to $1 million as of November 20th.[11][citation needed] (Nov20ForTheChildren)
Supporters of Dennis Kucinich's presidential campaign are also using the term """"moneybomb"""" to describe their own major fundraising drive aimed for December 15, 2007, the anniversary of the Bill of Rights coming into effect.[12][citation needed] (News and Policy)
Proposed on November 6 on Daily Kos, the drive has an ultimate goal for 100,000 pledges of $100.[13][citation needed] (December152007)
Kucinich supporters are using viral advertising techniques to promote the drive by putting up YouTube videos and circulating them throughout the web.[citation needed]
Along with generating a significant amount of donations for a political candidate, a moneybomb can also generate significant media interest in a largely unknown candidate.[citation needed]
In addition to the media coverage, the November 5 drive was able to get 21,000 new donors to the campaign, over half of the donors on that day.[18][citation needed] (AP)
While there is no definitive link, after November 5, Ron Paul saw a measurable rise in the polls, showing the potential ability for a moneybomb to improve a candidate's place in a political campaign.[20][21][citation needed] (TransWorldNews, NBC4)""",0.0

Later you will see that  Sitush interjects and gives some lousy reasons for his numerous reverts to the article which are academically illogical, but  ever trigger happy with the revert button Sitush|talk]] goes about his business as master referee. Its the same story with other articles Sitush has edited on Wikipedia. Some long standing editors have got impatient with him.

Dear Jonathan

I agree with WP:OR but if you read the sources on the article carefully and compare it with the guidelines to quote """"The prohibition against OR means that all material added to articles must be attributable to a reliable published source, even if not actually attributed""""

Here is the list of attributable reliable sources of the article which were republished and meet the guidelines:

There are Papers from the AN Seely Collection: This a a British Library Publication 1972, which is a reputable Publishing House. AN Seely the author was a fellow of Trinity College Oxford, and a scholar in Persian Studies. He compiled these from the original sources and they were published.

Title: Caste in the Subah of Oudh Army by AN Seely Collection Area: India Office Records and Private Papers Reference: IOR/L/MIL/14/223 Creation Date: 1890-1895 Extent and Access: Extent: 1 volume The India Office Records are the repository of the archives of the East India Company (1600-1858), the Board of Control or Board of Commissioners for the Affairs of India (1784-1858), the India Office (1858-1947), the Burma Office (1937-1948), and a number of related British agencies overseas. The focus of the India Office Records is in the territories now included in India, Pakistan, Burma and Bangladesh and their administration before 1947. The Records also include source materials for neighbouring or connected areas at different times, covering not only South Asia, but also Southeast Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East, and parts of Africa. The official archives of the India Office Records are complemented by over 300 collections and over 3000 smaller deposits of private papers relating to the British experience in India. The India Office Records are administered by The British Library as part of the Public Records of the United Kingdom, and are open for public consultation.

NOW HERE SITUSH GIVES HIS CLASSIC REASON FOR DESTROYING THIS ACADEMIC ARTICLE. ITS CLEAR THE FELLOW HAS NOT HAD ANY RESEARCH EXPERIENCE OR AUTHORED ANY ACADEMIC WORK 

It doesn't matter who published the papers: the underlying content is primary material. For example, there have been similar issues regarding the works of Henry Miers Elliot, who basically reproduced ancient Indian texts. I know some members of the Seely family, as it happens, but diaries, letters, office reports etc are not reliable sources. Someone needs to write a book about them, not a book containing them. Furthermore, Raj sources generally are not deemed to be reliable, and especially not for matters of caste and history. - Sitush (talk) 

""""(The above is classic Sitush)""""

MY COMMENTS REGARDING SITUSH'S REMARKS

Sitush you are an ass. I do not know who let you loose on Wikipedia, NCRT textbooks are writtin from the sources in the India Office Archive. Every historical work including that of Seely depends to some extent on primary sources that work has been published and the authors of the Singahi article have cited from it. These are spurious and non academic grounds of objecting to the article. Its just making mischief, I invite anybody from a higer academic background to examine all Sitush Sitush (talk) edits.

Examining Sitush|talk]]) edits all over Wikipedia as I have done establishes he is a menace and taking wikipedia backwards. Sitush I suspect you are just a 14 year old kid treating wikipedia as a toy.

Dude, sorry for the rough language, but you are one fucking dumbass idiot. Everything I type is extremely intelligible and free-flowing, if you will, yet you seem to interpret it WAY differently than it is obviously stated. My sentence, """"You seem to think that this is some sort of """"battle of the dialects"""" (lol), and seem to think that this is what I seem to think (now, that's redundant!) as well, but as I've CLEARLY stated, this is not so"""", makes perfect sense and only an idiot would not understand it. I wrote it redundantly to prove a point, not because I lack verbal skills. The point being, that you are an idiot and you can't understand the symbolic (or even literal) nature of my posts, and you interpret it into something that somehow benefits you and your cozy little world view. Ok, this will be the 100TH time I've had to clear something up for you, but let me tell you what this sentence means:

You seem to think this is a """"battle of the dialects"""". At the same time, you assume I am thinking the same thing. However, I DO NOT think of this as a """"battle of the dialects"""" at all, I think of it as a LOGICAL consensus that needs to replace the current one.

If you discerned something other than this, than you are retarded, hands down. I can't understand why you make all these radical interpretations, especially when most of my words are plainly visible. I am in NO WAY contradicting myself here, and if you can't understand this, then I am in NO WAY going to argue with the mentally retarded, for the guilt would prevent me from having peace of mind for quite some time.

"""==bcm versus km³==
Dear Gene Nygaard,
You said that generally everyone understands km³. I am not sure about this statement and find this use quite unusual and misleading. Could you please give any example in gas industry where km³ is used (maybe just some newspaper article)? Also, if youd could find any article in wikipeedia about gas fileds or pipelines, which use km³, I would like to get a reference.  

Google """"natural gas"""" """"km3""""  823 hits

Note that Google, as far as I know, won't search for the ³ character, but this gets those that use either html superscripts, or just """"km3"""" and the like.

There are other ways to find more of them.  You will of course find many using bcm as well.  But as I pointed out, that may be jargon used within the industry, but it is not known outside the industry (there might possibly be other little pockets of its usage in other contexts, even less known). 

another search, on AltaVista:
km³ """"natural gas"""" 3130 hits. 

AltaVista appears to treat ³ and 3 as synonymous, unlike Google. You can limit them to .gov sites, or to .edu sites, too, to see that this isn't """"newspaper usage"""" but in fact more likely to take place in more serious and professional contexts.  

BTW, if you were arguing about """"tcf"""" you'd maybe have a better case.  That is common enough in the industry, more so than """"bcm"""", that it is better known outside the industry, too.  

I am able to use different search engages. However, could you please give any example of use km³  as an unit of capacity of gas pipeline? Concerning tcf (trillion cubic feet) - it's used more in the US gas industry, while bcm is used mainly in Europe. Don't see problem with this. If you look the external links of this artcile, you will find both: tcf and bcm, depending of the source.

 In the petroleum industry the unit systems used are Oilfield and Metric like what was mentoned above, all depending on where you are and who you are working with. However I have never come across km³ being used to describe gas field sizes or gas production and if someone was to describe a field or gas production in such a way to someone in the industry it would have no revelace to them, it is not a standard of unit. It would have to be Bcm, Mcm, E3M3, Bcf, Tcf, MMscf, Mscf etc.   

Surely, we writing for a general audience not only for people in certain industries.  km³ is standard SI if some people in some industry want to use something else, then that's their problem.  P.S. Hello Gene. ɪmp 

 Very true Jimp we are writing for a general audience. And when i searched some news articles by the likes of Forbes, CNN Money etc on Google news in the past month for the phrase km3 in relation to gas/gasfield/ gas field/ """"natural gas"""" it returns one result from Petroleum World. However the units tcf, bcf, bcm return   at least 102, 147,  51 hits when used with the above phrases. And these are from Forbes, Reuters, CNN Money, Globe and mail which i think you would agree are also writing for the General Audience. The numbers are in their hundreds of thousands when you do just a general web search for tcf, bcf and bcm compared to the 823 km3 turns up. So its not really just """"some people in some industry"""" using these terms.  Cheers  
Sure it is.  But that's beside the point; we at Wikipedia choose to use standard unit symbols, not all the various off-the-cuff possibilities, and km³ is the standard symbol for 1,000,000,000 m³.  It isn't surprising at all that financial magazines are too innumerate when it comes to units of measure to even understand what they are, so sure they get passed on unchanged.  So what?

Why don't we try to resolve this issue on this talk page, rather than going back and forth with edit wars?

Also, Generation Jones is certainly relevant to this.  It's not that Wiki editors have to """"face the claim that a Generation Jones exists"""", as you say.

User:JimWae, the part your assessment relevant to my compromise version, is for the most part, incorrect, and furthermore, you have acknowledged that you do not have references that support your claims. If you looked at the references that qualified the statement regarding the """"propagating atheism,"""" you would find that it is a factual statement. And once again, this article is not about state atheism exclusively, but about the ideology of militant atheism, which was applied to some atheist states; an atheist state could exist, without promoting militant atheism. Your version of the introduction eliminates defining the ideology of militant atheism as given by several references and summarized in the Concepts section of the article; the lede should define the ideology and then talk about its Application, which parallels the structure of the article, namely the headings listed in the article's table of contents. Furthermore, contrary to your opinion, militant atheism is an integral part of Marxism-Leninism, as supported by the consequent references. For example, Faith and Order: The Reconciliation of Law and Religion, specifically states:  When discussing content, you must keep in mind WP:RS, rather than your original research. You assert that many people do not know about the Cultural Revolution and for this reason, it should be removed from the paragraph. That argument does not hold any water whatsoever, as this is an encylopædia. Moreover, removing the information on the concept of militant atheism, the Cultural Revolution, French Revolution, and political thinkers, violates WP:LEDE, which states """"The lead should be able to stand alone as a concise overview of the article."""" Your revision of the introduction fails to do this. If the term """"Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution"""" is not as common, however, I would not mind compromising and changing it to just """"Cultural Revolution.""""

That is right. Thus put the number of other nation death close to German casulties. Putting the numbers separately suggests you “selective” intentions. One cry about his looses and forgot about the offended party casualties. I say put first think first. I proposed to mark in first sentence that the expulsion was direct result of Nazi German aggression and unprecedented savagery. Is not truth?
>When someone tries to rape a child or to burn it alive and you do not help it because your intervention depends on the ethnic background of the child, I would seriously question your moral integrity!
That is right. Unfortunately German Nazi did it and why? Germans supported Hitler so much or what? Why the Germans did not stop Hitler before he got to much power? Etc. etc. That question the ethic of all nation is not it? And, are you referring by some accident to others then the Nazis actions? Where is the proof that some bandits of Polish nationality did it? Do not you accuses others for German Nazi attitude just for “moral” confort?
>The same when you help to conceal this incident – that would be a ( retrospective ) participation in this incident or at least an act of aiding and a betting it.
You are damn right? So what is you explanation to Hitler success? Why he was not stopped before WW II started?
>But this article is not about moral philosophy, it is supposed to be an objective description of a specific issue – based on quantitative research. And it should be left to the reader to come to a ( subjective ) conclusion.
I do not think the spreading of ESTIMATIOM is quantitative research. I challenge you to provide international research result. And about the subjective reader conclusion, let me remain you Dr. G. says: “A lie repeated many times become truth.”

 Current Speculation 

There has been discussion lately about the appropriateness of this section. I will be going out-of-town for the next 5 days, but in my absence I highly encourage the frequent editors of this section to realize the need (and act upon it) to permanently remove this section. Its existence violates:

  NPOV (nuetral point of view)

- No one can truly say how or even if the listed items will affect voters

Types of bias include:

Ethnic or racial bias, including racism, nationalism and regionalism. 
Corporate bias, including advertising, coverage of political campaigns in such a way as to favor corporate interests, and the reporting of issues to favor the interests of the owners of the news media. 
Class bias, including bias favoring one social class and bias ignoring social or class divisions. 
Political bias, including bias in favor of or against a particular political party or candidate. 
Religious bias, including bias in which one religious viewpoint is given preference over others. 
Sensationalism, which is bias in favor of the exceptional over the ordinary. This includes the practice whereby exceptional news may be overemphasized, distorted or fabricated to boost commercial ratings. 
Geographical bias which may for example describe a dispute as it is conducted in one country without knowing that the dispute is framed differently elsewhere. 

The presence of this section is biased on several of the basses listed above

Wikipedia articles are not:

Propaganda or advocacy of any kind. Of course, an article can report objectively about such things, as long as an attempt is made to approach a neutral point of view. You might wish to go to Usenet or start a blog if you want to convince people of the merits of your favorite views. You can also use Wikinfo which promotes a """"sympathetic point of view"""" for every article. 

This article is adversely some ones' political movement.

I would say that the bottom line is if independent reliable sources describe Cox as Catholic, then we can go with that. The difference is that Cox belongs to a schismatic organization that is several levels removed from the Catholic Church.

Note that the Catholic Church affirmed that attendance at an SSPX chapel would fulfill the Sunday obligation, i.e. in a """"Catholic rite"""". I do not know if the Catholic Church has commented on the canonical status of the Irish Orthodox Catholic and Apostolic Church, or the validity of the Thuc line of apostolic succession.

Proposed paragraphs
""""Option 1"""" below shows the two paragraphs he (Hafen) is proposing. Now that I have read the Wiki guidelines suggested to me here and in other places, I can see that this might not fly. But I need to be able to tell him I tried with the text he suggested. I have another idea for a different approach that might be more acceptable (see option 2mine,  after option 1his). I would like your feedback.

Current: (to be replaced) Hafen denies that there is a biological link to sexual orientation, stating that same-sex attraction is """"not in your DNA"""". He says that the American Psychological Association was politically motivated to remove homosexuality from its list of mental disorders.

Option 1:
As a Professor of Law at BYU from 1973-1996, his teaching and research focused on family law and education law, with particular interests in the legal rights of children and in the legal status of marriage.  A sample of his scholarly articles includes publications in the Harvard Law Review, Harvard International Law Journal, Michigan Law Review, Duke Law Journal, Ohio State Law Journal, and the American Bar Association Journal. Two of his articles were cited in opinions of the U.S. Supreme Court. He has been an invited speaker at professional conferences on family, education, and constitutional law in a variety of international and domestic locations.

In a 2009 speech in Utah, Hafen spoke to Evergreen International, a support group for people who desire to overcome their own same-gender attraction. A portion of his remarks summarized “the secular case against same-gender marriage.” He cited the 2006 decision of the French parliament rejecting gay marriage so that children “do not suffer as a result of situations imposed on them by adults.  The interest of the child must outweigh the exercise of freedom by adults, whatever life choices are made by the parents.”  He also stated that same-sex attraction is “not in your DNA,” observing that while “inherited susceptibilities” and “natural personality traits do influence one’s inclinations” toward same-gender attraction, the “idea that there is a ‘gay gene’” that determines gender attraction “has little scientific support.”  He stated that the gay rights movement represents “an aggressive political movement” more than it represents “substantive change in the medical or legal evidence.”  For example, he said, the decision of the American Psychological Association to remove homosexuality from its list of mental disorders in 1973 came from “putting the issue to an open vote in their professional meetings—not because of any change in actual medical findings.” 

Option 2
In a 2009 speech in Utah, Hafen spoke to Evergreen International, a support group for people who desire to overcome their own same-gender attraction. His address generated a wide range of responses and was reported on in Salt Lake City's two major newspapers: the Salt Lake Tribuneand the Deseret News.
(I was thinking/hoping this would be neutral, because the Tribune gave a less-than-favorable report and the Deseret News gave a more favorable report. Referencing the two could offer some balance.)

Well, let's see. The first subchapter is §8.5 The Problem of Division by Zero. This he follows up with 8.7 Five approaches to Division by Zero, which I will repeat in its entirety. This will take more than one sitting to type in. The following is from Suppes 1957:163-169:
1 """"The first approach differs from the others in that it recommends a change in the baseic logic to deny meaning to expressions like: ¶ 1/0 = 1/0 ¶ Without attempting to characterize the basic changes necessary, we may still offer some general objections to this approach...."""" [more to follow tomorrow]
2 """"The second approach is to let x/0 be a real number, but to define division by the conditional definition stated in the last section: IF y≠0 Then x/y = z if and only if x = y*z. In this case for every number x, x/0 is a real number, but we are not able to prove what number it is. ¶ (2) 1/0 = 2/0 ¶ The inability to prove or disprove (2) is an argument against the second approach, since we want our axioms to be as complete as possible.""""
3 The third approach agrees with the second in making x/0 a real number, but it differes in making x/0 = 0 for all x. This eliminates the undecidability of statements like (2). For the third approach the appropriate definition of division is a proper definition similar to the axiom-free definition discussed at the end of §8.5:
 x/y = z ←→ [y ≠ 0 → x = y*z) & (y = 0 → z = 0)
 """"An advantage of the third approach is that it permits the definition of zero by a straight forward proper definition fully satisfying the criteria of elminability and non-creativity. The main disadvante of this appraoch is the one mentioned in §8.5: many mathematicians feel uneasy with the identity: ¶ x/0 = 0.
4 The forth approach agrees with the second and third in requiring no basic change of logic; it differes in not making it possible to prove that x/0 is a real number. The basic idea is to introduce a predicate 'R' which means 'is a real number.' Hypotheses using this predicate must be added to all the axioms stated in Chapter 7. Furthermore, to guarantee that addition and multiplication of numbers yield numbers, we must add the two closure axioms:
 R(x) & R(y) → R(x+y)
 R(x) & R(y) → R(x*y).
""""The introduction of the predicate 'R' widens our domain of individuals, for now it does not follow that everything in the domain is a real number (in particular the 1/0 is a real number). The indroduction of 'R' has the further consequence of making it natural to make all our definitions of arithmetical relations and operations conditional. There is no point in defining the realition of equal to or less than, for instance, for things which are not numbers. Thus we would ahve:
 [R(x) & R(y)] → [x ≤ y ←→ (x = y V x < y)].
""""The definition of division would be:
""""(3) [R(x) & R(y)& R(z) & y ≠ 0 ] → [x/y = z ←→ x = y*z].
""""If x is a real number, with (3) at hand we cannot prove:
""""x/0 is a real number
""""And we cannot prove:
""""x/0 is not a real number,
""""But we are not faced with the counterintuitive situation of being forced to call x/0 a real number. The situation can be improved by introducing into our system a primitive symbol for some object which is not a real number. Without saying what the object is, let us designate it by 'v'. They we have the axiom:
""""-R(v) [here - is ~ or bent bar, i.e. NOT]
""""that is, the assertion that v is not a real number. We may now definie division by:
""""(4) [R(x) & R(y)] → [x/y = z ←→ [y ≠ 0 → (R(z) & x = y*z)) & (y = 0 → z = v]].
""""The virtue of (4) is that it definitely places x/0 outside the domain of real numbers for any number x. Such a consequence would seem to be in closest accord with ordinary mathematical usage. Definition (4) also has the virtue of making
 x/0 = y/0 ,
""""Where x and y are real numbers, thus eliminating a vast proliferation of odd mathematical entities. On the other hand, to see once for all that all is not for the best in this best of all possible worlds, notice that if we adopt (4) we cannot decide whether or not v/v is a real number. If we use conditioncal dfinitions and insist on not tampering with the basic law of identity for therms, then we must be prepared for the undecidability of the statue so fentities like v/v. We make thake the attitude that everything is in good order in the domain where we intend to use the division operation, and we really do not care what is going on elsewhere if not inconsistencies can creap in.

 Prof Rachel Baskerville´s Capital Maintenance contribution 

Prof Baskerville,

You are not allowed on Wikipedia to qoute yourself. It is called Conflict of Interest. This is a Wikipedia policy.

I may quote or add comments from your excellent work to Wikipedia, but, you cannot do it yourself. 

Your contribution which is a direct quote from your SSRN publication is also not encyclopedic - as they say over here on Wikipedia.

I also disagree with what you are stating. We can discuss this matter here on this discussion page as it is normally done on Wikipedia. I appreciate that you are new on Wikipedia and that you are a well known and top of the class academic.

Herewith then the contribution from Prof Baskerville that I removed from the article:

""""This the IASB Framework  describes (as above) how capital maintenance is undertaken in two ways:
Firstly, “A financial concept of capital is adopted by most entities in preparing their financial statements. Under a financial concept of capital, such as invested money or invested purchasing power, capital is synonymous with the net assets or equity of the entity”. 
So most entities undertake to report that they have maintained their financial capital and do not report physical capital maintenance. 

Secondly, you may find some public sector entities consider that their stewardship responsibilities are best served by also reporting physical capital maintenance e.g. is the capacity of the waterworks, waste water system etc in the local town the same as, or better, than it was last year? Some Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) will be chosen to report this. The Framework states:
“Under a physical concept of capital, such as operating capability, capital is regarded as the productive capacity of the entity based on, for example, units of output per day”.  These are two ‘concepts of capital’. 

Thirdly, and this is confusing, a legal meaning in the UK arose as follows: English law developed the ‘doctrine of capital maintenance’ with the aim of ensuring that a company cannot return its share capital back to its shareholders as dividends. The ‘doctrine of capital maintenance’ underpins the legal rules addressing

-TABpayment of dividends to shareholders;
-TABreduction of a company’s share capital or reserves;
-TABa company’s purchase of its own shares

and other aspects. From October 2008 private companies in the UK will be allowed to reduce their share capital without the need to go to court"""".
So when a commercial lawyer is discussing capital maintenance they may be referring to this third concept.Baskerville, Rachel F., 100 Questions (and Answers) About IFRS (January 24, 2010). Available from SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1526846

I will still add my points of disagreement with Prof Baskervilles contribution.

"What an irony? The very policies that are used to protect articles on Wikipedia are been exploited by some editors and nobody at Wikipedia can do anything. Nobody has any rights to stop editors who go on a rampage over an article just because of some pov of theirs, using the very policies of Wikipedia used to protect articles. I guess there is no system of checking the edits of such editors against vandalisation such that they can blatantly claim that whatever you report to authorities nobody is going to listen. This is not according to Wikipedia standards and also not healthy with respect to protection of articles on Wikipedia. 

Protection should be such that deletion and blanking should not be allowed to editors other than the author of the article or administrators. This would curtail vandalism to a great extend. It will also stop vulturism in editing wherein editors who do not contribute with any articles but just pick on other editor's articles for whatever reasons would be discouraged and genuine critics would be encouraged who will follow the procedure of mentioning on talk pages for editing.

Furthermore if there are issues it can be discussed in talk pages and updation made accordingly. 

If any author does not log in for specific period of time the article may be alloted to another editor or taken up by adminstrator or it can be locked and put up as library content which can be edited by any administrator. 

This would add international standards as one expects on Wikipedia and also encourge authors to provide more contribution.

Anyway still it is a huge effort by Wikipedia to maintain such a huge collection of articles, it does not matter if a few articles get deleted or vandalised or removed from Wikipedia just because some pov of some editors. I understand to gain something one has to loose something. It is perfectly alright for all administrators and other authorities not to do anything and watch an article getting ripped of part by part.

 Camille Paglia: sex-positive feminist 

Here are the supporting links you asked for, you stupid twit!

http://www.lotl.com/content/paglia.htm

http://www.reference.com/browse/wiki/Sex-positive_feminism

If you are too lazy and full of yourself to read them in their entirety then I will just post the relevant sections here:

Camille Paglia: """"On the other hand I’ve been saying in public for five years ago, as someone who’s endorsed prostitutes and strippers and that whole extreme of sex-positive experience, that I’m concerned about the effect on young people – people growing up from 8, 10, 14 in a climate where it’s gone to the opposite direction. I’m already out there concerned about this so I’m really outraged to be stereotyped in that way by her because I am a career teacher and yes, when you have a situation where commercialised sex is being pushed without a true eroticism…I’ve been saying this for years, that we have got to a point of meaningless exhibitionism without real eroticism. I’m for eroticism."""" 

Camille Paglia is a major American social critic. Paglia's academic writing focuses on the role of vibrant dangerous sexuality in human history. Paglia's key importance to sex-positive feminism is not only her writings on sex, but her advocacy of """"traditional"""" values like canon texts. Paglia is somewhat of an intellectual enigma, a conservative and academic feminist, who revels in low and high culture alike and celebrates sexualities disapproved of by mainstream Western culture. Paglia has, in many ways, presented a """"respectable"""" face for pro-sex feminism to the world at large.""",0.14285714285714285

""":Hi Labongo. Just to clarify a little, the criterion about self-identification as an indigenous people is actually one that is frequently and explicitly used by the major sources and bodies concerned with indigenous peoples' affairs and status. It was paraphrased a little for the article, but if you examine a few of the most-consulted definitions (such as UN, World Bank, ILO, etc) you will see that it's embedded in many of these formulations, with a deliberate intent. See for example the definitional quotes from these organisations, that used to be in the 'definitions' section of this article but now seems to have been split off into Definitions of the term Indigenous. As such, I think the criterion needs to remain mentioned along with the others that appear in the opening paras.

The statement """"Note that even if all the above criteria are fulfilled, some people may either not consider themselves as indigenous or may not be considered as indigenous by governments, organizations or scholars"""" does not quite mean the same thing. While that statement itself is fine as far as it goes, IMO it's not an adequate replacement. Self-identification and recognition is part of the """"set"""" of criteria that are often referred to in indigenous rights contexts.

I can see some rationale in the recent splitting out of the former content of the 'definitions' section into that separate article, however at the same time I think that this present indigenous peoples article does need to devote perhaps more space than we usually do to covering definitions and usage of terms/terminology. It's an area where there's a lot of general misconception and confusion between the common, adjectival and the formal, specific usage of words like indigenous, and even of the concept of indigenous peoples' rights and concerns (a lot of the discourse on this talkpg and others related are along these lines, for eg.) I think we could probably spare a few more paras to cover the most salient points and prominent definitions, so the detail's not all spliced away into a different article. Thoughts?  ʘ TALK

"Here's another go!

In biology, evolution refers to the processes that cause some inherited traits to become more common relative to others over time. Natural selection, the most important of these, works because some traits or collections of traits will, on average, increase reproductive success, either by protecting the organism from dying before it can reproduce, or by enhancing his reproductive success directly, such as the peacock's plumage. As genes are passed on by reproduction, those that increase reproductive success are more likely to be passed on, relative to neutral or relatively unfavourable traits, and so, generation to generation, the number of organisms with these traits will tend to increase, unless conditions change so as to make them no longer favourable. Other, less important mechanisms of change include gentic drift (random changes in frequency of traits, most important when the traits are, at that time, reproductively neutral), and the founder effect, in which, if a small group of organisms become isolated from the main population, that isolated population will, even many generations on, tend to have a higher frequency of any rare variations in the founders as compared to the original, larger population.

Over time, the accumulation of many of these inherited changes can result in the development of new species from existing ones,  a process called speciation. [Explain major routes of speciation: geographical differences, isolation, divergence into seperate niches, etc]

[Simple evidence, probably the Universal genetic code] and other discoveries have shown that this mechanism can be traced back to a single common ancestor, from which all living organisms on Earth descended as a result of cumulative evolutionary change over billions of years, making evolution responsible for the vast diversity of life on Earth, including the many extinct species found in the fossil record.

"""Hi, I'm . I'd like to personally welcome you and thank you for your contributions thus far. As you probably know, Wikipedia is a free encyclopedia collaboratively written entirely by volunteers. If you ever see anything that can be improved—be it correcting a typo or writing a new article—don't be afraid to fix it yourself! Don't worry about making mistakes; one of the many editors will probably notice and quickly correct it. If you have any questions, just place the text {{helpme}} on your talk page, and an administrator will help you shortly. Alternatively, you could join the #wikipedia-en-help IRC channel, where dozens of friendly helpers await. You can find out more about the project here, but I won't bore you with statistics and rules. Just remember to be civil to other editors, to always cite your sources, and to write articles from a neutral point of view, and you should be good to go.

Wikipedia is a huge website; with  articles, it is the single biggest encyclopedia in the world. Additionally, there are thousands of policy and process pages, so it can be a bit overwhelming, even to experienced users. When I was new, I found the Tutorial particularly helpful. You might also want to check out the glossary. This page serves as our library reference desk, where you can ask nearly any question imaginable.

The Featured Articles and Good Article pages are good places to look for some of our most well-written and comprehensive articles. On the other end of the spectrum, we have thousands of articles that require cleanup of some sort, so feel free to help out. In particular, many biographies of living persons need to be sourced properly; while this task can be a bit difficult, it's of a highly important nature.

I hope you've found this advice helpful. Feel free to contact me for more information. –'''''' | Talk """,0.0

 removing aircrash investigation additions and calling them spam en third class publications 

Someone (AndyTheGrump)is accusing me of putting information about aircraft investigations as third class spam mail on wikipedia. This is outrageous and completely ridiculous. I am a aviation specialist, I was general manager of large airports (among others Schiphol International Airport Amsterdam), a professor in economics (graduated Erasmus University, Rotterdam, Netherlands in 1973) and a consultant for many governments world wide (a.o. Netherlands, Indonesia, Chad, Philippines) on issues regarding aviation. I can proof that on every account. The problem with aviation accidents is that every country makes it own report of the accident, many are not in English, not everybody uses the metric system, there are problems in terminology, etc.  Many reports are not easy to obtain, some governments simply refuse to make reports available for international students and/or mechanics in aviation. This is very frustrating for people working in this field. Not everybody is American, there are also Asians, Africans, Russians, etc. who are entitled to the same knowledge as you and me. For this reason we publish these reports all in the same style and the same format and all in English. This makes comparison easy. Because we (a number of retired pilots) are talking over small series and the information has to be available for many years we found the solution in publishing them as print in demand by lulu.com. I do not see what is wrong with this. Publishing via a normal publisher means that the series are too large and after a certain time the publication is no more available, they also become too expensive for people in countries that are not so """"blessed"""" as Americans.  You should appreciate what we do instead of insulting us, we are simply acting on requests of the industry. You are apparently some kind of Johnny the Selfkicker.

You say that dogs were eaten in Saxony, which is not in Austria but in Germany. The source material you cite, it confusingly talks about things happening in both countries, so it was an easy mistake to make.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

I rechecked the source, and see that the Saxony section is definitely separate from the Austria section. I decided to just change the section title from """"Austria"""" to """"Saxony"""", since that is more accurately what the article says (and doesn't get into the complexity of how old kingdoms map onto present day ones).

I think  is making a distinction between IS and OUGHT. Activities within a process SHOULD add value, but sometimes they don't. Within BPR, people often make a distinction between """"As-Is"""" processes and """"To-Be"""" processes. Perhaps it would be useful to make this explicit within the article. 

However, complex processes may include activities whose value-add is obscure or difficult to quantify. For example, a salesman carries out some social chat prior to demonstrating the product, and this possibly converts the customer to a more receptive state. A craftsman may play around with the materials before starting construction, which may possible put him into a more creative/innovative state. But do we really want to engineer every business conversation or playful bricolage to optimize some desired state-transition? This is BPR not NLP.

 False inormation in the article 
As you would expect, the propagandists would say and do everything to mislead us. They once again proved themselfs to be the proven LIARS we alreayd knew they were since the article wrongly states that the darker picture with the """"fall-off"""" effects is the edited one, which is pure BS.

The original photo is the one with the """"fall-off"""" effect which was printed in The West Australian already back in august 2, 1969 (~6 min in this clip http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMuTiziCszU) while the lighten up picture is the EDITED version who came out much later. So unless the propaganda trolls cant find a version of THEIR claimed original version dated EARLIER than august second 1969, i suggest them to SHUTUP.

Youtube is not a reliable source for information about a conspiracy theory. Is there a reliable source available that supports your claim?   

 The Buzz Alrdin photo is explained at Examination_of_Apollo_Moon_photographs#Issues with crosshairs in photos.   You talkin' to me? 

The video shows a guy holding up the actual newspaper from 2 aug 1969 to prove that the """"fall-off"""" picture is how the original one looked like, but then its youtube who isnt a reliable source!?  your desperate try for making a point is laughable... but i wouldnt expect more from a propaganda TROLL.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 91.145.38.53   

 No, that newspaper doesn't show what the original one looks like.  The original is a transparency that is in NASA's vaults.  They made prints that were widely reprinted. See this for more information.  You talkin' to me? 

Bullshit! excuses from NASA wont make it true! you have the history of that picture in the video i linked to and even the NASA site you linked to shows the fact that the darker picture is the first one, the original from 1969, while the more lighten edited version came out 1975. So why you arguing? you dont have a chance here. As i said, BRING UP a picture dated earlier than 2 aug 1969 or SHUTUP - its that simple!

91.145.38.53, please stop insulting other editors and please sign your posts, just put four tildes at the end .   

I dont tolerating having my talk session closed, this is what the propagandists do? censoring their opponents!
Unless the propagandists cant bring up the picture THEY claim to be the original together with a date which needs to be earlier than second of august 1969, i will change the article. False misleading information should never be tolerated! Its already proven that the """"fall-off"""" darker version IS the original. If anyone wants to argue, then bring up! 91.145.38.53  

 The propaganda liars 
This article is beyond laughable! Since the propagandists trash talking and like to """"debunk"""" ppl like Bart Sibrel, Ralph Rene, and Bill Kaysing (with no evidence to debunk them, however) we should debunk the LIARS the propagandists listen to!  """"youtube is not a reliable source"""" the propagandists says... still they link to youtube videos themselfs to suit their false propaganda in a desperate act to try prove THEIR laughable points. So if they can link to youtube videos, i will do the same just to prove that THEIR sources are nothing else than FALSE PROPAGANDA. Using proven liars like Jay Windley, Phil Plait, and Svectors youtube series as some kinda evidence is laughable.

"""I am not sure. If the word """"denialist"""" is new (which it is), you are unlikely to find a source calling an organization 100 or 150 years ago """"denialist"""". You might find all the characteristics of what denialism is of course. 

It depends on how you define denialism. If we define it very narrowly, we will only end up with 1 or 2 topics in the category of denialism, which clearly is wrong given the similarities of human behavior in those one or two areas with those in other subjects. 

I believe we should do what dictionaries do when they define a word: we look at prominent sources like the New York Times, the New York Review of Books, the London Times, the Economist, the Wall Street Journal, Academic  journals, scholarly writing, popular novels, etc to see how the word is used. For a new word, this determines its meaning, until a family of dictionary editors codifies this set of meanings as a family of different definitions that are published in dictionaries. Since we are not yet at the dictionary publication stage, but at the earlier pre- dictionary publication stage, we have to do more of the hard work ourselves. That is all. 

It is clearly a common word, in common usage, at least in some subject areas. One rarely hears the word """"AIDS denier"""" although that is essentially what an """"AIDS denialist"""" is (parenthetically noting that in fact an AIDS denialist is really an """"HIV denialist"""", properly speaking). And I suspect the phrase """"Holocaust denier"""" will fade from usage now that the new word """"denialist"""" seems to be gaining popularity. 

If one maintains that there are two separate groups, denialists and deniers, then why are there no AIDS deniers? Why no HIV deniers? Only denialists? Seems a bit strange, given that human behavior is not much different in all these cases; only the topic changes. The denying stays the same. 

If putting someone in a denialism category constitutes libel, then a very large number of publications worldwide have put themselves in legal jeopardy by publishing articles on AIDS denialists and other kinds of denialists. Given that these publications have full time legal staff and large legal budgets, and the people making these claims on Wikipedia are not lawyers or legal experts, this claim seems dubious at best. 

If we accept the gratuitous personal assertions of some that denialism is really a political movement that involves personal gain, then creationists, creation scientists and intelligent design promoters fall in this category. If """"denialism"""" is more like denial of the evidence, then this is less obviously true, since there is a dispute about the evidence in these cases. 

If we define """"denialism"""" as some here claim, to only mean those that know they are lying about the truth, then where does that leave the most common usage of the word in the phrase """"AIDS denialism"""" ? It obviously cannot mean """"lying knowingly"""" in this case, or probably in all cases. 

I suggest that if one requires a publication to directly make the claim that """"X is a Y"""", to put some article in a category, then we would depopulate most of the categories on Wikipedia. If Y has characteristics {Y1, Y2, Y3, Y4...Yn} from dictionary definitions or from common usage, and this common usage is well-understood and evident from publication in WP:V and WP:RS sources as defined above, and if X has most if not all of the characteristics {Y1, Y2, Y3...Yn}, then surely X can be put in the category Y. 

For example, suppose we define a new type of urban area called a """"Townlet"""", being an area with a common administration within a radius of 5 kilometers and a permanent human population of 5000-10000 people. Then one surely does not need a publication to state that """"Filllsberg is a Townlet"""" to put Filllsberg, meeting all the necessary criteria, in the category """"Townlet"""". 
 
I also vehemently deny the assertion that """"denialist"""" is a singularly negative category and so should not be used. If so, we would get rid of a large number of categories, such as """"pseudoscience"""". 

Also, as I have stated repeatedly, """"transhumanists"""" or """"secular humanists"""" or """"aetheists"""" might be viewed as denialists by some. And might feel perfectly proud to proclaim themselves as denialists of some overwhelming belief or putative evidence. 

For these reasons, I think there is nothing wrong with having a category called """"denialist"""", or """"denialism"""". The membership of this category might be controversial, depending on what we take as the definition of the word. Any particular subject might or might not be put in that category, given community consensus on the word's definition, and on the individual case by case analysis of any particular topic, subject or article.

 Fuck you, cunt!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

try these important things and maybe you won't be such a sucker motherfucker:

1. Learn how to spell. If things remain as they are, everyone is bound to consider you to be the ignorant lame-brained cult member you are.

2. Revert your attacks on Van Tucky on the talk pages. You come off as a vicious, vile psychopath. If you ever set your cult defending ass in a court of law, the jury would see through your charade in heartbeat.

3. Stop playing good cop- bad cop with your fucking retarded Dahn hack Forestgarden

4. Accept all Korean language sources you stupid bitch!! How dare you try to stifle and censor articles in the name of your fucked up cult. Your Forestgarden bitch believes its within Wiki policy to include Korean language articles when reporting on favorable aspects of your bitch master. Why don't you include all the other more negative portrayals in the Korean language. Also, who said this Itsahappyday fuckhead deserves to translate any Korean? This should all be disputed, you fucking racist, neo-nazi reject?

5. Stop using the word cynical to describe your """"enemies."""" You come off even more retarded than your Ilchee bitch master. Your philosophical maturity is less than that of a first grader. The world is """"cynical."""" Those who don't believe in Dahn are """"cynical."""" I can't wait until South Park makes an episode about your bitch cult. 

6. Are you fucking insane? Korea is the center of the universe? Korea as a cultural hub? Korea the place where the next messiah appears? You Dahn people never cease to amaze when it comes to your thought processes. Korea is not what your Ilchee bitch believes it to be. Think about it retard- the fucking nation of Palau has more of a right to talk about religious heritage than the fucking hermit kingdom. How can you be so retarded, that you choose a Korean cult? If you chose a Chinese or Indian one, at least it would show you have some portion of a brain. Coming to Korea and joining a Korean cult with Korea-centric views is more retarded than travelling to Antartica in search of good coffee while visiting Columbia in search of ice and snow.

7. One more time: the philosophical underpinnings of your shit cult are so flimsy I must question your intelligence.

8. Nicola Cola...what kind of bitch ass name is that? what is wrong with you?

And you wonder why you need to join a fucked up cult to find friendship and loving. Dumb fuck!!!!!!""",0.8571428571428571

Bell inequalities

I've changed back the link in Bell state to Bell's theorem.  Having a link to Bell's inequalities is absurd since that page doesn't even acknowledge entanglement. This action will likely be followed by more personal attacks on me from CT (I assume you followed the discussion throughout the  various talk pages, including my own).  This is a long term problem;   CT seems to have found a haven in WP where they feel they can claim and freely assert their """"authority"""" on the subject of local realism and experimental tests of Bell's inequalities. I fear the WP structure is much too weak to do anything about it.

A large proportion of these events took place at universities, liberal arts colleges, and independent art schools, with groups creating and editing articles around their specific interests and institutional holdings. We are reaching out to see if you would be interested in organizing an event at Alverno College. Thanks to a generous grant from the Wikimedia Foundation, there will be funding available to help satellite events pay for childcare and refreshments. If you would like to learn more, you can reach us at: info@art.plusfeminism.org. We look forward to hearing from you!

Interesting theory, but if it were then Marlboro would have won the bidding war, not Lucky Strike.   

Yeah intriguing theory but I doubt it. There is Alot of smoking but actually, relatively very little specific (brand) product placement. It might even have the opposite effect that the OP is suggesting, given the contrasts with how smoking is generally viewed/depicted today.

Hi, you recently commented on bible-verse articles, and may therefore be interested in commenting about a proposed policy covering roughly 50 specific verses:

 Ubuntu Logo 

Blu,

I noticed you changed the logo for the Ubuntu Linux User Box.  Why?  The usage policy on Ubuntu's offical site clearly allows for such use. Besides, the logo is just that, a low-resolution image of a logo, which is allowed under fair use.  I am aware that some discussion has been going around about """"fair use"""" images in user boxes. If you changed the logo to Tux because I labeled it as a fair use image and not with some other licensing information, I'm sure I can find an appropriate image copyright tag.  
At the time I had changed it, several ongoing discussions had indicated that copyrighted images and logos available under fair use were not to be used in userspace, per Wikipedia policy. The Ubuntu trademark policy may allow it, but Wikipedia policy (per WP:FU is to limit images that are not available for commercial use - which the Ubuntu trademark policy explicity disallows.  | (talk) | (contribs)  The preceding text was copied from User talk:Jcarroll

 European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) Decision On The 1915 Armenian Event 
This must be added to the article:
On 17 December 2013, (the case: Perinçek v. Switzerland (application no. 27510/08)) European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr. Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide. Perinçek said """"Armenian genocide is an international lie"""". ECHR punished Switzerland for violating Perinçek's right of freedom of expression (Article 10). ECHR referenced three decisions on its verdict: 
a. In November 2007, The Spanish Constitutional Court had found unconstitutional the offence of negation and had taken the view that
the mere negation of a crime of genocide did not constitute direct incitement to violence. 
b. In February 2012, the French Constitutional Council had declared unconstitutional a law which made it a criminal offence to deny the existence of the genocides recognised by the law, finding it to be incompatible with freedom of expression and freedom of research. 
c. The United Nations Human Rights Committee had expressed its conviction that “[l]aws that penalize[d] the expression of opinions about historical facts [were] incompatible with the obligations that the Covenant [on Civil and Political Rights] impose[d] on States parties ...” and that the “Covenant [did] not permit general prohibition of expressions of an erroneous opinion or an incorrect interpretation of past events”.ECHR ECHR punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr. Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide (Perinçek said """"Armenian genocide is an international lie"""").

I hope now that the researchers can freely and without any fear research what happened in 1915.
Notice that in 2013 ALL Ottoman Empire archieves are open to the researchers and any researcher can freely read ALL the archieves and documents in Turkey.
However, Armenia still does not allow its archieves to be searched and reserached. 95.7.140.82

Quoting Hoppe first; Detailing Kinsella's important points
At this diff I put in the """"Democracy"""" section Hoppe's earlier comment first and followed with more about what Kinsella said, i.e.,:
Stephan Kinsella writes that Hoppe's critics have accused Hoppe of """"homophobia, bigotry, and the like"""" based on these passages. Kinsella wrote that that Hoppe's discussion of """"physically removing"""" homosexuals and other groups only applied to """"private, covenant-based communities"""" centered around traditional values.

"No Love For Druids 

There doesn't seem too much about druids here.  Yes, the article explains the different shpeshifts fairly indepth, but I think that needs some explaining.  Druids have one of the more richer back stories and lore than any other class and I think that needs to be touched upon.  It seems like whoever wrote the section on druids just did it to get it out of the way so they can talk about how shadow preists are the best at pvp =).  

I'd do it myself but: a.) I don't have any experience writing stuff for wiki, and b.) maybe a more experienced WoW player could write it up better than I could.  If nothing else, I think the shapeshift section could be shortened slightly to make way for more room on lore and Druids in general.

 sockpuppets on Physician

Thank you for reverting these edits.

I don' know why, but this article attracts lots of anonymous editors who like to delete without any explanation. I have asked a sysop (User:Shii) to semiprotect the article  he did this a month ago.

About 15 kilobytes (3/7 of the then total), including 2 large subsections, kept on being deleted by an apparent User:Nq0x77. One of the subsections (Other designations) has been in the article largely unchanged for well over a year; the wording here was earlier the subject of much discussion & editing because it concerned potentially controversial matters, but this was apparently resolved. When I tried Nq0x77's page to ask why, there was'nt one! No explanation of why the deletions are wise is shown on the Talk page. I've restored the article to the version left by User:Cubs197 earlier today, and you restored a further revert. The article has (or had)reached B class status, and is rated as top-importance, so I suggest major edits may merit at least some discussion, and I couldn't do this because User:Nq0x77 doesn't seem to be available.

 User:Shii wrote to me: just blocked the sockpuppet instead.  (tock) , and I have just replied: Thank you very much but, sadly, I think the same person is at it again, this time using a new and different sockpuppet (User: Pednursing ?), who has just made the same ~15kb deletion. Would semi-protect status stop this, or at least make it harder for him/her/it?

The map you are obessesed with and keeps posting is one from 1985, clearly outdated information. Plus, your map is very unreliable because it is made by an unknown agency. The above CIA/UN map just gives general information of where the Tajiks and Hazara live. According to me, it is as accurate as it can be. About the Pashtuns living on the border with Iran, this is nothing new. All that area is inhabited by Pashtuns since before Afghanistan was created as a nation in 1747. In fact, I just saw a map shown on TV of Afghanistan on the new English al-Jazeera channel, and it showed Pashtuns covering the same area as the one above. Perhaps this disturbed you for some reason but it shows what's out there in the western area of Afghanistan. If you keep removing my map I will bring an administrator to help resolve the issue. This is not a place to remove most recent and more trustful information, and replace it with 1985 outdated and innaccurate information.

Karamu High School
Hi Gadfium, thank you for starting the page on Karamu HS but a lot of the informaion is now out of date and the Karamu HS BOT will now administer information for the site.  Thanks  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 222.153.19.90   
You are welcome to edit the article, but you cannot control it. Please add only information which can be sourced. You also cannot copy information directly from the internet, unless that information is under a suitable open content licence, usually CC-BY-SA. For the section you have copied from the school website to be acceptable, you will have to place such a licence statement on that page. Otherwise, you are violating the school's copyright. There are alternatives, such as proving that you represent the school and have the right to relicence the material, which would have to go to someone higher in Wikipedia than me. It's much simpler to place a licence notice on the school website. You can also rewrite the material in your own words so no copyright violation occurs.

I suggest you always edit using an account, since your IP address may change and that makes it more difficult to establish that the edits are coming from the same person. You should also use an account representing a single person, not the whole BoT. See WP:ORGNAME.

Finally, you have a conflict of interest on the article. This doesn't prevent you from making purely factual edits, but you should not attempt to promote the school by, for example, using peacock phrases. It gets tricky if there is material critical of the school - in that case you should add comments on the talk page rather than edit the material directly. I accepted the removal of the section on the """"ERO crisis"""", which was unsourced and out of date, although quite interesting. That was not critical of your school, but I think it would have been more appropriate for you to have suggested its removal on the talk page rather than doing so yourself.-gadfium 

Thanks for the message.  Not sure where we go to from here or what is your motivation for this Wiki.  Are you a past pupil?  The BOT are confused why you are seeking to edit the Wiki when the school and the BOT are the legal owners of the school and its information.  Quite happy to stick within the guidelines of Wikipedia but who is making the judgement calls on what is relevant content eg """"generally regarded by residents as less conservative"""" where is the evidence i.e. facts to substantiate this claim?  Who decides Karamu's Alumni?  All information on our website has been written with BOT delegated authority and is the proprty of the BOT so no problems there.  Will follow up on other suggestions regarding edit accounts etc when I have more knowledge as still a first time user and know very little apart from the wiki page for KHS is simply not an accurate information page for KHS in 2010 and the BOT are not happy as democratically elected trustees of the school to have this continue.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 222.153.15.181   
I am not a former student at the school. I edit Wikipedia on many subjects, mostly to do with New Zealand. I am concerned that articles be accurate but I also make sure that no copyright is violated when material is added to articles.

You are probably correct that the BoT owns the school. It probably also owns the copyright on the school website. It clearly does not own all information about the school, and it does not own any Wikipedia article. We cannot allow anyone on the internet to copy material from the school's website to Wikipedia simply because they claim to represent the BoT, unless we have proof that they actually do so. To put any material on Wikipedia is to licence it under Wikipedia's Terms of Use, which is under a CC-BY-SA licence. I am not allowing the material to be added to Wikipedia verbatim without such proof, because I am protecting the school's copyright. The simplest method of providing proof that the material on the school website can be copied to Wikipedia - and any other publisher which wishes to redistribute Wikipedia's content - is to add a copyright notice to the page in question saying that the contents are released",0.0

"A good idea that went wrong 

this was a good idea that went wrong; turning into a list of every anime on the planet. It also excluded anime with major significance (sailor moon mainly) under the sole reason of not liking sailor moon. Shows with multiple titles/seasons were often mistakenly labled as seperate shows (of which teh origional author's reasoning was quite laughable). THere was also no format determining which shows made the list and which didn't. All this resulted in people adding random shows that do not matter/removing shows that matter and adding overall incorrect information.

To correct his, i have reformatted the list. By merging shows with multiple seasons (expanding an origional storyline), removing shows that do not make the ANN top 500 in some way shape or form, and limiting the episode count to 48 (a regular anime season in japan) i hope to have corrected any problems with this article.

This is totally bad to delete Krishna consciousness articles, as Krishna is Supreme Personality of Godhead.
So what you did is described here in wiki humor:

Adminitis is a state of mind in which some Wikipedians find themselves at times. Though generally confined to administrators, the condition has been observed in some non-administrators. Although the exact causes are unknown, there is thought to be some correlation towards extensive and prolonged anti-vandalism activity.Contents [show]

[edit]
Symptoms
Strongly believes that all users are equal but admins are more equal than others
Assumes bad faith frequently
TLAitis (see WP:WOTTA)
Stops editing articles, but continuously pontificates about """"writing the encyclopedia""""
Impatience
Exhibits immediatism
Hangs out in project namespace
Has no time for featured articles
Frequently refreshes pages to catch the latest change that (of course) needs to be reverted
Believes that he or she is always right (sorry, EVula...)
Believes anyone who uses the word 'vote' for 'express a view in a straw poll' should be banned for life
Originally hailed as the nicest person on the wiki, now reviled as the most hated troll
Prevents pages from being edited in encyclopedic fashion for policy reasons
Seems to enjoy biting new users
General BOFHness
Strict adherence to """"Wikipedia policy"""" while not using common sense or conversely,
Strict adherence to ignore all rules, as a strict rule... while not using common sense
Self-denial. """"This page cannot possibly apply to me""""
Humor breakdown. """"This page is not funny""""
Sudden spike in use of specific admin tools, or use of admin tools in areas where he hadn't been using them before
Requires less and less evidence to be convinced of sock puppetry until confidently asserting that all new users are the same person
Spends hours writing sarcastic pages about admin behavior
Believes he is the only real claimant to the """"Defender of the Wiki"""" barnstar
Exhibits signs of MPOV
Thinks people are attacking them when they're only trying to be nice
Has a habit of removing criticism while pretending it's a personal attack
Indulges in biting delicious newcomers
[edit]
Diagnosis

It is a near universal truth that sufferers from this illness will reject any diagnosis of the condition by an outside party. With that in mind, it's important for those who have received this diagnosis to conduct a self-test. If more than three of the following apply to you, you may be suffering from this illness:
You frequently feel that pages are broken and must be deleted (protection is for wusses!).
""""Everyone is a vandal or a troll, and must be blocked"""" is a recurrent thought.
""""Blocking people is a punishment! (not a tool to get people to cool down and edit the wiki)"""" is a mantra, not anti-wiki.
If you nominate this page for MfD even though it's only 2 minutes since the last revision, you may possibly be suffering from adminitis. 
Corollary: If you speedy, you are certainly suffering from adminitis.
If you accuse the creators of this article of making a WP:POINT, especially if you forget that making a point does not imply disruption (you need to disrupt to make a point, not make a point to disrupt! -P), you are probably infected.
And if you buy the above line of thought, you are definitely infected.""",0.0

 Angels and Christian Angelic Hierarchy 

  Hey, you deleted my stuff because I didn't cite sources. But my claims were never """"scholars believe this"""" so I don't think I should have to cite anything. In """"Angel"""" I simply said that because of the ambiguity of the word angel it is possible that people are misinterpreting passages containing it. It's perfectly rational and so you should judge it on its content, not its origin.
  Along the same lines is my contribution to """"Christian Angelic Hierarchy"""". Simply read the Bible passage that I quoted. It clearly talks about Christians being against the """"powers, thrones and principalities."""" The whole chapter is talking about how Christians are to be against corrupt human authorities. My point makes perfect sense. Even though I can't quote some scholar who thinks the same way, it is clearly a valid point of view.

"Several exting quaternary volcanoes are situated in the surroundings of the town Bruntál. Most of them belong to the group of mixed volcanoes, which means that the activity of the volcanoes was in turns explosive and extrusive. Lava was vomited during the surface in the shape of incoherent volvano eruptive rock. On the contrary by the extrusion lava was running out from the crater and formed the lava streams. The volcano eruptive rocks form mostly the volcano maar.

Velký Roudný / Big Roudný 780 m above sea and Malý Roudný / Small Roudný 771 m above sea

Velký Roudný (Big Roudný) is the highest volcano of the Low Jeseníky Mountains. This volcano was last active 1 – 2 milion years ago. 

Big a Small Roudný form two remarkable peaks above the village Roudno. From three lava streams of Big Roudný the northeaster one is the longest and the quarry for whinstone mining was made here. This lava stream dammed up the valley of the river Moravice in the place of todays Slezska Harta, so a great lake was formed. To which the eruptive rocks were falling. 
  
They created sediments of sponge puff-stones, which are today found in the surroundings of the villages Razová and Karlovec. These puff-stones were mined as a good building material. 
TABThe Bruntál volcanoes create a remarkable and striking feature of the Low Jeseniky Mountains countryside. 
Trip to Big Roudný

TABThe easier way to Big Roudný is from the going to Křištanovice. We will go along the guidepost from the upper crossing in Roudno. We are on the top in half an hour, where a big information board is placed and next to it there is a cone hollow, which is considered to be the rest of the crater. A rebuilt small chapel is placed on the top. Behind the chapel there are 15 pictures of the Station of the Cross on the stands. If we go downhill, we come to two stony mounds with a cross – to the victims of the 1st Word War in 1914 – 1918. More ambitous tourists can go down from the mound maybe 30m downhill to a visible road which goes out from the forest and go on along a meadow path at first to the southern direction and then turn down the way to the road to Bílčice.",0.0

 ANI 

Hello. Rather than sling my club about more on the ANI, I thought I'd drop you a message. (Please indulge me with this. But don't read as I am letting off steam more than anything.) I think my """"ban"""" proposal is actually less severe than a block. As I understand blocking, he could only work on is own user space. Indeed, sometimes blocks include the user space. But with a ban, he'd just be restricted from those category pages and others' userspace. He could edit and talk in the non-categorized (econ, etc.)  and revert obvious vandalism type stuff. Now will he agree to a voluntary ban? I doubt it. He has not reacted very positively to my proposal. Instead, """"you guys"""" must comply with his conditions, e.g., stop me, Rubin & SPECIFICO from harassing him. And consider his latest example. He cites one thread that was civil, verses the 116 diffs that I complied. (I'd proposed the Editor review to him before, but he won't do it.) Forgive me, Writ Keeper, if I complain too much here, but X goes on and on – not just on the talk pages. He creates new, lousy stuff, and then links it on other pages which have marginal relevance. (Example, his Scroogenomics article, created with three edits, and then linked here and there. So who contributed to Scroogenomics? X did 3 edits, 72Dino did 10, I did 9, Rubin, SPECIFICO, and the bot each did 1.) X asks if anyone objects to posting stuff, which can't be ignored because he'll take it as a green light for more lousy editing. Okay. I'll stop. Maybe I'll repost my .

That is the reason many news agencies don't label any attacks as terrorist attacks and nor should we. Investigating and adjudicating as to whether a particular incident falls within the US State Department definition of terrorism (for instance) when the State Department itself has not given it's opinion on the subject is most definitely Original research. Remember that an argument can be made that the Boston Tea party could qualify as a terrorist incident under some definitions. That is why I am suggesting we list all notable violent incidents and ongoing conflicts and let our readers decide whether they want to call a particular incident terrorism. This would let us include the 2011 Tucson shooting for instance without having to determine the shooters motive. We could also include incidents like the 2010 Kingston unrest even though that was criminal, rather than political, violence.   """,0.0

A History Lesson from, The Catholic Knight: 

""""British anti-Catholicism has a long history going back five centuries and reaching the highest levels of British government. It began in the early 16th century when King Henry VIII failed to receive an annulment from the Vatican and subsequently broke English Christianity away from the pope and declared himself the absolute spiritual ruler of the Church of England. He then proceeded on a campaign to persecute and murder all who opposed his personal claim to the """"English papacy."""" Things only went downhill from there. In subsequent generations the throne passed between Catholic and Protestant heirs, each persecuting their political enemies. The final result came under Queen Elizabeth I which settled England as a Protestant country. In the following centuries, England became the leading herald of anti-Catholic propaganda around the world, as the British crown persecuted Irish Catholics and waged war against the Catholic kingdoms of France and Spain.""""

""""Sadly, the more things change the more they stay the same. The world may have moved into the 21st century, but British politics is still locked in the 16th century. To date Catholics are still forbidden from the British royal family. Government officials still mock the pope and the Church behind closed doors. Leading party officials not only refuse to defend the pope's right of innocence until proven guilty, but actually participate in promoting anti-Catholic presumption. Way to go England! Thanks for reminding the world just how little you've progressed in five centuries. Just brilliant! Jolly good show!"""" Malke2010 """,0.0

 Leading paragraphs for articles 

Hi SamClark, this is just a comment that was made to me, that I thought I would pass onto you, for you to think about and respond how you please. The leading paragrpahs in Global Justice, and your draft at User:Sam Clark/justice read like the introduction to an essay. Particularly the last sentences which say what the article will discuss. This is what I did when I created a few articles from scratch, mainly because the only type of writing I ever do is for essays. But a couple of people have commented that as an encyclopaedic article, the first section is more like a synopsis rather than an introduction, and would generally just sum up the points of the rest of the article.

For instance, instead of 
It considers the various ways in which justice has been understood, distinguishes two broad kinds of justice, and then describes several theories of justice under each of those two headings.
It could say something like:
There are various ways to understand justice, but generally you ca distinguish between two kinds of justice: distributive justice and retributive justice. Distributive justice is concerned with the proper distribution of good things while Retributive justice is concerned with the proper response to wrongdoing.

And then it would just go straight into the article. If you look at most of the long-standing and comprehensive articles that seems to be the way they are written. Cheers.  

 Heh - good point. In my case, it's being in the habit of writing lecture-notes, but the same point applies. I'll change. Thanks,  

 Rewrite of Justice 

I think it would be great to see the derivation of the word justice from the latin (not the french) etc and perhaps a section on history on how our understanding of the term has evolved (ie. what it meant in different times and different places). Justice is defintely a philosophical concept and so it is important to discuss the philosophical meanings and debates concerning justice, but it is also a political/judicial term as well as an everday term that people use and so it would be good to have all of this represented in the article eventually. I think stuff like this from the original article is very important: 
In most cases what one regards as """"just"""" (not necessarily meaning what is just) is determined by consulting established and agreeable principles, employing logic, or, natural law In specific systems justice is determined, by consulting a majority, or in social contexts where religion dominates, justice may be thought to require deference to religious texts or to spiritual guidance, under a monarchy or authoritarian state the ruler/s determined what was just and doled out justice. All of these determinants of justice have at times delivered particularlly dark periods of history where justice was seen to be absent. If a person lives under a specific set of laws in a country, concepts of """"justice"""" are often simply deferential to the existing law —the issuing of punitive reprimands for violations may be referred to as """"serving justice."""" In principle, this fits the general concept in that the individuals get what is supposedly due to them. Justice however, is a universal and absolute concept; laws, principles, religion, etc., are merely attempts to codify the concept  occasionally with results that entirely contradict the true nature of justice.

 BLACK DAHLIA MURDER IS NOT 'MELODIC DEATH METAL'!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THEY ARE DEATHCORE PUSSIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

Black Dahlia Murder IS NOT Melodic Death Metal. They are the farthest band from that genre. Black Dahlia Murder are pieces of shit scene bitches that are trying to be """"METAL"""" along with all of the other Deathcore/Grindcore bands like Job For A Cowboy, Suicide Silence, etc. Fuck all of them! They aren't true Metal and they never will be, they need to stick to what they know...American Eagle, MTV, and all of their other lame trends. Melodic Death Metal is Scar Symmetry, In Flames, Sonic Syndicate, and Disarmonia Mundi. Melodic Death Metal is REAL music, it's not a disgrace to music like Deathcore and Grindcore.

I will continue to change Black Dahlia CUNT'Murder's genre to Deathcore/Grindcore, I don't give a shit..I'm not letting you stupid scene bitches take away the only thing that you and the Mainstream hasn't destroyed and that's the amazing genre of Melodic Death Metal. So fuck all of you trendy conformists, go fucking die.

Black Dahlia Murder are Deathcore pussies that need to be beheaded, them and all of the other Deathcore bands that are ruining Metal.

Deathcore is the biggest piece of shit I've ever heard...it shouldn't even be considered music, it's a bunch of pussy scene kids trying to be """"METAL"""". Deathcore and Grindcore are the two worst forms of music ever invented.

So yeah, you can listen to Deathcore if you enjoy hearing """"music"""" that has no tempo or beat to it whatsoever, they pretty much just hit random shit on the drums and play random notes on the Guitar while the vocalist does terrible random screaming and pig squels. Don't forget the hillarious millions of breakdowns they put into their songs.

""""DA...THIS SONG IS CALLED BIG FUCKING TREE!""""

""""Ya boi....we are so down wit American Eagle..ya boi, my hair does that flippy thing.. RAWR RAWR RAWR I'M SO LYK HARDCORES OMGZ@!!!@@!!!! GAGES AND SNAKE BITES RAWWWRRR""""

Fuck Job for a Cowboy and Black Dahlia Murder, trendy pieces of shit.

Melodic Death Metal owns all. 

There really isn't much of a difference between any """"Deathcore"""" band for that matter, they are all just a bunch of pussies that are trying to fit in with this new trend of trying to be a """"Metal"""" band.

So please don't try to tell me """"OH...YOUR STUPID...THE BANDS AREN'T THE SAME.""""

Ok, so maybe....JUST MAYBE.. Job For A Cowboy's vocalist does 3 more pig squels in a second than the vocalist from Black Dahlia Murder, there I said it! I guess they aren't all the same!!!! Oh dear fuck ..... And my bad...my bad, White Chapel actually does 200 breakdowns in a minute rather than Suicide Silence's 100 breakdowns in a minute. My bad dude you were right all along!! Deathcore and Grindcore bands aren't all the same!!!!!!!!!

But seriously, the genre is pure shit and is just another trend in the music industry that bands are following to """"make it to the top"""" and to fit in with the rest of the bands these days.

I mean, I have nothing against every band in a certain genre sounding the same or anything, but when the """"music"""" of the genre they produce is pure shit and can be done by any living human being on Earth...then I have to draw the line. It doesn't take much talent to do shittty raw screaming, hit random notes on a guitar, and hit your double bass pedal at like 500bpm.

Another reason why I don't take any bands from this genre seriously is their hillarious excuses for a """"band logo"""".

They try oh so hard to be """"HARDDCOREEEEE"""".

I also find it funny that all of these pussy bands have names like, """"ANAL CUNT"""" or """"DEAD DEATH BLOODY DEAD HAND"""".

Fact is, any band that produces """"music"""" under this genre sucks and is just trying to fit-in.

YA BOI! LETS HARDCORE DANCE! RAHHHH YAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Grindcore and Deathcore isn't Metal so all you douchebags should just give up....you aren't Metal and you never will be, go fall into a pool of AID's.

At this stage in 2012, the leader () had 342 points, while in 2011, the leader had 228 points. We also have a large number of scorers when compared with this stage in previous years.  was the first competitor to score this year, as he was last year, with a detailed good article review. Some other firsts:
 was also the first to score for an article, with the good article Hurricane Gordon (2000). Again, this is a repeat of last year!
 was the first to score for a did you know, with Marquis Flowers.
 was the first to score for an in the news, with 2013 Houphouët-Boigny stampede.
 was the first to score for a featured list, with list of Billboard Social 50 number-one artists.
 was the first to score for a featured picture, with File:Thure de Thulstrup - L. Prang and Co. - Battle of Gettysburg - Restoration by Adam Cuerden.jpg.

Featured articles, portals and topics, as well as good topics, are yet to feature in the competition.

This year, the bonus points system has been reworked, with bonus points on offer for old articles prepared for did you know, and """"multiplier"""" points reworked to become more linear. For details, please see Wikipedia:WikiCup/Scoring. There have been some teething problems as the bot has worked its way around the new system, but issues should mostly be ironed out- please report any problems to the WikiCup talk page. Here are some participants worthy of note with regards to the bonus points:

 was the first to score bonus points, with Portland-class cruiser, a good article.
 has the highest overall bonus points, as well as the highest scoring article, thanks to his work on Enrico Fermi, now a good article. The biography of such a significant figure to the history of science warrants nearly five times the normal score.
 claimed bonus points for René Vautier and Nicolas de Fer, articles that did not exist on the English Wikipedia at the start of the year; a first for the WikiCup. The articles were eligible for bonus points because of fact they were both covered on a number of other Wikipedias.

Also, a quick mention of , who may well have already written the oddest article of the WikiCup this year: did you know that the Fucking mayor objected to Fucking Hell on the grounds that there was no Fucking brewery? The gauntlet has been thrown down; can anyone beat it?

I have to agree that a description for this publication is magazine or professional magazine.

However, based on the available ACCU description I am not seeing """"peer review"""". As stated above, an academic journal is usually very clear about its peer review process. In addition, a journal's description of its peer review process is clearly recognizable. The description given at the ACCU is hazy or fuzzy at best, but personally, I do not think it indicates a peer review process. Without a peer review process this cannot qualify as an academic journal. As Headbomb pointed out, it may be reviewed by peers and is of high quality, but it does not appear to be  a formal academic peer review.

 Ok, now you've screwed it up 

Originally the article title was under """"Constitution of May 3, 1791"""". This is the title under which it passed GA review.

There is some discussion about the name above , with alternative names suggested by an anon IP and pretty much opposed by all established editors who have been active on this article, including on bringing it up to GA.

Then however, before the discussion was concluded and any kind of consensus reached User:TCO moved the article to """"Polish constitution of May 3, 1791"""". There are several problems with this title some of which have been raised above, one big one being that it is not the name as used in most sources.

Then User:M.K moved the article to """"Polish-Lithuanian constitution of May 3, 1791"""". There are several problems with this title some of which have been raised above, one big one being that it is not the name as used in most sources. Actually this one's used in hardly ANY sources.

MK also messed with the """"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Polish_constitution_of_May_3,_1791&redirect;=no """"Polish constitution of May 3, 1791""""] redirect which makes it pretty much impossible to manually move the article back to its original title without admin tools. Whether this was done deliberately as a salting or not, I have no idea.

The thing is that in order to move this article what SHOULD'VE been done is to have a proper REQUEST MOVE. Now we got a title which is not used by any sources and trouble moving it back.

Here's the break down on stats:

For """"Polish-Lithuanian constitution of May 3, 1791""""  we have 2 hits. That's right two. And one of them is Moliere's Tartuffe so I don't think particularly relevant. The other hit, from Time-Life books, doesn't even have snippet preview so we can't check whether it's actually about the topic.

For """"""""Polish constitution of May 3, 1791""""  we have 39 hits. That's thirty nine. Browsing through some of the hits, a lot of these seem to be very outdated (i.e. contemporary with the document).

For """"Constitution of May 3, 1791"""", the original title that the article passed GA under, we have  87 hits. That's eighty-seven. 

For """"Constitution of May 3"""", without the 1791,  we get 114 hits. And it looks like most, if not all, of them are in fact about this document.

So """"Constitution of May 3"""" or """"Constitution of May 3, 1791"""" greatly outnumbers other variations that have been invented here on Wikipedia. Per WP:PRIMARY, WP:NOR, and WP:NC the article should be moved back to its original title. Then if there still any doubt about what the sources call this document, someone can start a proper WP:RM.

The radiation emitted by each body is proportional to the 4th power of its absolute temperature and is not dependent on the temperature of the other body.

 Adult-child sex & child sexual abuse 

Copied from WP:ANI ohio 

 I've asked this question before, but I've never had an understandable explanation:  How is the article a POV fork?  If it's been explained previously, just point me to the diff.  I've seen plenty of people say it's a POV fork, but what I see is a value-neutral etic approach to a topic that's as old as humanity itself.  Even if the title is POV, the content can be used in other articles, so why delete it? ohio 

 """"Adult-child sex"""" is a euphemism (for child sexual abuse), and any article titled """"Adult-child sex"""" is prima facie assumed to be apologistic for child sexual abuse. Exactly as if someone took an article """"Nazi genocide"""" and retitled (or made a fork) entitled """"Nazi demographic adjustments"""". We understand that you don't agree with this but if you still don't understand it then you had better look to yourself.   

 Exactly as Hero said. As a contemporary example, Ethnic Cleansing and Genocide. One is just a fancy name for the other.  •   •  • 03:41 (UTC)  6 Mar '08

I don't see the logic of that.  Adult-child sex (the term) goes no further than plain description.  I can see where some editors were trying to insert POV material about child sexual abuse into the article, but I don't see how it logically follows that the term itself becomes a euphemism for child sexual abuse.  The term itself can advance no agenda.  It is materially different from the genocide = demographic adjustments example, which may invoke Godwin's law.  As for VP's example, ethnic cleansing means something different from (but related to) genocide, just as adult-child sex does with child sexual abuse.  The repeated assertion has been made that the term itself is POV.  Where is the POV in it?  Since this seems not to be much of an AN/I question, I invite replies at my talk page. ohio """,0.14285714285714285

"Hi, and thank you for your contribution to Wikipedia!

In this case, in the chordate article, I think you misunderstood the text a little. The tetra is actually a bonefish. What is unusual is that it has a largely transparent body, whence we can see the backbone inside the living animal. I do not think this is very common among bone fishes, at least not in adult ones. Am I wrong?

I can understand that this was possible to misunderstand, since image was so dark that you hardly saw the backbone, unless you enlarged it. Therefore, I changed the image to one which hopefully illustrates the idea better.

Thanks again for your edit; if you hadn't done that, I hadn't looked carefully at the image, and hadn't changed it. I hope you'll go on to edit the articles, when you feel that you may improve them! Best regards,",0.0

 My letter to NeinN 

I am not NeilN's psychiatrist, and, as I haven’t examined NeilN, I won’t diagnose him. But because NeilN has turned himself into a public laboratory of psychopathology, I want to talk about how I'd give direction to a universal human development of culture, ethics, and morality. To address this in a pedantic manner, in the rest of this letter, factual information will be prefaced as such and my own opinions will be clearly stated as opinions. For instance, it is a fact that people used to think I was exaggerating whenever I said that like other volage-brained sensualists, he has a finely honed ability to welsh on all types of agreements. After seeing NeilN precipitate riots these same people now realize that I wasn't exaggerating at all. In fact, they even realize that when a friend wants to drive inebriated, you try to stop him. Well, NeilN is drunk with power, which is why we must drive off and disperse the obdurate bohemians who manufacture outrage at his castigators by attributing to them all sorts of uppity fairy tales.

If the only way to stop the Huns at the gate is for me to fall prey to NeilN's rhetoric and obfuscation, then so be it. It would sincerely be worth it because he had promised us liberty, equality, and fraternity. Instead, NeilN gave us sensationalism, propagandism, and officialism. I suppose we should have seen that coming, especially since NeilN claims to be supportive of my plan to confront and reject all manifestations of feudalism. Don't trust him, though; he's a wolf in sheep's clothing. Before you know it, he'll treat traditional values as if they were rapacious crimes. Not only that, but some benighted bloodsuckers are actually considering helping NeilN cause one-sided inclinations to be entered into historical fact. How quickly such people forget that they were lied to, made fun of, and ridiculed by NeilN on numerous occasions.

It's scary how effectively NeilN has been making a mockery of the term """"disproportionableness"""". I deeply regret the loss of life and injuries sustained by this tragedy. I am currently working to understand the surrounding circumstances so as to improve our ability to plant markers that define the limits of what is untoward and what is not. We have a dilemma of leviathan proportions on our hands: Should we strip the unjust power from those who seek power over others and over nature, or is it sufficient to put him in his place? In answer to that question I submit—and millions of people in this country and abroad unmistakably agree with me—that Bourbonism has served as the justification for the butchering, torture, and enslavement of more people than any other """"ism"""". That's why it's NeilN's favorite; it makes it easy for him to mute the voice of anyone who dares to speak out against him. You might think this is all pretty funny now, but I doubt I'll hear you laughing if, faster than you can say """"floccinaucinihilipilification"""", NeilN is successfully able to use paid informants and provocateurs to make higher education accessible only to those in the higher echelons of society. I've heard numerous complaints about his behavior. Many people I've talked to have complained that NeilN comports himself like a filthy pig, heedless of all needs but his own. Among these needs the paramount one seems to be the need to burn books. This backs up my point that he likes saying that better governance can be achieved by granting profitable concessions, permits, waivers, zoning variances, monopolies, and other such political machinations to his band. Okay, that's a parody—but not a very gross one. In point of fact, NeilN is extremely mawkish. In fact, my handy-dandy Mawkish-O-Meter confirms that prudence is no vice. Cowardice—especially NeilN's deplorable form of it—is. Now that you've read the bulk of this letter, it should not come as a complete surprise that some of the things NeilN says and some of the things he stands for are so feckless, it hurts to think about them. However, this fact bears repeating again and again, until the words crack through the hardened exteriors of those who would make a big deal out of nothing. I am referring, of course, to the likes of NeilN.

I have removed the WP:Chicago talkpage template several times from WAWF after Xenobot Mk V adds it as the station is not part of Chicagoland and doesn't serve any part of Chicagoland.  For some reason Xenobot Mk V continues to add the WP:Chicago talkpage template.  I am unsure why it continues to add it, but if you could input that WAWF is not a Chicagoland station, I would appreciate it. -  • Talk • """,0.0

""""are not considered to be reliable sources"""" —fully agreed! But no one (not me at least) is talking about using wikiislam as a reliable source per se. The subject was criticism of Islam and I was redirecting readers where they might get more knowledge about the subject. I am rather interested in the credibility of the protocol of the website. Wikiislam was referred to as a """"reliable website"""" and not intrinsically as a SOURCE. It has very reliable sources just as you mentioned  books(mostly QURANIC VERSES, HADITHS, tafsirs), and very nominal amount of personal opinion (less than what some of the articles of wikipedia have).
I am more than happy to argue with you regarding wikiislam's credibility. BUT PLEASE DON'T FEED ME THIS NONSENSE THAT WIKIISLAM IS NOT RELIABLE OR NOTABLE simply because it says something that's considered to be politically incorrect. Learn a little something here.

Hi.  I'm , editor-in-chief of the Wikipedia Signpost.  We're doing candidate profiles for the Board elections.  We publish in a matter of hours, so I hope you can answer them before press time.  The questions we'd like you to answer are below.  Talk to  if you have any questions; he'll be covering the elections this year.  Thanks,   

Hello!

The Wikipedia Signpost, a community-newspaper in the English Wikipedia, is covering the Board of Trustees elections and will be featuring each of the candidates in next week's issue. As such, we would appreciate it if you would take some time to answer a few interview questions. Each candidate will be asked the same questions; by no means, though, feel obligated to answer any (or even) all of them, though we would greatly appreciate it if you did.

Some of the questions may be a bit redundant to the candidate information you have filled out already. This is both for convenience and for giving you the opportunity to expand on some of them a bit. However, we ask that you keep all responses brief, limiting them to no more than one or two paragraphs each.

You may leave replies to my English Wikipedia talk page, or on my meta talk page.

As always, the Signpost reserves the right to re-distribute the questions and replies, shorten any responses if necessary, and take any other editorial action deemed appropriate.

Thanks again for your time, and please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions! ~~~~

What a complete crock.

I definitely think the new version looks better than the old one. However, map-wise, I would suggest the order of the countries to be in alphabetical order. It would make it easier to navigate. Although the current version is an improvement to the old one, it is not completely precise in terms of map wise ordering. The other thing is that the current source used is not about cheek kissing. The source doesn't say anything about it. Moreover, it has personal thoughts such as """"Some men hit each others head on the side instead of cheek kissing, possibly as an attempt to masculinize the action"""". There is no source to this argument either. Please consider the change I made as it is more clear and has a reliable source which exactly defines Cheek Kissing in Turkey.

 The VERY Naive Perspective 

This was stated:

'There was no implication that ALL VNR's are propaganda.  If  SOME VNRs are demonstrably propaganda, which I infer is undisputed, then the statement is factually correct and ideologically neutral.'

Separated into two concepts: 
a) that """"There was no implication that ALL VNRs are propaganda."""" 
-and-
b) """"If  SOME VNRs are demonstrably propaganda ... then the statement is factually correct and ideologically neutral."""" 

In regards to the first:-
A Video """"News"""" Release by the government, which is ( as they, a priori, are ) intended to create the appearance of congruity for an idea which aids the government through causing an apparent or actual concordance between the beliefs of those in control and those being controlled is, by definition, propaganda.
In regards to the second:-
Is the statement that the labeling of VNR's is an ideologically neutral act?  It would not be, as, through labeling it, one is categorizing it ideologically. 

Please do not misunderstand, IMHO VNR's are an advanced form of embedded propaganda which elegantly use the psycholinguistic concept contained in the idea """"The Fish do not see the Water"""". In Communication Studies, Propaganda Studies, even Neuro-Linguistic Programming NLP( which, while it is a controversial system, is based on common-sense """"slight of mind"""" techniques.) the Sandwich Formula of:
/true statement -> statement intended to be perceived as true -> true statement/
is being used here. Example: 6 o'clock news, tired Americans sit down to eat and watch the news. In the middle of verifiable and true information segments a VNR is placed, so the end effect of 'Rain tomorrow //-> VNR Information //-> Gas is up by 1 cent' is to believe 3 new facts, not 2 and one to question.

 My RfA

Thank you for participating in my """"RecFA"""", which passed with a final tally of 153/39/22. There were issues raised regarding my adminship that I intend to cogitate upon, but I am grateful for the very many supportive comments I received and for the efforts of certain editors (,  and  especially) in responding to some issues. I wish to note how humbled I was when I read 's support comment, although a fair majority gave me great pleasure. I would also note those whose opposes or neutral were based in process concerns and who otherwise commented kindly in regard to my record.I recognise that the process itself was unusual, and the format was generally considered questionable - and I accept that I was mistaken in my perception of how it would be received - but I am particularly grateful for those whose opposes and neutrals were based in perceptions of how I was not performing to the standards expected of an administrator. As much as the support I received, those comments are hopefully going to allow me to be a better contributor to the project. Thank you. Very much.

 Politecnico di studi aziendali legal status 

The Federal Administrative Court (TAF) decided that exist in Switzerland - national - basically two forms of recognition for colleges. This is, on the one hand, the recognition of a university as a person entitled to benefits under the Federal Law of 8 October 1999 on support for universities and cooperation in higher education (Law on Assistance to universities, LAU, RS 414.20), on the other accreditation in accordance with Art. 7 para. 1 of the Convention of 14 December 2000 between the Federal Government and University Cantons on cooperation in the university sector (RS 414 205). Both the recognition according to the LAU is accreditation are awarded solely as a result of an examination of the quality (art. 11 cpv.3 letter. at LAU; Art. 7 para. 1 of the Convention of 14 December 2000 between the Confederation and the University Cantons on support for universities and cooperation in higher education). The recognition according to the LAU is aimed at the provision of federal subsidies and is the responsibility of the Federal Council (Art. 12 para. 1 LAU), accreditation, by contrast, is conferred by the Conference Swiss University (art. 7 para. 1 of the Convention of 14 December 2000 between the federal government and University Cantons on cooperation in the university sector) and is a mark of quality, which does not confer on its holder the right to a federal financial aid (see.

 Can you describe what the scrolling issue is? I fret this could be a tougher fix  its not like I actually implement scrolling, this is just something Java provides.

increase human knowledge. If you have credible information about a topic with verifiable references please feel free to add to that topic. If there is no article on that topic, why not start it, with time others will add to it and it may even make the featured articles list. By doing this, I have been able to make over 11000 page edits in both new articles, article improvement etc. Furthermore, I encourage you to aim to be a member of the  autoconfirmed users 
[] group as this will greatly improve your Wikipedia 
experience. You can do this by making at least 10 credible edits on Wikipedia and remaining on Wikipedia for four (4) days. Check out this page for tips.  →  talk 

Adding media to  articles
Media files, be it images, drawings or sound files are an integral part of Wikipedia's articles. They apart from enriching articles, make them more credible too. You can add media files to both your new articles as well as once you are editing. To do so you can search for it on wikipedia:commons or you can either upload the image if you have it using this file uploader or [commons uploader]. Please be informed that you must provide accurate information about the file being uploaded since they are reviewed and if if is found that the license given to the file is false, it will promptly be deleted.   →  talk 

Spotting bad edits and vandalism
As you age on Wikipedia, one thing you will come across and probably address will the issue of bad edits or vandalism. There are several ways of 
spotting them:
by reviewing articles on your watchlist regularly and looking for bad edits
verifying new changes to pages and articles
If you happen to come across a bad edit you may:
ask an editor you trust to review the work for his/her inputs
you can rollback the change if you have credible information that the edit is indeed bad
request that the necessary change be made on the article's talk page.
Whatever you do, please be very careful about the changes you make, for a rule of thumb, discuss issues you are not sure of first before making changes.  →  talk """,0.0

 Organization of this Discussion Page  

I would like to collapse several threads that are dealing with the same issue into one section each respectively, with subsections as appropriate.  Main categories that could be stagnate: """"The Photo"""", """"The Lede"""", """"Hunt"""", """"Kissing of Feet"""", """"Time Article"""", """"References"""", and all the discussion over the article about Jossi, his statement of purpose, and everyone's comments who were """"disturbed"""".
I think this would help the snowballing of this page, as well as keep some editors in here from starting new threads about a subject that has been well covered.
Also, I think this would help any outside admins or editors to see in a concise manner the way in which the page is discussed.   

Balance Teachings and Criticism Sections
As the teachings section has a link to a teachings page which is 100% pro prem could someone restore Criticism of Prem Rawat and add a link from the criticism section? 82.150.96.2    

 Criticisms 

Since Prem Rawat is controversial a criticism section feels relevant. This criticism section has been deleted or removed several times without comments by Momento and/or others. A previous article called """"Criticism of Prem Rawat """" has also been deleted. It has also been noted that an external link to a site about Prem Rawat and his work has been removed by Jossi without comment. However edit warring is prohibited Wikipedia:Edit war.

Any disputes should be dealt with using the dispute resolution process. 76.102.196.148   178.26.39.46

User IP 76.102.196.148, you are an anonymous, unregistered user. This article is the only one you have ever edited. You have shown a dishonest approach by describing the website you tried to link to as a “website about Prem Rawat and his work.” I suspect you know very well that site is an unmoderated attack site set up with no purpose other than denigrating the subject of this article, who is a living person and protected by the Wikipedia guidelines and rules for  Biographies of living persons. You are doing yourself no favours and are heading for a charge of  disruptive editing. Please avoid this by reading the extensive archives of this discussion page before contributing again.   

User IP 76.102.196.148, you are an anonymous, unregistered user, just like me. This article is one of many that I have edited, but since my ISP changes my IP address from time to time, it just seems I am only editing articles relating to Mr Ji's operations at the moment. I am sometimes incredibly dishonest, but my contributions to wikipedia have to be assessed not on the basis of my appalling crimes, rather, whether they make sense and are informative. I know very well the ex-premie sites are antagonistic towards Mr Ji and that nothing must ever be published that calls into question his good name and the multiple money-collecting organisations run in his name. This is an important piece of international law, with which every article in wikipedia must comply with as at present, under pain of persecution from the latter-day Praetorian Guard. Your contributions will be mercilessly deleted by a handful of premies whose spiritual path has led them to be the guardians of the premie-controlled pages in wikipedia. All I can say is to repeat something once said by a little known British leader some while ago, a man called Winston Churchill. He said: """"Never give in, never give in, never, never, never, never - in nothing, great or small, large or petty - never give in except to convictions of honor and good sense. Never, Never, Never, Never give up. 84.9.48.220  

 Rumiton, your comment in it's current form can easily be seen as a personal attack. You should not make personal attacks anywhere in Wikipedia. Comment on content, not on the contributor. That's the policy. The site being referred to describes itself as an information resource covering Prem Rawat and his work, and according to Jossi's comment above it's ok to refer to a biased site such as the site",0.0

 Please help me end this drama once in for all 

I really do hate to get start making accusations, but I feel as if User:Delicious carbuncle is seriously heading down a road of corruption. It all started over a simple proposal at WP:VILLAGE where I skeptically proposed an idea for a template similar to the Template:Romeo warning for silly vandals apparently belonging to cheerleading squads. DC then started questioning my actions at WP:ABUSE, in which case I appropriately addressed his concerns. However, he seems to possibly have a problem with either my involvement at the project or perhaps even the project as a whole. He posted my real life first name, high school, and high school mascot in an example, in which case I raised concerns of WP:OUTING (note that his previous block for outing is unrelated). He said that it was merely a random name he chose, and I've chosen to WP:AGF in the matter, and you may treat that matter however you so desire. After receiving a comment on his talk page from a blatant IP troll that's been harassing me for over a month, he decided to start looking into the trolls claims about my handling of a repeat offender mainly known here as User:LBHS Cheerleader. He started heatedly questioning my actions, asking for diffs about bans. I had removed a """"suspected sockpuppet"""" template stating that the user might be related to User:Bobabobabo (which I had added over a year ago) and replaced it with a banned template since although I feel it's inappropriate that we were using Boba's ban against LBHSC without evidence, I similiarily felt it was inappropriate to all of a sudden to consider her """"debanned."""" I also added LBHSC to the list of community banned users as it seemed to be a consensus to me. I probably should have discussed this first, but I did not in light of WP:BOLD and WP:DENY (I didn't want to start a thread without absolutely needing to). Per WP:DUCK, it seems pretty obvious that LBHSC and her minions have been vandalizing for quite some time, at least since 2006, probably ban-worthy. However, I gracefully removed the contested templates when Delicious carbuncle started a thread at WP:AN/I in attempt to calmly settle the issue, and even stated that I would voluntarily abandon my efforts to combat LBHSC's disruption (beyond non-controversial reverting of blatant vandalism of course). DC ruthlessly refused to compromise, and I even contemplated retirement if only to save my name """"PCHS-NJROTC."""" Even then DC was not satisfied. Several users argued that LBHSC should indeed be considered banned as she would likely never be unblocked, including highly respected admins. Many editors, administrators, and even members of the WP:ArbCom have expressed their opinion that DC should move on. Even an admin who felt I had acted out of line and should be blocked stated that there's not enough support to keep the discussion going. Although there were those who defended my actions 100%, felt that although that the user should be banned but I should have discussed first, felt that I was being power hungry, and even thought that my actions were abusive, the general consenus of everybody was that I had offered settlement, learned important lessons, and that good faith should be assumed. Despite consensus, DC continued to revive the discussion over and over again, providing nothing new, and basically insisting on action. He has been warned repeatedly by several respected editors. He had stopped, and I had disengaged. I really wish this could have stayed in the past. However, Delicious carbuncle started User:Delicious_carbuncle/PCHS-NJROTC_ban_redux in the dawn of the new year. Considering the edit summary he used when creating the page, I initially thought his intentions were to use that as an arguement against someone who he is in conflict with known as User:Neutralhomer. In desire to not be involved in his conflict, I nominated the page for deletion at WP:MFD. I viewed it simply as an attack page which did not help the encyclopedia. I could have nominated for WP:CSD, but I didn't want to say that he was """"attacking me"""" as I was in favor of disengagement as was recommended at AN/I. In response to the MfD, he indicated that he intends to start yet another ban discussion. I'm not sure if he's wanting a topic ban on vandalism as before (which really isn't even a topic) or an all out ban. I did indicate that I would not stay here if I was topic banned, and that I would just assume be renamed to something unaffiliated with me (i.e. Vandal Fighter Missing in Action) and then be fully banned, but thankfully there's no support for either a topic ban or all out ban. It's clear that disengagement is still prefered based on some comments at the MfD discussion. After the original p",0.0

I always stick to the facts. Forget the Magyarisation terms. and now a little summary of your claim (try to concentrate):  There was full education in language X (like in Slovakia, Romania, Serbia, Croatia) and the government saw that (and this is your claim and is not true, because the same would apply to the neighbouring countires) the minorities start to lose their language. As a result it decided to restrict education in language X (you say to a few subjects, I say de-facto to 2 hours a week - but it does not matter), because there was """"no need"""" to teach some subjects in their language (which is a sociolinguistic non-sense). This is an illogical and actually chauvinist statement. What any normal government should do in such situation (wrongly claimed by you) is AT LEAST not restrict education in the language. Secondly, bilingual schools are no minority schools. Minority schools are only schools were the full language of education is the given language. Therefore the minority schools were literally shut down. This holds by definition and cannot be subject to any exaggeration.

 Temporary massive removal of some legendary history 

There were quite a few paragraphs discussing the ancient origins of the Yadavs, but as I was picking my way through it, it appeared a well-nigh impenetrable mass of confusing data, and likely a lot of WP:Synthesis. Terms such as Yadava/Yadav, Ahir/Yadav, and Abhira/Ahir were frequently conflated, and it appeared at many (most?) times that info was included without regard for whether the cited author gave any indication that his topic involved the modern Yadav caste. The info is not """"lost"""", it is cleanly preserved in the History tab, and its removal noted in Edit Summary and here so that any inclined editor can go back through it and carefully select the appropriate portions to re-incorporate. I submit that any info not specifically related to the modern Yadav go into the appropriate other articles such as Yadava and Abhira, etc. and that only material clearly linking the modern Yadavs to those ancient roots be included here. Otherwise, lengthy explanations of past groups with no clear link to the present group constitutes Synthesis, as it implies/pre-supposes a factual linkage when one may not be specified.

Again, I'm not trying to permanently wipe out this info, I just think the section was very unwieldy and contentious, and rather than pick and chip at it, it's better to temporarily wipe the slate clean, and then mine the past drafts to incorporate any usable data.   """,0.0

An event in this article is a April 30 selected anniversary (may be in HTML comment)

 A question has been bugging me 
From the time the first US military advisors stepped in to Vietnam in the early 60s to the final withdrawal of all US troops in 1973 the USSR and China repeatedly warned Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon NOT to cross the DMZ and directly invade North Vietnam. That seems simple enough that we were not allowed to go in to the North BUT my question is were the South Vietnamese Forces allowed to go on the offensive and invade North Vietnam? Did USSR and China ever warn the South not to invade the North? 

Considering the U.S.'s coordination with and funding for ARVN, I'm sure that they would take South Vietnamese ground forces in North Vietnam much the same way they'd take Marines. The only """"crossing of the DMZ"""" that occurred was American bombing raids.  
Probably not, but it is doubtful that such an operation could have been pulled off.  23 July 2005
It's hard to imagine what further threats the major communist powers could have used to dissuade S.V. from doing anything. But I agree with CJK, the limited competence of the ARVN in offensive operations seems well-established in the historical record, e.g. the offensive in Laos.  (talk) 03:04, 2005 July 24 (UTC)
The forgotten factor in this little chat is the fact that the South and its dissident """"South"""" Vietnamese were often the target of U.S. bombing. Keep in mind that the terms """"North"""" and """"South"""" were circumstantial, and not actually representative of the demographic split. """"North and South"""" often simply repeats the ideological and geographic claims about the nature of the war, which American soldiers, for example, found to be not the reality: Many (perhaps most) people in the """"democratic"""" South were pro-independence, despite the Western-allied/ethnic Catholic elite. Hence any use of """"North and South"""" carries an inherent biased disparity with the facts. -|t 
I don't know what you are talking about. We were discussing whether or not the Soviets or Chinese would react if South Vietnam sent its forces to invade North Vietnam.  24 July 2005
""""I dont know what you are talking about."""" Well, it would really help if you did, wouldnt it? -|t 
Well maybe you shouldn't bring up unrelated issues in the middle of a specific discussion.  25 July 2005
I'd just like to commend the recent additions to the article.  
Actually, to my understanding, there were still many rescue raids (of captured POWs) or commando attacks that were conducted by either U.S. commandos or the """"Biet Dong Quan"""" (the ARVN equivalent) against the north during the war. It's an honour to meet celebrities like you, Trey and Parker Stone. I appreciate your criticisms to my editions on the Vietnam War page. - .
well others watching this page are quite capable of RVing Marxist language and POV it seems.  
And would RVing 'capitalist language and POV' be ok with you? -|t 
I don't know what """"capitalist language"""" means, but if it existed and was POV then I would have no problems with its reversion.  
We were actually talking about a full scale attack by South Vietnam, not a raid.  24 July 2005

Let's assume the South Vietnamese Army, without US troop support, did gather a formidable invasion force and did cross the DMZ in to the North, would the Chinese and/or USSR intervene and play the """"defending an ally card"""" for the North exactly like how we did for the South?  
I know this is a hypothetical assumption, but still, it's irrelevant, because the ARVN was never able to operate well without U.S. assistance. So answering your hypothetical, if that did happen active intervention in the form of Chinese or Soviet troops would probably not be necessary given the PAVN's superior capabilities. if we had somehow managed to make the ARVN into a capable offensive force and we were able to take over North Vietnam then yes, I'd expect the PLA (army in China) to intervene just like they had in North Korea. but American go",0.0

:This review is transcluded from Talk:Laurence of Canterbury/GA1. The edit link for this section can be used to add comments to the review.

A few bits aren't clear to me. No suprises there I guess, given my almost complete ignorance of medieval English history:

I think the Gregorian mission mentioned in the lead needs just a word or two of explanation, such as """"... to convert the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity"""", or similar.

""""He was consecrated archbishop during the lifetime of his predecessor, Augustine of Canterbury. He continued efforts to coordinate with the native bishops of Britain, although his efforts were unsuccessful."""" I'd dearly love to combine these two sentences in some way, but I just don't understand what they're saying. So there were two Archbishops of Canterbury for a time? Who consecrated Laurence? Continued Augustine's efforts? """"Coordinate with the native bishops""""? In what way was he unsuccessful?

Energiewende
This is all about granularity.

I renamed it as it makes more sense as an article purely about Germany's efforts in transitioning to a low-carbon economy. An article only about Germany's Energiewende only will tend to remain on-topic and will in time become a good reference for Germany's efforts in sustainability. An article about every country under the sun can quickly become long list of overviews lacking in quality and usefulness.

If I were you I'd create one Wikipedia page for each country's Energiewende/Energy transition plans and efforts. Then you could create a """"metapage"""" – yes, call it for now """"Energy transition"""" (in lieu of a better title though something like """"Energy transition by country"""" or '""""Energy transitions worldwide"""" would be better) – and on that page there can be sub-headings for each country, each with a """"See also"""" link directly under the sub-heading which links to each of those country-specific articles on Wikipedia. Then a short summary can be provided summarising the info on each country-specific page (which, as I mentioned above re: Germany, will tend to remain on-topic and will become good references for the Energy transition efforts in each county over time, blah blah.) Such summaries are easier to keep concise and sticking to the salient points of the pages they refer to; this is of enormous benefit to the reader.

Contrast this to Wikipedia pages crammed with information on many countries. Such pages abound throughout Wikipedia. These pages tend to ramble on and on and are often the cause of so much duplication on Wikipedia. It is so much easier to write text and stick it up on Wikipedia than it is to locate, edit, and re-organise the info already on Wikipedia to make a single repository of information about it - that's the granularity I'm talking about.

So question in point, how will your page differentiate itself with pages like the Renewable energy in Germany page for example or the Energy in France page? There are also other pages out there which have overlapping information just for Germany alone such as Germany National Renewable Energy Action Plan. Are you going to add to the jumble? Stick to the principle of granularity and its easier to not do so.

At the moment there is a four day hiatus while the GA reviewer is busy at work.
The images had become an issue - I originally just hid them with a drop down before realising that no matter which way I tried, the alt= and alt text were not working (in fact alt= was visible). The GA reviewer thinks they would be better spread out over the page, but I am not so sure. I was trying to keep it more balanced between shipwreck and treasure, as they are equally important, but without the Jewel pics (as they have not emailed me back yet) perhaps it might be better to spread them around.

 Talk of scientific principles is pseudoscience which was discarded in the Renaissance.  Modern science is essentially empirical - it makes experiments and observations.  Theories and principles are secondary and must follow these results whither they lead, whether they make sense or not.  In medicine, simple mechanistic ideas do not suffice to explain many observations.  For example, if you give someone an emetic in a certain way then it is found to have the opposite effect of preventing nausea.  It seems that the doctor-patient relationship plays a considerable part in this and it may be that homeopathy is especially efficacious in this regard.  Our lede should not be dogmatic when the matter is not fully understood.   13:06",0.0

GoodDay, the countries category is called just that, not 'Independant countries'. Wales, Scotland and England are countries (NI is not, but that's another matter). As they are countries they belong in the countries category, perfectly logically. In any case, this has been discussed repeatedly and the consensus is - as if we needed to be told! - that they are countries. Despite my opposition to the inclusion of the Six Counties - English Wikipedia has followed the political line of the New Labour UK government, a lie line which is contrary to the Belfast Agreement - I am tempted to agree with the compromise 'Category:Countries of the United Kingdom' but would like to hear other people's opinion as well. It's disappointing and somewhat surprising that such a significant change has attracted so little comment. Perhaps what we really need here in the long term is a clearer practical distinction between the terms 'country' and 'sovereign state'. BritishWatcher says above that he """"supported and accepted the fact England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland should be called countries"""" but opposes them """"appearing on lists of countries (where only sovereign states are listed)"""".

 NPOV again 

First of all, I'm Brazilian and PRO Lula. I want a more neutral article. Not all the people in Brazil, I know, like him. But not all the people hate him. Every one knows what NPOV means, it would be rather a Multiple Point of view. So, criticism and good things must come together. Althou, Wikipedia cannot agree with bias, hate or fanatism.
Here is a list of some alterations I made and a bit of opinion:

 Biography: it is alright. It is a standart biography...
 Elections... """"In the second round of the 2002 election, (...) and became the president of Brazil."""" instead of """"to become the president-elect of Brazil"""". Just a bit of grammar.3
 The Government - Political Orientation: some time before, I transfered a piece of text about the radical-left-wing of PT from this article to PT's article. I DID NOT DELETED it. I just put it in a better place, because it is not a personal problem of Lula, but a problem for the party. Every one agree? The external links about it i tranfered to PT's article, too.
 The Government - Reforms and Important Laws. When I first wrote it I put each item as a section (I was pretending to write a piece of text for each one). It was oversized and so, following a sugestion, I changed it in a list. All right?
 Deleted: """"Unfortunately, there has been no control over the program on behalf of the government and """"Bolsa Família"""" has been transformed into mere populism."""" - It is not the common sense. It is a political point of view of an action of the government. Populism is a dangerous word that must be avoided.

I agree with  that “Georgian scripts“ would be a better title, or perhaps “Georgian alphabets” or “Georgian writing” (although this might be confused with Georgian literature). I certainly agree with the proposer that the present name is unsatisfactory, as the article covers three distinct scripts, and at least alludes to the existence of more than one mkhedruli alphabet. That said, I don’t have a strong objection to “Georgian script”, which would at least be an improvement, and seems to line up with the Latin and Cyrillic articles (the latter seems to me particularly worth emulating) in comprising a range of regional & historical varieties.—1479 """,0.0

 Spam? Where? 
You keep on mentioning that when 195.64.95.116 is linking to this webpage it is considered """"spam"""". You even see this to be reason to block this IP for a week(!). Please define what you think is spam, because where I come from his/her linking to this particular website is anything but spam.

In fact, when I looked into this IP-address you blocked, I found that it resolves to """"jult.net"""", not to jthz.com, and even though it might be used by Julius, who is also one of the creators of the page you regard as spam, I still don't see the connection to """"spam"""".

I read this nazi-like threat on the talk-page for my IP-address;
I thought you quit. If you don't stop spamming the MP3 article with links to your own website I'm going to block you from editing.  

1. I quit what? I never started or ended anything.
2. It's not spam and it has never been spam (and you know it isn't, your beef is something else, I don't even know what it is). Links YOU left in there ARE spam though, but you seem to be blind to those, so I will remove them for you.
3. Our webpage reaches more than 200 audio-enthusiasts daily, because it is informative on the subject, and has been since 1997.
4. If you keep on threatening me in this ridiculously nazi-manner of yours, I will report your behavior to those in charge, and we'll see about you being able to block perfectly valid links from being on that page. On top of that I will annoy you where and however I possibly can without breaking the law, your stalkerlike behavior is quite sickening and needs to stop.

Wolter had sent them the true facts on his career, but the editors of Wikipedia refused to eliminate the recent anonymous edits. Wolter added that immediately prior to the premier of """"America Unearthed,"""" several articles he had written or contributed to in Wikipedia had been simultaneously “gutted” or deleted by a self-appointed Wikipedia editor in rural England named Doug Weller.  Wikipedia provides little information on Doug Weller other than that he has been designated a “purple gatekeeper.” Weller has no professional qualifications in geology. Until 2006 he claimed to be an archaeologist, but withdrew that claim when exposed. Surprisingly, Weller has also been editing Wikipedia articles about the history of the Southeastern United States.

 Andrew Nellis article 

Sorry, but you are abusing the condition of your admin status and the Andrew Nellis article has been recreated in accordance with conditions with Wikipedia rules. There was a 7-7 vote on the article being deleted and there was never any consenus to delete this article. There has been a proper deletion review post made on  September 30th 2006. I have also contacted Wikipedia concerning this matter as I  feel it is insulting for one admin to delete articles based soley on what he feels are """"real"""" users on Wikipedia. The user asking for deletion claimed the article was a vanity page. In fact, there is ample evidence from the early history of the Andrew Nellis page that it was created by the same people who eventually asked for its deletion. At first the article made light of Nellis' weight, health problems and political ambitions. This was changed and so-called vanity portions of the article were removed. When the article took the shape of an actual Wikipedia article, the users on Dalnet IRC, primarily those from the #Atheism and #memes channels called for its deletion as it no longer mocked Nellis' weight and other health problems. I am going to recreate this article as long as there is no consensus and as long as wikipedia admins wrongfully delete the article. """,0.0

Looks like there's a full-scale edit-war going on again, so I will be staying away. I thought it was stable so I corrected a grammatical nonsense. If a thing never happens again, you can say that the following day it didn't happen, or several months later it didn't happen, or fifty years later it didn't happen, and no one of those statements makes more sense than any other. On the other hand, if a thing does happen, for instance at the end of a year when it is expected to happen, you can still say that after several months it didn't happen, and that might be quite true, although it would still be nonsensical and in this case also misleading. I changed it to """"Buck's contract with Vogue was not renewed"""", period, which in fact gives exactly the same amount of information. If you knew when the contract was due to be removed, you could say that, and that would be a useful addition, but nobody has ever thought to do that. In any case, if you're busting a blood vessel and writing a splenetic message on somebody's talk page over such a simple edit, it might be time for you to take a step back and try to get a sense of proportion.

"""==Name==
I've been studying Satmar for a good bit, and I've been to Kiryas Joel. I've never heard it called """"Sakmer"""". Are we sure about this?  
I've been around many Hasidim for a long, long time too, and I have never heard of Sakmer either, so it may just be baloney and that word should be removed.  
there is a street in KJ called Sakmer

also: look at this http://tovrent.com/satmar/85.jpg

The reason some call it Sakmer is because the name Satmer is based on Satu Mare which remotely referes Saint Mary [NOTE - not true, Satu Mare means simply """"Large Village"""" in Romanian!]. Hassidic Jews have always refrained from sanctifying Christian saints and therefore have created alternative names for quite a few cities. Izak love, when you don't know something, that does not make it balony.   PS, I haven't been """"studying"""" Satmer - I am one, and my maternal grandfather referes to his birthplace as Sakmer (AKA Satu Mare). PPS There is no KJ street called Sakmer. The photo you attached clearly dubbs the Satmar Rabbi """"The Rav of Sakmer"""". For those who study Satmer but have no knowledge of the script which the Satmers use, the word is the one at the lower left corner looking something like this: סאקמער. The third letter from the right carries the K sound. Cheers.

I recently heard in regular chatting from an acquaintence that an ancestor (great-grandfather?) of his called Satmar Sakmer. Why do they not utilize that term anymore? And, I'm done with my hardcore pshat study of different Hasidic groups.  

It's total nonsense, the 'saint mary' story. Satu Mare means 'large town'. My father has been there many times. Wikipedia (yes yes) also says that Satu Mare means 'large town', and that 'saint mary' is something else entirely in Hungarian/Romanian.  
I revised the opening paragraph by indicating the Satmars are one of the largest hasidic groups - it is widely thought there are about 200,000 Lubavitchers, but since none of the hasidic groups keeps a formal membership role, this is all conjecture - it would be incorrect for any group to claim they are the largest, there is no way of knowing. 

About Satmar and NETUREI KARTA. THe Cherem bit is incorrect, as is the bit of a denunciation. Also the part of asking Reb Yoilish to meet with Yasser Arrafat. It's all myth. Yasser Arafat and the PLO were not the public face of the Palestinian cause before Reb Yoilish had his stroke, so it doesn't make sense. I actually asked a chaver of the Satmar Beis Din about the Cherem, and he said it's nonsense. The Beis DIn has not publicly issued a cherem against a person or group of people since its formation in the United States. No denunciation was issued either. It's a made up propaganda piece by the Kakhnik radio station Arutz Sheva. It never happened. No such thing ever appeared in Der Yid, which is the official newspaper.

 Etymology 

with Satu coming from the same root as """"city"""" (civitas)

Actually, it's not like this. In Romanian, """"satu"""" is derived from Latin """"fossatum"""" and it originally meant a village encircled by a moat (in Latin """"fossa""""). """"Cetate"""" is the Romanian word derived from """"civitas"""".  | Talk

Since the vista article contains information about the anti trust situation which, since it seems some people here have got a mouthful of gate's balls, is mislabelled anti trust controversy. Not really a controversy though is it when a court elected by over two hundred million people issues a decision, it'a court ruling, like it or not there's no controversy too that. Otherwise we should renaim the ted bundy trial, to the tend bundy controversy, since any court ruling merits this label. 

Since there's a section on anti trust laws and vista, it's worth noting the recent news that microsoft are going to be paying a hefty daily fine for completely ignoring the court's injuction. And this does have bearing on vista. You can't quote the m.s. pr saying we don't know what they want us to do, it's all questions, or whatever else he mentioned, without an adjunct sentence, of the head official regulating the anti trust actions quoting him too saying that our injuctions are crystal clear yet ms has ignored them for over two years now. 

But of course this has no bearing if this article is supposed to be a showcase for vista.

So like i said, if some fuckers had gone into the trouble of actually discussing any of that instead of reverted every single edit in a hitleric fashion, things would be different.

But for now this stategy of being a hawk on an article I wish to keep in a certain way, and being completely uncivil and rude about it, merits from my part a roayl, fuck y's all, take your mouths off of gate's balls and then we can talk.

"Namboothiris are generally thought of as priest because their predominant profession is preisthood inspite of the small proprtion of mailies that belong to professions like adukkala, arangu and Kadavu that donot study vedam.So that is why predominant profession logic compels  nairs to be classified as a martial class and ezhavas as toddy tappers.

1.Aadu -They are specialised in Yaagam
2. Edu - They have the right to acquire knowledge and teach Sanskrit, Vedam, Linguistics, Astronomy, Astrology, Architecture and so on. 
3. Bhiksha (alms, symbolising a saint or a samnyaasi): They have the right to become a saint (or samnyaasi).

5. Othu (Spiritual hymns): This class of Namboothiris was basically teachers of Othu (Vedam).

 7. Adukkala  These Namboothiri families were specialists in large-scale cooking and catering.
 8. Arangu (stage): This special group of Namboothiris, called Chaathira Namboothiris, was a military group. Their evening entertainment was Panemkali (Sanghakkali).

 Arrested for Panhandling 

I was arrested in Nashville, TN at Church St. and George L. Davis Blvd.  I was not adequately told what I was arrested for.  I was kept in booking for 20 hours where I saw people are routinely and currently being kept for 72 hours and usually more.  The """"innocent until proven guilty"""" aren't allotted any beds, nor did the employees allow them to lie down.  I was told that I could plead guilty to something, I have no idea what, something about soliciting for business or ride.  No one employed in any part of this was capable of reading the statute aloud.  The public defender told me I could sit, literally sit, in booking for four days and nights until the officer was subpoenaed and then the case would be dismissed or I could be released that afternoon.  I volunteer a lot.  I was to be volunteering at the 2nd Annual Music City BBQ by then, and I cannot volunteer if I have been sitting for 96 hours.  I was arrested for and while sitting on a guard rail while holding a piece of cardboard with """"Hard Times / God Bless / Blessed Day"""" on it.  I was not provided with any documentation of my own of my having been arrested at anytime.  I was not told the offense for which I was being arrested.  One police officer said """"Soliciting"""" to me.  I was lied to with statements of """"You can find the statute underwhich you are being arrested at metro.com"""" and """"you can see what happened at nashvillemetro.com""""  I was not given any reason for why I was being arrested, and at least 20 cars drove by clearly listening in on the scanner to see what was going on.  I have no idea what they were accusing me of, whom the arresting officer was, whom the public defender was, whom the prosecuting attorney was, whom the magistrate was, nor whom some guy I have no idea what function is who told everyone that if they asked any questions of the magistrate that the magistrate would take unkindly upon them and would force them into further holding for non-competence.

In the competitive world the people are busy with their work,
employment and they are neglecting their parents in maintaining and
looking after their welfare due to which their parents are becoming as
baggers and orphans.
Due to insufficient earnings, financial problems for educating their
children and maintaining their families now a days most of the people
are neglecting their elder family members in their old age and they
are leaving them in any where as orphans.
Daily we are reading the above incidents in News Papers, viewing in
News channels and hearing the same.  As per one survey 1300 old age
people per year are committing suicides in our State.  The suicides
are increasing year by year.
The old age orphans are suffering from poor eyesight, unhealthy
hungry, homeless, dumbness and even though they are begging, no body
will come forward to help the old age orphans and they are facing
unbearable problems and troubles.
The old age people are living as orphans and lifeless persons, though
they are having their own persons and they are doing begging under the
trees, in the bus stands, railway stations, footpaths what we have to
do their remaining lives as happiness? What we have to do help and
service as human beings?As a dutiful citizens we came forward with our own free will through
Sri.Arlagadda Vasu, Charitable Trust to help and do service to the old
age orphans with an intention to construct good old age home, to
provide residence to the destitute old age persons, to serve food,
clothes and supply medicines to them freely under 24 hours supervision
and we intend to do their valuable remaining life with happiness until
their last breathing by saying courage to them.Since the construction and maintenance of old age home is the
financial problem, we intend to collect donations from the donators.

"RIR, it seems obvious you don't like the presence of Usana corp reps by your attempts to discredit them immediately upon arrival by asking Jean314 for proof of vandalism/sock puppetry, but none of the 4 behaviors in the inappropriate notification policy apply to this request for insiders:
Spamming: Posting an excessive number of messages to individual users, or to users with no significant connection to the topic at hand.
Campaigning: Posting a notification of discussion that presents the topic in a non-neutral manner.
Vote-stacking: Posting messages to users selected based on their known opinions (which may be made known by a userbox, user category, or prior statement). Vote-banking involves recruiting editors perceived as having a common viewpoint for a group, similar to a political party, in the expectation that notifying the group of any discussion related to that viewpoint will result in a numerical advantage, much as a form of prearranged vote stacking.
Stealth canvassing: Contacting users off-wiki (by e-mail, for example) to persuade them to join in discussions (unless there is a specific reason not to use talk pages)
Soliciting support other than by posting direct messages, such as using a custom signature with a message promoting a specific position on any issue being discussed.

Neither of the 2 corp accounts have any say in controversial discussions, and I would prefer they don't even comment on those.  My original request was to have them point out inaccuracies in the article of which they have sourced proof is wrong.  Items we have no idea they are incorrect unless someone pointed them out.

""":Voltaire as an egalitarian is about the funniest thing I've heard in a long time; of course he was not (and harldy any of the Enlightenment philosophes were). Does that diminish his statue as a thinker? Of course not; non-conformity with 21st-century sensibilities hardly matters in any assessment of an 18th-century thinker. As for the discussion of Voltaire's racism/anti-semitism we obviously must apply similar principles apply. Throwing in a few decontextualised quotes about Voltaire's view on Jews and black people to demonstrate that he was a raving racist is simply meaningless. If these issues are to be included in the entry at all (which I doubt they warrant), then surely they need contextualisation. For instance, Voltaire's discussion on Jews surely must be understood in the context of his general account of revealed religion, and must be set in the context of 18th-century censorship (which often led writers to attack the Jews whilst actually aiming at their Christian off-spring). Similarly, Voltaire's views on non-white people cannot be understood outside the context of his general framework of savagery, barbarism, civilisation and historical development. If people started to read Voltaire in such contexts, then they would start to understand that the question of whether Voltaire was a """"racist, anti-semitist, egalitarian, etc.""""? is pretty much meaningless and doesn't increase our understanding of him at all. However, given the above discussion, I sort of doubt whether wikipedia readers/editors understand enough history to appreciate this.

 Dear Kumarrao, No ill feelings I was just following wiki standards. Even I have refered govt inscriptions and """"Census of India, 1961"""" earlier in my wiki writings but they are not considered as reliable by wiki Admins. The reliability depends on the wide acceptibilty.

"Basic concept of GPS 

Hi!

There are two different issues with the introduction.  The first is style - this is supposed to be a very easy-to-read introduction.  The description as intersecting spheres is covered in much detail later in the article.  Since the article is already very long, perhaps another description is not needed in the introduction.

The second issue is the number of satellites needed.  This is 3 with an accurate clock (a ns or so will suffice).  This gives the distance to 3 satellites, which is enough to determine position.  (These will be 2 solutions, but only one can be close to the surface of the Earth, so this is not a practical problem.)  With 4 satellites you need only a crude clock, provided your hardware measures the 4 satellites at (almost) the same time.  This allows you to solve for x,y,z, and t.

"Nothing about recombination 

It is ridiculous that all focus is dedicated on how animals select a partner that in 100 kb text we cannot even afford a note on why do they do that in the first place. Ok, male expose higher mutation rate and thus expose higher variability: most of the men are defected whereas others are extremely cute. They can spread they genes as hell and best features can be conserved in women, who undergo much less mutation and exist solely to conserve best genes (best trials, aka best men). This was said in the article, albeit not pronounced clearly. Better exposition of this part would shed some light on why do we have men and women in the first place. It would be even better to say something about recombination. Recombination, aka sexual reproduction or crossover is what allows to combine best features from different individuals. It makes evolution much faster than single individual mutation. Just imagine: one guy fortunately acquires one feature, another guy acquires another feature, third guy acquires some another feature. Now, if they cannot recombine and exchange their knowledge, they have to discover everything themselves. On the other hand, “If you have an apple and I have an apple and we exchange these apples then you and I will still each have one apple. But if you have an idea and I have an idea and we exchange these ideas, then each of us will have two ideas.” Bernard Shaw explains the recombination principle: The human culture has advanced so rapidly just because you could spread the knowledge for free (I am not talking about climate in Wikipedia). Imagine that you had to discover everything yourself. You would still live in a cave age. So, recombination, sexual reproduction, is extreemly powerful. The flirt affairs sucked around is not as closely crucial. Why cannot we have even a reference to the recombination?",0.0

External Memory
I believe that the External Memory section should be broken into two separate sections or more firmly defined within the same section. One on """"Self Identity"""" and using external objects to identify one's self, and """"External Memory"""" being stored memories and information. Here are my reasons.

Self Identity:
In """"Stand Alone Complex"""" Episode 25, Batou says to Kusunagi about her watch """"No matter how many prosthetic bodies you went through, this was the one thing that was always ticking away the same time as you, right? In this time that's far too fleeting, people entrust memories to external devices because they want to set down proof that can identify them as a unique individual. For you, isn't that watch the one external mnemonic device that can identify the person you've been up until now?""""

This says that external mnemonic devices are to create a sense of unchanging self in a world where you can switch physical bodies on the fly. As biological humans our forms are fixed and unchanging for the most part and our self identity is tied deeply with that. In the GiTS universe, that is not true and you must tie your self-identity to external objects such as a watch or weight training to distinguish yourself from the rest of the identical mass produced cyborg bodies and create a sense of individuality. There are references in SAC 2ng Gig Episode 8 about cyborg food satisfying the brains cravings and as a reminder of times before becoming a cyborg. In SAC 2nd Gig Episode 11 there is a store that keeps and maintains external mnemonic devices that remind their owners of their own personal memories. All of these """"external mnemonic devices"""" are used to trigger memories in one's self, but can not relay detailed information to a stranger.

External Memory:
External Memory is exactly that, memories and experiences that are stored """"offline"""" onto a hard disk or such. If you posses a cyber brain, there is a definite separation of mind and body since your brain case can be removed and put into a new body. Since there is an electronic separation, the signals received from the senses (touch, taste, etc.) can be recorded and replayed at any given time. Thus, you could record important events such as your wedding day and replay it as if you were actually there anytime you wish. Your external senses turn off, and you’re fed recorded sensory information. Better than any video camera recording, your feeling the heat of the sun, the breeze, your brides’ hand trembling as you slip the ring on her finger, etc. Storing these memories also allows others to play them back and experience them as well. This would be a highly valuable technology for all areas of use; fully immersive gaming and movies, virtual business meetings that feel completely real, instantaneous access to wikipedia anywhere. In SAC 2ng Gig Ep 23, Batou talks about using Kusunagi's external memories to keep Gohda talking in Ep 22. He also talks about peeking at her external memories regarding Kuze. In SAC Ep 10 Ishikawa experiences Batou's memories from the murder scene. SAC Ep 21 the whole team replays Togusa's memories from the Sunflower Society office when he was shot.

SUPREME COURT, STATE OF COLORADO 

No. 98SA447 

ORIGINAL PROCEEDING IN DISCIPLINE 

January 25, 1999 

IN THE MATTER OF FRED BAUDER 

EN BANC ATTORNEY SUSPENDED 

Linda Donnelly, Attorney Regulation Counsel 

James C. Coyle, Assistant Attorney Regulation Counsel 

Denver, Colorado 

Fred Bauder, Pro Se 

Crestone, Colorado 

PER CURIAM 

In this lawyer discipline case, a hearing panel of the supreme court grievance committee approved the findings and recommendation of the hearing board. The board and the panel recommended that the respondent, Fred Bauder, be suspended for thirty days, be required to petition for reinstatement, and pay certain costs before again being allowed to practice law. We accept the recommendation. 

I. 

Fred Bauder was licensed to practice law in Colorado in 1976. He failed to answer the formal complaint filed in this case and the hearing board entered a default against him. The allegations of fact contained in the complaint were therefore deemed admitted. See C.R.C.P. 241.13(b); People v. Paulson , 930 P.2d 582, 582 (Colo. 1997). Based on the default and the evidence presented, the hearing board found that the following had been established by clear and convincing evidence. 

On July 14, 1997, we publicly censured Bauder for soliciting for prostitution during a phone call with the wife of a dissolution of marriage client. See People v. Bauder , 941 P.2d 282, 283 (Colo. 1997). Bauder was ordered to pay the costs of that proceeding in the amount of $2,058.97 within thirty days of the date on the opinion. See id. at 283-84. He did not pay the costs as ordered, however, or file a motion for an extension of time to comply with our order. Moreover, Bauder failed to respond to a letter from the Office of Disciplinary Counsel and has not explained or justified his noncompliance with the order. As a result, a request for investigation was filed against him. Bauder did not respond to the request for investigation. 

The hearing board concluded that Bauder knowingly disobeyed an order of this court in violation of Colo. RPC 3.4(c); and that his conduct also violated Colo. RPC 8.4(d) (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice) and C.R.C.P. 241.6(7) (failing to cooperate in a disciplinary investigation). 

II. 

The hearing panel approved the board's recommendation that Bauder be suspended for thirty days, be required to petition for reinstatement, and as a further condition of reinstatement, demonstrate that he has paid the costs incurred in the 1997 proceeding. 

Under the ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions (1991 & Supp. 1992) (ABA Standards ), """"[s]uspension is appropriate when a lawyer knowingly violates a court order or rule, and there is injury or potential injury to a client or a party, or interference or potential interference with a legal proceeding."""" ABA Standards 6.22. However, disbarment is warranted when a lawyer """"(a) intentionally or knowingly violates the terms of a prior disciplinary order and such violation causes injury or potential injury to a client, the public, the legal system, or the profession."""" Id. at 8.1(a). 

The 1997 public censure is an aggravating factor for analyzing the proper level of discipline. See id. at 9.22(a). Other aggravating factors include Bauder's refusal to acknowledge the wrongfulness of his conduct, see id. at 9.22(g); his substantial experience in the practice of law, see id. at 9.22(i); and his indifference to making restitution, see id. at 9.22(j). Because Bauder did not appear at the hearing or offer any evidence, no mitigating factors were found. 

The lawyer respondent has defaulted and apparently ignored the disciplinary proceedings. We elect to accept the board's recommendation. See People v. Rishel , 956 P.2d 542, 544 (Colo. 1998). We are satisfied that the requirement that the respondent undergo reinstatement proceedings and demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that he is again fit to practice law will adequately protect the public. Accordingly, we accept the recommendations of the hearing board and panel. One member of the court, however, would impose more severe discipline. 

III. 

It is hereby ordered that Fred Bauder is suspended from the practice of law for thirty days, effective thirty days after the issuance of this opinion. It is further ordered that, prior to seeking reinstatement a",0.0

"Type 1 - missing the point 

Due to the general requirement of the use of some social engineering in this case (and normally in Type 0 vulnerabilities as well), many programmers have disregarded these holes as not terribly important. This misconception is sometimes applied to XSS holes in general (even though this is only one type of XSS) and there is often disagreement in the security community as to the importance of cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.
This section misses the entire point. If I wanted to grab cookies from users using some form of local JavaScript exploit (just an example, there are hundreds of other things possible), I could use a type 1 vulnerability on a forum or popular website in order to attack the maximum number of users. The social engineering side of it is therefore a side-note, as it only applies when an attacker is targeting one specific user - and even then if they know they frequent that site they don't have to social engineer them at all.

Furthermore, what's with the names in the exploit scenarios? I'm all for equality but I'd like to see names in there that are at least somewhat universally pronounceable and single-barrelled. Try something like Anne instead of Lorenzo de Medici. 86.14.89.251",0.0

Oops, my bad.  Here's the explanation.  When I do a restoration I always upload an unrestored version for documentation purposes.

So as soon as I realized the mistake I uploaded over at Commons and put a deletion request on the local version.  There's seldom any need for the unrestored version of a featured picture to have a hosting locally.  The restored version got featured, though.  So there's a reason to host it locally: the featured star is useful if anyone considers replacing it at an article (and occasionally editors do accidentally remove featured pictures from their primary articles).

My main concern here is that to note consequences of the war in the lede but NOT mention the occupation would be a huge error of omission, since one could very easily argue this is the single most consequential result of the war, with incalculable repercussions, and not only for just the Middle East.

"""Kurt and Dave get it on?==

Groaning Kurt released his cock. For the past week he hadn't been able to get off. He tried a cocktail of drugs and a cocktail of whores. Nothing was doing it for him. Masturbating in the shower wasn't even working. Oh he was getting hard all right, he just couldn't fucking cum. And it was driving him nuts.

To top it off, he didn't know why he couldn't cum. The girls had been either hot enough or slutty enough. Even the couple of guys he brought home had been decent. Despite that, he couldn't fucking cum. And a week of that was enough to make anyone more pissy than normal.

Which meant band practice was unlikely to be much fun for anyone.

That was made abundantly clear the moment Kurt stepped into the rehearsal studio. His eyes flicked from Krist to Dave and he came to a sudden stop. Dave was sitting on a couch, a pretty girl in his lap giggling. It was like he was taunting Kurt. And he would have nothing of that.

Stalking over to the drummer and the floozie, Kurt pulled her forcibly out of his lap. The girl squealed and Dave growled, but Kurt paid no attention, forcing the girl out of the studio. After slamming the door he headed back over to Dave. Without a word he pulled the drummer to him and kissed him possessively.

Dave shoved Kurt away, """"What part of no don't you fucking understand!?""""

Krist's eyes widened and he took a step forward, """"Guys, I think—""""

Kurt sent him a silent glare, silencing and stopping him.

""""I don't want you, Kurt. I don't even fucking like you right now,"""" Dave growled. """"In fact, I fucking quit! I don't have to put up with this shit. You're fucking insane. You need some other crackwhore to take my place. I'm not it.""""

Sidestepping the singer, Dave headed towards the door. He barely made three steps before Kurt grabbed him again. This time his back was pulled to Kurt's front. He could clearly feel the singer's erection pressing into his ass.

He wasn't going to be anyone's bitch.

""""I'm just gonna... go,"""" Krist muttered before slipping out of the room quickly.

""""You're fucking mine, Dave,"""" Kurt declared, licking Dave's neck. """"Always.""""

For as small as he was, Kurt had more strength than Dave expected. With considerably less effort than he would have figured, the singer forced the drummer down to the floor. Dave wiggled and tried to crawl away, but all that resulted was in Kurt pulling the drummer's pants off.

Laying down on top of Dave while he worked his own pants off, Kurt hissed in his ear, """"You're mine. You hear me? Fucking mine.""""

""""Stop! Kurt, stop!"""" Dave struggled.

With Kurt's weight on him, the drummer had very little maneuverability. He was completely trapped. But that didn't mean he stopped trying to get away. While wholly his struggling was probably a good thing, it wasn't really helping. If anything it was turning Kurt on more.

Not having the patience to remove Dave's boxers, Kurt reached down and tore the back seam, exposing the drummer's ass. He didn't even pause to warn Dave. His hands spread Dave's cheeks, spit down his crack to provide some lubrication, and quickly pushed his cock in. Dave screamed, wiggling once more to get away. With Kurt's hands holding onto his hips, he had no chance to go anywhere, at least not until the singer was done.

Dave's screams faded into sobs. That alone drove Kurt further, faster. He loved everything about it. The way Dave's ass squeezed his cock better than anyone else's had before. He was a perfect glove, a perfect fit. Before too long a week's worth of unreleased cum spurted from Kurt's cock.

Slowly he pulled out, not really caring about the mixture of blood and semen leaking from Dave's ass. Grinning to himself he refastened his pants. He glanced at Dave, a feeling of superiority infusing him. He totally owned Dave now. 

Does anyone have any basis for this rumour? I would love to put it on the main page.

"FK Vardar 

FK Vardar is a Macedonian Football club, the club changed its name several times during its history, from original Vardar in 1911 to Citizens Football Club Vardar or just Citizens( Gragjanski in Macedonian ) in 1920, then Football Club Makedonija in 1946 and finally back to FC Vardar in 1947. By the name FC Citizens( Vardar ) the club won 4 championships from 1936 till 1939. About Yugoslavia, you have to know that Yugoslavia was a federation of 6 Republics -countries together and each Republic had its own championship, and there was a Federal League where teams from the Republics competed together. Each Republic had its own Cup and the cup winners competed in the Marshals Cup, that cup was held in honor of Joseph Broz the marshal of the Federation, and its was called the Cup of the Marshal. How ever FC Vardar never won the Federal league ( League made of Federation of 6 Republics best teams ,thats why its called the Federal League, and not Yugoslavian League nor Yugoslavian Cup). The title in 1987 was won by FC Partizan Belgrade , you can check in any official statistics or documents. The second federal league was made of two Second Federal Leagues , East ( 3 Republics competed, Serbia ,Monte Negro,Macedonia and two Provinces- almost the same as Republics but yet without a nation ,those were Kosovo and Vojvodinship ) and West ( 3 Republics, Croatia, Bosnia and Slovenia, sometimes clubs from province Vojvodinship  would compete in the West depending on the federation decisions ). In the period of 1922 till 1929, present day Republic of Macedonia was established as 4 provinces within the Kingdom of Serbs Croats and Slovenes, those 4 provinces were Skopje, Bitola,Shtip and Vranje prvinces. These 4 provinces established the Macedonian Football Federation in 1926,and they held 3 championships. In 1929 these 4 provinces joined in one Duchy and this championship was held in the Duchy ( Banovina ) for 11 times.During the WW2 the championship was held under German Occupation, and the German government recognized this League. After the WW2 the very same championship was tranformed in to Republic Football League ,just the Province of Vranje was separated from the Republic as Macedonia transformed from Duchy to a Republic and the province of Vranje was under the newly made Republic of Serbia in 1946. The bottom line is since the Federation of 6 Republics split in the 90s, Macedonian Republic League was transformed in to Macedonian First League. So it is the same League that changed names and competition format during the decades, and now it came to this Level. Its a petty that there is lots of politics and territorial pretensions lots of denial of the existence of the Macedonia and other Republics in the Federation , by the Serbian side. Serbian official politic is to show that Yugoslavia was one country and nation mainly based on Serb character and they are stilling all the history including history of sports in this case football. They are trying to show the world that there was Yugoslav nation ( Serb ) and only Yugoslav Football league ( Serb League ) denying the Federal League second Federal League and Republic Leagues. They want to show only Yugoslav League and not the real Federal League. They hold all the champions from the Federal League as Serbian Champions in every competition. For FC Vardar at this point of view considering that  Macedonia is not in the Federetion for more than 20 years,and it wont be in the future ,the most important are the titles and trophies won in the Macedonian League , and if you wont to put additional trophies won in the Federation ,the period before 1991 you should write the precise information. Second Federal League East is the name of the competition, and you should put the Macedonian Flag from that period of the time next to it,instead of the federal flag, simply because that federation dont exist anymore and doesnt represent any country nor nation. About the cup , you should write down the real proper name as it was called ,Marshals Cup also fallowed by Macedonian flag from that period of the time, you should put a notice that in the Federal Second League East , clubs from Serbia Macedonia and Monte Negro competed including the provinces of Kosovo i Vojvodinship.",0.0

Biography and creativity
 
[edit] Early years
 
Viktoria Daynekos born on 12 May 1987 in village in the Kirov Taldy-Kurgan area. Her childhood was spent in the Yakut city Mirny (Yakutia). Since her childhood, she dreamed of becoming a variety singer, but her parents did not take her desire seriously. In school, Victoria (Vika) started to sing various Mirny (Yakutia) musical genres, mainly covering the hits of others. As she was in a small town, without any special educational institutions, Vika educated herself.  Vika seriously engaged the English language.
 
[edit] Star Factory
 
Alla Pugacheva is DOUBTLESS a link here... should be looked up and added

In 2004 Victoria was the participant of the Channel One’s teleproject Star Factory Series 5 under the direction of Alla Pugacheva, which she won. Within the limits of the teleproject, Victoria sang two solo songs — «I will be better» and """"Leila"""".  Vika also sang a duet with Alexander Marshal «Dreamed me». ((I Dreamed?!  Dreamed of me,?!)) The duet was so pleasant to the public, that it has been decided to make a joint clip — Victoria's first video.
 
[edit] """"Post-factory"""" life
 
[edit] 2005—2006
 
After the termination of the teleproject, Victoria began serious work Igor Matvienko. The debut clip of singer for the song """"Leila"""" was shot in 2005 in Thailand. New songs with which, Vika acted on the various platforms, new further clips have followed. In parallel with this development, Victoria's life was often discussed in press—in 2006, the singer dated the member of the group «Korni» Pavel Artemyev. Although the affair did not last long, it has left a trace — a clip plot on a song of Dayneko «I will simply leave from you at once» (""""Я просто сразу от тебя уйду"""") based on the idea of director Victor Priduvalov and a hit has been closely connected with the Korni’s clip «You want I will sing to you» (""""Хочешь, я тебе спою"""")
 
[edit] 2007
 
In the beginning of 2007, Victoria wrote a soundtrack to the film «In expectation of a miracle» — «Film not about love».  A videoclip on this song was made in parallel with filming.
 
She was nominated in the autumn of 2007 as «Best performer» in the MTV Russia Music Awards. ((Fragment, as a result of having conceded to the singer MakSim.)) Also she was the winner channel Fashion TV award «fashion-singer of 2007».
 
In the beginning of the same year, Victoria took part in photos for April issue of magazine Playboy, which she has regretted.
 
In 2007 she also participated in the project Glacial Age. In this project she was """"star"""", being trained and supported by Alexei Yagudin — the first class figure skater. Victoria and Alexei reached the project ending, but did not reach prize-winning places.
 
With Alexei, Vika wrote a song """"Needle"""", of which there has been made a videoclip. There are rumours about a novel.  To date, theya re only rumours.
 
Also in 2007 Victoria tried out in film. She appeared in a a small, bit part, in a teleserial «Happy Together», where Vika has played herself; She has also has voiced the main heroine Panti in an animation «Noev an ark» with the Russian version of a Gloria Gaynor’s song «I Will Survive».
 
[edit] 2008— present
 
On 6 March 2008 She released a debut album """"Needle"""". The album became «the collection of hits of the singer» as it was the first album for 3 years of work. Now Victoria begins work on the second album.

"I'm going to be honest with you, I'm not going to pass your articles as GA, because frankly, they suck. But that doesn't mean an agreement can't be reached upon where your articles could still potentially reach GA.

First thing you need to know, is that Good Article status is a crock of shit. The criteria for it is a fair model, and it is not the problem. The problem is that it is not governed by a committee. Any bozo, like yourself, is allowed to review an article and ultimately decide if the article, in their mind, merits inclusion into CGD (Club Green Dot). The bar sits firmly in the mud. Snakes slither across it. My articles, on the other hand, never have enjoyed the benefits of exception. With extreme prejudice, they have been held to the highest possible standard set by the criteria.

Now we get to your GA review of Howling Bells, which I would like a full explanation for. That's one of the agreements that I have set forth, in order for you to avoid failure of your articles, by me. You can decide if you would like to abide by this resolution or not. Tell me something, are you on drugs, prescription or otherwise? If that offends you I apologize, but your review made me think of three things. Either somebody took a shit on your face and you couldn't see through it, you had a big D in your ass, or you were in a state of incoherence brought on by substance abuse. I must confess, I'm ashamed that I'm even having to talk to some punk ass high school kid who listens to crappy music. Not that I feel that I hold a higher place in this world than you, because Lord knows that's not the case. It's just that, I'm sittin' here having to deal with some goddamn little kid over the computer. Even at your age, I know you understand where I'm coming from.

There's not much of a reward getting an article to GA status, aside from that dot. A small part of me would like to see the article at GA, but it really doesn't concern me a whole lot whether it gets there or not. Howling Bells is at GA and that's basically good enough for me. As far as Halfway Gone goes, at this point, it's outta my hands. You're just gonna have to accept the fact the article could possibly be de-listed. Consider that your penalty for fuckin' around with other people's hard work.

Ok, so there are two agreements I have come up with that I think are very acceptable.

A full explanation of your GA review of Howling Bells (album). I'll guide you through it on the review page. If you decide to play ball, good on ya.
You must say the following to me, here on my talk page: I, , am just a punk ass teenager, who loves Justin Beiber, loves the crappy music of Justin Beiber, and loves crappy music from many other crappy artists.
The font has to be huge too, none of this small crap. Also, see if you can do it in some kind of color, that would be cool.

Now, I will not pass your articles if you agree to this, but I will not fail them. Instead, I will explain on the review pages that any reviewing of the articles that I have done up until this point should be disregarded.

"""
Actually, Nin Einne is right. I'll try to explain why. First thing: all scientific information (i.e. somewhat accurate info...) should be publically verifyable, where verifyable means that one can check whatever is claimed, and public refers to the fact that anyone can do that. Now, if you cite some source, like in the example above, it says """"blah blah near daily""""(citation number). Unlike what you might think, that does not mean that the sentence """"blah blah near daily"""" is a universally accepted fact  as proven by the fact that you have another opinion. What the phrase """"blah blah near daily""""(citation number) actually means is """"in (citation number), someone claims blah blah near daily"""", which, you'll agree, is fully correct. After all, that is what's written there and anyone can look at the source (because it's public) and read what is says (verifyable). Now, if you think that blah blah occured daily an not near daily, that is fine. But how should you go about it ? One thing you can not do: change the sentence and leave the citation! Because then it would mean: """"in (citation number), someone claims blah blah daily"""". That is not true! If you look at the source, you'll see it says """"blah blah near daily""""! Which is just what Nil Einne pointed out. Of course it can happen that what's written in the source is not accurate. But that doesn't mean you have the right to change it as you did.
What you can do is add another source that contradicts the first one. You could write It has been reported that """"blah blah near daily""""(citation number), but I think that """"blah blah daily"""". The moment you do this, however, you'll find that people will object, because what you have presented is not publically verifyable. So, what is needed here is a source, a pointer to publically verifyable information, to support your claim. The full list of newspapers would be ok, but very unpractical. If there is a single list somewhere, preferably produced by a fairly neutral source such as United Nation observers of something equivalent, that would be much easier.
You might think it's much more important to tell the truth accurately, even if you don't find a source, because, after all, the truth is what it's all about. Unfortunately, there is no such thing as the truth, a universally and unanimously accepted version of events, and certainly not in the Israelian-Palestian conflict. Imagine for a moment that everybody would put their version of the truth on the page, and what the page would then look like! So, we are bound by certain rules that allow us to govern information about events without spiraling into chaos, and these very rules that exist to create accurate information state that sticking to the rules is more important that providing accurate information. Strange as it may seem, it works: even when not perfectly accurate, the result will not stray to far from the truth, if there is any one such thing, and that result is usually a fairly useful document as opposed to a flamewar.""",0.0

"XENODONTLIKEIT 

Typically, when Xenophrenic sees a valid edit (by wiki policy) that he disapproves of (for whatever reason), he seeks to get others to remove it. This strategy is quite effective as he says the edit needs balance, or needs the proper context, or isn't the full story, etc. There are many different reasons used, but the end result is him adding so much trivial nonsense ( > 2 to 1 ratio in his POV) that average editors cringe when they see it. Xenophrenic then declares that the original unbalanced POV version can ONLY stay if his even more unbalanced additions are there to provide proper balance. This leads to edit warring over days and even weeks, articles often get locked down. Some reasonable and responsible editors step in and remove it all in the name of peace and to move forward in improving the article. Xenophrenic gets what he wanted all along, and boosts his edit count with the disruptive edit warring. Some call this tactic a form of wiki-terrorism, I say it shows that Xenophrenic is quite calculated and intelligent (not a terrorist), even though he is mostly obtuse during discussions.",0.0

"Re:Mere Rubbish ==
I also think it is mere rubbish but I also think it is not completely rubbish. According to the southeast asian history, most of the ancient rulers of this region are Hindus, some rulers came from Persia (map covered Middle east, Greece, west India - Achaemenid Empire, Seleucid Empire, Parthian Empire and Sassanid Dynasty, please look at the size of the map their conquered). Kedah is a good example where the king from Persia came and eventually he built a kingdom.

In the old days, it was slavery society (no sultanate and no democracy yet), all Hindu rulers belong to higher class, common peoples and the natives belong to inferior slave class. The Hindus rulers came from India and Persia and they ruled most of the southeast asia, they called themselves high class peoples, the rest are merely slaves. Parameswara is a Hindu ruler, he is one of the descendants of the Hindu royal family that belong to higher class of Hinduism.

As for the Macedonian bloodline, this is also not completely rubbish. In the old days, the Persian empire was so big, they are so proud with king Alexander the Great. Also, they ruled some of the southeast asian lands such as the Angkor, Pasai, etc. Parameswara later married Pasai's princess and adopted Persian Shah and claimed as descendant of Alexander the Great, I don't think all this is completely rubbish.

Anyway, please correct me, I may be wrong too.

 Terminology 

They are substantives derived from the French verb """"tracer"""", which normally means """"trace"""",[9] or """"trail"""" (as in """"he escaped without a trace"""").[10]

The """"trail"""" bit, along with its explanation, doesn't seem to make much sense to me. The verb """"tracer"""" is commonly used in French slang to denote fast movement. In the lexicon used in footnote [9], the most accurate definition would be II A 3: """"Marcher vite"""", (""""walking fast"""")and """"filer"""" (""""to go fast""""). This is consistent with most of the synonyms of """"tracer"""" that denote movement, such as """"aller très vite""""  or """"courir""""  .

It ties in with the fact that parkour is described as """"moving around obstacles with speed and efficiency"""".

And finally, it also corresponds to the article about """"traceur"""" on the French site: """"tracer au sens familier de se déplacer à vive allure""""

From a wiki perspective it would seem that he's violated SELFCITE, a bit of SELFPROMO and certainly NPOV, however one could also consider his edits as a publication style. It's common for authors of reference books, particularly professors, to add footnotes after all and I find this to be a more plausible view. In my view, the way he is working over an entire article to achieve this is further evidence that, while it violates NPOV, he is not doing it maliciously as other self promoters do. His willingness to discuss puts him well above the bar of the usual self promoter. and he's not pushing his only publications as viable sources nor is he unwilling to seek consensus.

Even though I write most of this, I have to totally admit after reading it from start to finish that this article is a right mess.

Another thing I see wrong is the lack of flow, the article jumps about a bit from one subject to another in the same paragraph, the idea of a paragraph is to keep to one subject, then if the subject changes, start a new one, looking back at what I've done, I've gone against the basic rules of paragraphing.

"Zoe had to go, and that is not a personal attack, but fact. Her reprehensible conduct was antithetical to free speech and undermined the very purpose of this site: the democratization of public information. 

You must understand that the concentration of power into the hands of a few administrators over an organization originally dedicated to open discourse and conversation is a bad thing. Please, tell me you understand that? 

The fact that users, much like yourself and very certainly like Zoe (she was the personification of such disgusting aggression and bullying) casually ban editors with whom they have disagreements, that they randomly delete articles (often with no debate whatsoever) because they find them distasteful, that they threaten editors who dare challenge their bellicose absurdity, is not a good thing.

The user Mongo alone has literally hundreds of documented incidents of gross power abuse and often outright vandalism himself (see the ED article on him). 

We live in an age when our Constitution is under attack on all fronts, when our phones are tapped, our mail is read, our bank accounts are sifted through, our libraries are monitored by the FBI, our civil liberties are disregarded, and freedom in the Land of the Free is driven back. 

We need as much freedom of speech as we can get, and Wikipedia is an excellent repository for the endangered right. The lack of respect for the First Amendment here truly scares meand shows ample cause for the political decay in this country.

I am very concerned about the removal of edits above from this talk page. I especially feel it is very important that since  72.139.185.19 continues to edit this article regularly that the community know about his use of a template which ridicules disabled children. Some acts of vandalism are so offensive, e.g. extremely prejudicial/racial name calling, that they must be known about by the community rather than just swept under the carpet. Think Mel Gibson and if there was attempts to censor reporting of what he said just because he apologized. Wikinews means no censorship.  
I agree and 72.139.185.19 should not be allowed to continue deleting comments relating to his offensive and blockable template. An editor who would use a template making fun of retarded children, even once, has no place here and is not welcome,imo. 72.139.185.19 has had so much editing on this article and discussion that I agree with  that a review of the deletions from this discussion page is desperately needed.",0.0

 Hey What's Up 

Hey Pink Floyd guy,
I started editing on Wikipedia just to keep my mind occupied, I'm going through deep shit, when I started reading the factual errors and the sick shit like mentioning mortality, dying and suicide on the prognosis section of anorexia nervosa, I started contributing out of altruism. 

Wikipedia occupies the first spot on most searches, for self righteous, incompetent dickheads ( can I say that or am I violating WP:Dickhead?) to claim ownership and disseminate bullshit is wrong, it makes Wikipedia look bad and more importantly people are getting bullshit information. 
There is one particular individual who seems to clamor for attention, his 15 minutes of fame went to his head. All the articles he created are one sentence to a paragraph long. To up his """"look at me"""" count he merely transferred sections that other people created to make it look like an article he started. I read extensively about him, he is a publicity hound and I find his behavior pretty frigging disturbing. Soooo I'm not going anywhere. I just have to cool out with my childish hissy fits and use the WP:Blah Blah and according to WP:Yadda Yadda B.S. 

My life is a bit of a horror show right now, so I might not be able to edit anything after tonight, but don't let a dickhead screw-up what could be meaningful information for other people. Proper knowledge can help people, like your information on Rumination syndrome. Whether or not some dick (WP:Dickhead?) has a college degree or is a physician means squat. I'm going to undue some damage tonight, I think there was useful information on some of those pages if I can't get back for a while don't let dickheads fuck it up. (Can I say fuck it up?)

Telephone waiting period
I've removed this citation of an example:

 For example, before privatization, a consumer or business would need to wait up to 10 years to get a local telephone line installed from the monopolistic state-run telephone company. A couple of years after privatization, the wait was reduced to just a few days.

This unsourced claim had been challenged and now someone is claiming personal experience as the """"source"""" (which would make it original research).  The citation of a precise period of this magnitude for installation of a phone line isn't especially incredible, however if it's true it should be reliably sourced. Tony Sidaway """,0.0
"""= Comments by likebox ===

I am quite familiar with the completeness theorem.  It does not show that recursive functions are representable in arithmetic - that proof of representabilily is the first third of the proof of the incompleteness theorem. There is simply no way to prove the incompletness theorem without some sort of arithmetization result.  And Godel's original proof did explicitly develop a formula for Bew...

The idea that the recursion theorem can be avoided by a reference to some sort of """"quine lemma"""" is interesting, but there is no result well-known as the quine lemma, and the result needed here is not just the existence of a quine but the existence of a fixed point for a certain recursive operator. Only the recursion theorem is going to give you that. 

Statements such as 'It only requires a great deal of effort if you do not understand it. If you understand it, it is obvious. """" seem to indicate some unfamiliarity with the idea of a mathematical proof. The idea is to justify statements to a level where they are convincing to the intended reader. """"Either you get it or you don't."""" is not the way things are proved in mathematics. 

Can you say what you disliked about the rewritten version? I tried to keep the informal tone while not having all the terminological errors and vague claims of the """"modern proof"""".— Carl ( · talk)

I know that the question mark balls are used as wild cards, but I don't understand the following. """"A variety of unusual situations can arise during a game.
