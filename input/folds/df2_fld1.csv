Spanking a kid doesn't tell a kid *why* not to engage in a behavior; it only teaches them to fear the consequences of the behavior, which might temporarily fix the problem, but if a parent takes the effort to make it clear to the kid why the behavior is wrong, model correct behavior, reward for good behavior, and discipline them properly only if it continues, then that will correct it in their head.

"It’s definitely partly the cause, but the cause affects how the kneeling is interpreted. Kneeling for veterans seems like an additional show of respect for our country and those who have served; kneeling for BLM-inspired protest of perceived injustice to African Americans at the hands of police feels to people like a statement that (1) lumps all police officers together as bad, (2) divides black vs white, (3) exaggerates a problem that is actually affecting all races, and (4) judges our country as a place not worthy of respect because it is seriously impeding the black race in 2018. Add to that that the controversial, predictably triggering action is being done at work before a game meant to entertain. 

For those who interpret it that way, including some black people, it seems like the wrong time and place, as well as too easily misinterpreted.

Seriously? As a matter of canonical law the Church is fine with (and encourages!) non-procreational sex as long as its within marriage? What the heck ever happened to Genesis 38:9-10?

While you could outlaw this practise, it seems like something that'd be difficult to get at, and I'd rather have the incest banned in general than risk such situations from happening. 

That said, there's always prosecutorial discretion. If it seems obvious that two siblings have had sex and there's been no grooming or anything like that, a prosecutor could just choose not to press charges.

If you make $40,000/year, that's basically your take-home after taxes. So, unless both partners are high wage earners, it usually makes more economic sense for one to stay home.

"It’s common for ex-addicts to view their poison of choice as more harmful because of the associated personal harm they’ve experienced from it. 

I do agree somewhat with your point however, it is somewhat bizarre that such a dangerous drug is viewed so brazenly. 

Two things; 

1) drinking in moderation is not especially dangerous (there is a very small increase in cancer/vascular disease risk) 

2) alcohol use is far more widespread than any other drug, so the harmful effects are seen far more often. 

I think you’re letting your history cloud your thinking (with all due respect).

You guys might want to broaden your horizons a bit by looking across the Atlantic. There is quite a successful model in many European countries when it comes to healthcare. In Germany we believe that capitalism needs to be regulated by the state because markets do not solve all problems. It is called social market economy an works quite well since the second work war. We have a healthcare system for everyone and free university education! The funny thing is that the money to start this system came from the us marshal plan after ww2 since America was afraid west Germany would turn a communist country if the markets are not somehow regulated. You will find similar systems in Switzerland and the Scandinavian countries.For us Europeans it is very difficult to understand how a first world country cannot provide healthcare for all of its citizens.,0.487152034261242

The arguments I gave also do not end with ""Therefore God is possible."" They end with variants of ""Therefore God exists."" If you accept the premises then the conclusion necessarily follows. Some may not seem as obvious (such as the Kalam) but when parsed out leads to a powerful, immaterial, personal cause that exists outside of time and space. 

The argument for the resurrection uses the Bible but I don't assume that the Bible is the word of God or even accurate when I use it. I treat it as a historical document and use principals found in Bayesian probability theory to make the case for the most likely explanation.

"Wikipedia articles cite percentages between 3.5 and 15% whereas the former is often considered too conservative so I'd say you have a point OP. 

However I urge you to consider the motive behind incarceration as it occurs in the US and many other countries now. As I see it there are 4 main motives:

1) Punishment

2) Rehabilitation

3) Deterrent

4) Protection of ""normal"" citizens.

I would argue that if you look at the outcome (high sentences, strong chance of actually getting worse in prison, sexual violence, overcrowding, etc.) you would conclude the obvious motive almost entirely number 4. If you rehabilitate in jail that's great and I suppose you'll be supported, but its clearly not the main driving force. So the question perhaps should be rephrased to *""what do we as a society want the result of incarceration to be?""*",0.38650963597430404

That isn't true. There is another way to reduce the differnce. Instead of stripping the agency of young women away, you could strip the agency of young men away.
