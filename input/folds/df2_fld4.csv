"""science"" is an idea and a process, nobody claims that science is a physically existing entity. Science does not exist, it happens.

As for God, your own definition is: ""I define God as the greatest conceivable being.""

The idea of ""greatness"" is ontologically meaningless, unless you mean sheer size. The same goes for other attributes of god: Most good, the ultimate truth, the ultimate prefection, the all-knowing being etc.

These qualities are purely subjective and do not make sense in objective reality outside human perception.

So, the question is: ""does the Greatest Conceivable Being exists?"" and the answer is obviously: no, because that question is nonsensical.

This sentiment supports the concept of your sex/gender being based on your external physical attributes. It ignores that your brain is very much a physical component of your body, and it's there in the brain that people are Male or Female or SomethingElse.

There is no ""becoming a woman"" or ""becoming a man"". There are only techniques people use to make their outward appearance align with their internal sense of self so they don't feel a jarring reaction every time someone says they are something they are not.

I would strongly encourage you to educate yourself more on this issue, because you'll draw a lot of false conclusions if you don't understand the nature of how sex/gender really behaves scientifically as well as socially/culturally.

"The research I've seen indicates obesity takes 3 years off your life on average. Comparing the US to, say, the UK we have 11.3% more of our population that's obese. That would correlate with a 0.339 year difference in longevity.

The United States has an average longevity of 79.3 years. In the United Kingdom it's 81.2, or 1.9 years longer. Thus cursory analysis would show obesity differences account for about 19% of the total.

The more striking difference is the difference in cost. The UK achieves that average while spending $5,963 less per person per year on healthcare. That's $472,866 less over a typical lifetime for an individual. ",0.30888650963597425

It also makes me incredibly mad when people don’t want to help themselves. I’ve had friends throw away their prescriptions because “they don’t work” when they were still staying up all night, eating unhealthy, not exercising, and doing other drugs. Depression and anxiety is a sickness that can be treated. Our societies romanticizing of it is sickening to me.

"The protests might have been about police brutality when it was Kaepernick and one other guy doing it, but this really blew up after Trump said the NFL should fire players that take a knee during the anthem. After that, a whole bunch of players started doing it, so that tells me it was more of a ""fuck Trump"" thing. Then you have instances like LeSean McCoy doing calisthenics during the anthem, the Ravens kneeling for the US anthem and then standing for ""god save the queen"" in the UK, and Marshawn Lynch sitting for the US anthem in Mexico, but standing for their national anthem \(cause Mexican cops totally aren't corrupt or brutal\).   


So yes please point out where those who are against the protests are missing how ""respectful"" it is

Theoretically, if the government wanted to destroy a disfavored religion (or it decided that all religions were disfavored), it could contrive a reason to impose really burdensome taxes on it to the point where it can no longer function (priests need to eat, and churches need to keep the lights on).

Marty seems staunchly against the release of player salaries because he sees them as too skewed, non-contextual, and inflammatory for the value they might provide to the players who need the information.

Same for married women, if, let's say, her husband has let himself go and she just doesn't fancy him any more for sex, but he's still useful for putting shelves up.

Wives do not 'allow' husbands to do things, and vice versa. Marriage is a partnership. If one side of that partnership is not happy with an aspect of it, they need to discuss it.

If one partner (wife or husband) wants to sleep with other people, and the other is ok with it then fine.

"You’ve mentioned that the particulars of the person or situation don’t matter but here is an extreme situation based on sadly common real life events: a person in an abusive relationship was told by their partner that they could not drink or wear certain clothes because they would “embarrass themselves.” In this instance, avoiding alcohol with the abused partner, whose normal alcohol intake was previously 1-2 drinks with other individuals who were also recreationally drinking and no solo drinking, would be complicit in engaging with the abusive partner’s controlling demands. This is a tricky situation - a morally gray area - where the assumptions underlying the drinking are particularly salient. In this case, offering a sip or one drink may be a fast way to challenge some of the assumptions underlying the refusal as well as model that the abusive partner does not necessarily control others’ behaviors.

You guys might want to broaden your horizons a bit by looking across the Atlantic. There is quite a successful model in many European countries when it comes to healthcare. In Germany we believe that capitalism needs to be regulated by the state because markets do not solve all problems. It is called social market economy an works quite well since the second work war. We have a healthcare system for everyone and free university education! The funny thing is that the money to start this system came from the us marshal plan after ww2 since America was afraid west Germany would turn a communist country if the markets are not somehow regulated. You will find similar systems in Switzerland and the Scandinavian countries.For us Europeans it is very difficult to understand how a first world country cannot provide healthcare for all of its citizens.,0.487152034261242

I would argue that if you look at the outcome (high sentences, strong chance of actually getting worse in prison, sexual violence, overcrowding, etc.) you would conclude the obvious motive almost entirely number 4.

"Prostitution is usually prohibited because of reasons unrelated to prostitution itself, e.g the country's economy. The ""2 consenting adults"" isn't always the case. Instead, poor girls become prostitutes because they don't have any other real choice

Another problem is, its very difficult to identify necessity for spanking in each case. abuser will claim that it was a teaching in court.",0.5872591006423983
